<p>My website stopped working recently.  More accurately,
<a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> stopped rendering the /blog and /journal
portions of my website.  The last time it worked was 2 weeks ago.  I
noticed that my local version of Hugo had gotten updated (*) and
checked the releases.. sure enough there was a change to something
related to that I had tweaked regarding indices.</p>

<p>The problem languished for a while until I remembered that <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/04/11/netlify-plus-hugo-0.20-and-beyond/">Netlify
allows choosing which version of Hugo to use</a>.</p>

<p>That, along with building every branch, allowed me to test at exactly
<em>which</em> version of Hugo my site stopped being rendered properly.</p>

<p>I had already created a mini version of my site, so I whipped up a
shell script <code>netlify.sh</code>to slap a bunch of different branches with different
versions of Hugo requested.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

VERSION=$1
BRANCH=hugo${VERSION//\./}
FILE=netlify.toml

echo &quot;version $VERSION&quot;
echo &quot;branch $BRANCH&quot;

git checkout master
git branch -f $BRANCH
sleep 1
git checkout $BRANCH

sed -i '' s/&quot;0.54.0&quot;/&quot;$VERSION&quot;/g $FILE

git add $FILE

sleep 1

git commit -m &quot;Hugo $VERSION

to narrow down when it stopped working&quot;

sleep 1

git push origin $BRANCH

sleep 1

git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>sleep</code> commands are there to keep git from locking itself out of the directory.</p>

<p>This allowed me to run</p>

<p><code>./netlify.sh 0.45</code></p>

<p>where 0.45 is a version number I wanted to test.</p>

<p>I thereby created a bunch of branches&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>* 77836e3 (origin/hugo0471, hugo0471) Hugo 0.47.1

<p>And Netlify quickly created all of them so I could figure out which
ones worked and which ones did not.</p>

</ul>

<p>etc etc</p>

<p><em>None of them worked!</em></p>

<pre><code>(☉_☉)
</code></pre>

<p>(*) The fact that the local version had gotten updated automagically
should have been a clue that the auto-updating Hugo had <em>not</em> caused
the problem.  I had no idea when the updates happened, but the problem
suddenly started, and I assumed an update was the cause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="it-was-my-mistake-all-along">it was my mistake all along</h3>

<p>In an attempt to fix my top page, I had tweaked this and that, where
this and that are the main repo site, and sub-module theme,
respectively.  During the process, I did not notice that I had also
broken the entire site. Part of the not noticing was due to the
current way I have Hugo set up, it does not wipe the output <code>public/</code>
directory before creating the site.  (Although I intended to and
thought I had activated that option.)</p>

<p>here&rsquo;s where it gets tricky.  My current site consists of multiple
submodules, the two mentioned above, a couple others which have not
changed in months (years), and my journal entries, which currently has
8500+ files.  There are enough journal files that when I try to run
Hugo on my site locally, it crashes with too many files open.  I
cannot let Hugo watch for changes so I have to restart Hugo each time
I make a change.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see if I can offload that task to Netlify.</p>

<p>Basic idea:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with my local website repository</li>
<li>Wipe all files from the public/ directory</li>
<li>Copy the remaining files to a new directory</li>
<li>git checkout abcdef123 &ndash;recurse-submodules</li>
<li>Create a branch</li>
<li>Push to Netlify</li>
</ol>

<p>or</p>

<ol>
<li>Wipe most of the journal entries</li>
<li>Run the code locally</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="12-56-wednesday-25-september-2019-jst">12:56 Wednesday 25 September 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Getting closer.  I made a script I called <code>commitlify.sh</code></p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

COMMIT=$1
BRANCH=hugo_${COMMIT//\./}

echo &quot;commit $COMMIT&quot;
echo &quot;branch $BRANCH&quot;

rm -rf public/

ls public/

git checkout $COMMIT --recurse-submodules

git branch -f $BRANCH

sleep 1

git checkout $BRANCH

sleep 1

git push origin $BRANCH

sleep 1

hugo server -w=0
</code></pre>

<p>It does a similar thing as the previous script, but deals with
submodules being aligned with the main repo&rsquo;s HEAD.  The last line
tells Hugo to serve the site, but not to monitor it for changes.</p>

<p>This is fine for now because I am just poking around to see which
commits were breaking commits.</p>

<h5 id="21-58">21:58</h5>

<p>I found a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/purehugo/commits/16559a8ffa3ec74f57af7398a90f259f41972675">breaking commit that used to be a genius commit</a>, but
apparently its genius did not survive changes in Hugo.</p>

<h5 id="00-32-thursday-26-september-2019-jst">00:32 Thursday 26 September 2019 JST</h5>

<p>And now I have gotten enough of the errors out of the system that I
can get Netlify to build <em>something</em> with the repo.  I still do not
have /blog nor /journal indices working, but getting closer.  There
were a couple of commits that did work, so .. oh I can try one now.</p>

<p>Dangit.  There are different errors with some commits I marked as
working in my local setup.</p>

<p>Too tired to work on it now.  good night!</p>

<h5 id="22-20-thursday-26-september-2019-jst">22:20 Thursday 26 September 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Yayyy!!  As of today, I got an <a href="https://new-robnugen-com-fallible-abandoned-58f942.netlify.com">old version of my site</a> working on
Netlify.</p>

<p>Both the
<a href="https://new-robnugen-com-fallible-abandoned-58f942.netlify.com/journal/">journal</a>
and
<a href="https://new-robnugen-com-fallible-abandoned-58f942.netlify.com/blog/">blog</a>
have their own pages, and the top page shows just the blog entries.</p>

<p>The pagination on the top page is messed up, but now that I have
something working, I can ask peeps on the Hugo forum for help on
that.  My attempt to fix that is what broke my site in the first
place.</p>

<p>Okay..  now to get my journal entries and blog entries up to date!</p>

<p>Go to main repo directory</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/journal-hugo
</code></pre>

<p>Keep track of the old master branch</p>

<pre><code>git branch -f old_master c670763
</code></pre>

<p>Move the master branch to the branch that is working now (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/journal-hugo/commits/bbfbe552a5a6f8b9337af3ac41ee359250a309df">bbfbe552a5a6f8b9337af3ac41ee359250a309df</a>)</p>

<pre><code>git branch -f master
</code></pre>

<p>It took 45 minutes to deploy before, so this may be up in 45 minutes.
<a href="https://new-robnugen-com-fallible-abandoned-58f942.netlify.com">https://new-robnugen-com-fallible-abandoned-58f942.netlify.com</a></p>

<p>Oh dang, I triggered a deploy by uploading my latest journal without
uploading this latest change.</p>

<p>Moe Joe.  AB server ELB is causing or revealing 502s.  Locally, I
rebooted my elderly Macbook and the USB cable is still not working.  I
reset the printer system and the printer still will not print.  I
tried to copy a document and the printer would not copy it.  And
latest version of Hugo is <em>not</em> creating my website subdirectories
(/journal or /blog).</p>

<p>(My printer&rsquo;s scan-to-server function is working, though.  yay!!)</p>

                        <p>I have often wondered about ways to write journal entries on some small device and incorporate them into my online journal.</p>

<p>I used to use a Handspring Visor, until the foldable keyboard folded for the last time and the Visor perhaps got replaced with a laptop?  It had some way to sync, probably USB.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve got a handheld screen here with Swype keyboard, and I am writing this as an email to myself which I hope to remember to cut and paste into a full on my local file system and incorporate into my git repository for journal entries.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m headed to Rin&rsquo;s monthly planning workshop in Omotesando.  This will be my second time to attend, and I intend to focus on workshops and, curiously, my website.</p>

<p>I want to continue using my existing git repositories (one for the journal, and one for the site itself (because my journal has lasted longer and should stay intact as much as possible (plus I want to keep up my single word commit messages that tell a story, backwards), as if a repository in a fragile file system supports that) which includes the journal as a sub module), even though &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; is like &ldquo;just use Squarespace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorry, nope. Not gonna use Squarespace or WordPress or Ghost.  I&rsquo;ll continue to use Hugo, markdown, and my choice of hosting providers.  I just need some adjustments to my theme.</p>

<p>Specifically, I&rsquo;d like to add some testimonials to my about page, find a nice design for my schedule of workshops and perhaps tweak my tags list to show how many entries are tagged with each tag.</p>

<p>Those changes are of the top of my head, but when it comes time to do them, I get caught up in minutae, like how to adjust the left padding on the border of some div.  Annoying.</p>

<p>Excitingly, I&rsquo;d also like to get feedback on how I can approach the detail of being in the US for three weeks in October.  Any way to continue workshop momentum?  Any need to?</p>

<p>I wrote a post on Hugo forums to find a site designer who can make a
nice design for Marble Track 3.  As of this writing, the website uses
my tweak of Castanet, and looks like this
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190111132634/https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3 site v2 (via archive.org)</a></p>

<p>Because the project takes some time to explain, I want the website to
quickly give people an overview, and allow people to click in to get
more details if they like.</p>

<p>One designer replied to my Hugo post.  We had a chat and this is their
first design iteration.
<a href="https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/">https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/</a>   I made a rough copy
here <a href="https://vigilant-mayer-608cf8.netlify.com/">https://vigilant-mayer-608cf8.netlify.com/</a></p>

<p>One thing Jimmy noted was they used a hexagon motif where circles
would be more appropriate.  I spent a couple hours trying to reverse
engineer SVG paths</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://svghelper.com/">https://svghelper.com/</a> for helping me create this shape</p>

<pre><code>HI Sanjay

Thank you for the design.

I really like the video embedded in the header graphic, but it seems too dark to me; can it be made somewhat lighter color?

I like that the site is responsive.

Easy changes:

1a) The VIDEO section should be directly below &quot;These guys are great!
Just look at them go!&quot;.  So please swap the order of OUR WORKERS to be
below VIDEO

1b) remove rectangle from around VIDEO section so it will seem
connected to above text &quot;Look at them go!&quot;

2a) In the TRACK (PARTS) section, the Made by sections should not have
a space before the colon (&quot;Made by: &quot; is correct)

2b) In the TRACK (PARTS) section, there should be no space before
commas after workers names (&quot;Dr Sugar, Mr McGlue, Squarehead&quot; is
correct)

3) My friend made a rough logo that can replace the four circles logo.
He will simplify it so it works at a small size

<pre><code>Harder changes

4) Please add a placeholder for the language selection.  There should
be two languages for now: English and Japanese

5) The hexagon theme doesn't make sense with the marbles; can the
theme be round instead of hexagons?  Here are some examples of
unnecessary hexagons, but there are many
more. https://www.deligence.com/clients/marbletrack3/images/hexline_2.png

<pre><code>5 suggestion (easy change)) For the workers, perhaps above could be
approximately this shape

&lt;/svg&gt;

6) Anchors in the top right for Twitter, Youtube, Github are too wide.
The anchors overlap so that when mouse cursor is over Twitter anchor,
the Youtube anchor is active.

<pre><code>7) FYI: The current site has no Javascript, so the new site should
still work without javascript.  (no fancy graphics need without
Javascript, but the site should work Web 1.0 if javascript is off)

8) There are many errors in browser console.  Please remove or repair the broken code

9) How do you plan to receive feedback from users?  This site will be
hosted on Netlify.

10) OUR WORKERS section should be dynamically generated so as I add
more workers, they will show up on the top page in OUR WORKERS
section.

best regards
Rob

<p>I have been working on a new version of Marble Track 3 website for a
few days..  The new version completely hides the livestreams and just
focuses on the workers, the track pieces they make, and people who
helped with the project.</p>

<p>There are a few rough spots, but it will likely be up within a week.</p>
