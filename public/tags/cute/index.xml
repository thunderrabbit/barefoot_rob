      <description>18:08 Wednesday 31 July 2019 JST Today the weather was quite lovely, so I spent some time outside repotting some baby plants that had come from Alex, who froze two winters ago.
The original Alex can be seen in the first two pics here.
     
20:12 Wednesday 31 July 2019 JST I just got super sidetracked looking for Alex pictures, after finding a journal entry with a missing image of Alex.</description>

      <description>12:51 Wednesday 08 July 2015 JST I violated my vow to not buy any more Apple hardware when I bought a DVI to VGA adapter so I can use my monitor with Tariq&amp;rsquo;s laptop, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have HDMI. Breaking my vow was totally worth it though; I got to meet a really nice employee who was so cute I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of what to say!! She brought back two lovely ten yen coins as part of my change and said she selected them for me, though I hadn&amp;rsquo;t mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;d like them.</description>
