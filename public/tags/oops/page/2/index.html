<p>Heh.  Well, it was pretty great.  Dirk Gently&rsquo;s Holistic Detective
Agency was good enough that I just watched the last four (4) episodes
in a row.  At 40+ minutes each that&rsquo;s 160+ minutes or about oh my god
I have to go to bed.</p>

<p>Now it is apparently canceled, but I hope not.

<p>We arrived and went to the baggage claim but, fortunately thanks to
Lin checking first, we discovered we could <em>not</em> get our checked
baggage in Dubai when staying in hotels in the airport.</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s awesome: the guy was like beep beep beep and said our
baggage would be redirected to Haneda just like that boom. Automatic
scanners and stuff.  I know it&rsquo;s both amazing and meh, makes sense.
Also awesome: we thereby did not have to pay a fee for overweight bags
despite this airport allegedly being strict.</p>

<p>We had to go through security again, but I guess we couldn&rsquo;t get our
bags because they don&rsquo;t want us to escape into the city without visas,
which we don&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>Lin bought eyeliner during our 15+ minute walk to the hotel in
Concourse C, and is buying a T-shirt (and probably other stuff) now.
I showered and considered shaving but nah it can wait until we get
back.</p>

<p>Here is Brazil, cashew fruit are available at any fruit stand.</p>

<p>I tried the fruit.  So much water spilling out I think it should be
called watermelon.  Very stringy and not so delicious, but edible.</p>

<p>Once I finished the fruit, I looked at the stem looking thing.</p>

<p>Wait, so you&rsquo;re telling me there&rsquo;s a cashew nut in here?  That&rsquo;s
awesome!</p>

<p>It was too hard to crack with my fingers, so I used my teeth to try to
crack it open.  It was actually chewy, not hard, so I bit it again a
couple of times to try to get it to open.</p>

<p>Eww hang on, that tastes bitter.  Yo wow ow holy cats it&rsquo;s terrible
flavor.</p>

<p>I felt a tiny bit woozy walking to the bar to find something to wash
down the flavor.  Was it poisonous??</p>

<p>Here is what I wrote to myself:</p>

<h2 id="08-20">08:20</h2>

<pre><code>Note to self

Do not chew cashew nut case to get the cashew out

Worst taste ever

I have consumed
Two pieces of cake
One cup of yogurt
One glass of orange juice

And I can still taste the cashew shell flavor
</code></pre>

<h2 id="08-36">08:36</h2>

<pre><code>Cup of yogurt, cup of porridge, and 15 minutes later, I can still
taste it. It kinda feels like it damaged my tongue like a burn (acid)?
</code></pre>

<h2 id="08-41">08:41</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashew#Cashew_nut_and_shell">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashew#Cashew_nut_and_shell</a></p>

<pre><code>The shell of the cashew nut contains oil compounds which may cause
contact dermatitis similar in severity to that of poison ivy,
primarily resulting from the phenolic lipids, anacardic acid, and
cardanol. Due to the possible dermatitis, cashews are typically
not sold in the shell to consumers.
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks, Wikipedia!</p>

<p>While on the phone with BoA credit card to close my account, I got a
call from JB: &ldquo;hey yeah why aren&rsquo;t you at work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stomach sank link oh damn are you kidding me?</p>

<p>Turns out they hadn&rsquo;t sent me the schedule for December, but I
certainly could have been more proactive to check.  I have set a
reminder for the 28th of each month to make sure I have the dates in
my calendar for the subsequent month.</p>

<p>Well!  I discovered something new about Tokyo trains.  If I <em>promise</em>
to pay at the other end, it&rsquo;s possible to get a free entry ticket.  I
did not think to take a picture of the ticket, but its kanji started
with 無 and may have started with 無理 but I am not sure I can readily
identify the second kanji.</p>

<p>Anyway, I called Ty and he met me at his station to let me out.  And
gave me 1000 yen so I can get home and maybe get a bite to eat.</p>

<p>Headed to Paola&rsquo;s house now to enjoy lunch and laugh about leaving
wallets at home!</p>

<p>We stopped in a rest stop at 9:47, and the driver was like &ldquo;gonna
leave at 10 sharp so&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I bought a drink and headed back to the bus, and honestly got a bit
panicked when I couldn&rsquo;t find it (because I hadn&rsquo;t carefully noted its
location based on <em>immobile</em> surroundings. (okay okay I didn&rsquo;t really
note the location based on anything but a vague angle toward the rest
area entrance)).  Thank you, old man, who beckoned me around the new
buses which parked in front of our bus.</p>

<p>But Lin was still buying her drink and the timer was ticking 9:55:40
tick tock tick tock; she came on time, but she <em>also</em> got confused
when she couldn&rsquo;t see our bus, but thank me, her husband, for standing
where I could see her and the bus and holler &ldquo;babychan!&rdquo; when she
started walking the same wrong way I had to evaluate the other buses.</p>

<p>We got on the bus with 90 seconds to spare.  At 10:00, the driver got
up, counted the passengers (twice, I think) as he walked up and down
the aisle. 10:01 vroom vroom we&rsquo;re off, but the front middle passenger
seat is empty <em>except for a purse</em>.  Yikes.</p>

<p>(The title is in honor of Swa&rsquo;vet (1975 (or so) ~ 2007 (or so)) who,
while I was standing right next to her, said to me &ldquo;stop fuckin&rsquo;
around and call me,&rdquo; much to my amusement given that she had <em>just</em>
given me her number (and meant for me to call her later)).</p>
