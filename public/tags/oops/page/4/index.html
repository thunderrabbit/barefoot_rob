<p>Today I found a little computer touch screen terminal in Ebisu
station: &ldquo;Route Finder&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hmm! Well in time for the olympics! I decided to test the machine by
entering the two farthest cities I could think of at the moment:
Wakkanai and Nagasaki.  Now I realized Kagoshima would be further than
Nagasaki.</p>

<p>Next week, machine, be ready!</p>

<p>I showed it to the guy at the toy store, but then forgot to grab it on
my way out.  D&rsquo;oh!</p>

<p>Was planning to meet T and M at 3:30 but M&rsquo;s grandfather died and T
forgot to tell me the meeting was therefore canceled.  So we&rsquo;re going
to meet in about an hour from now.  While waiting, I&rsquo;m seated on
Yamanote Line, traveling from Tokyo to Shinagawa, the long way around.</p>

<p>(written 10:24 Tuesday 11 November 2014 JST)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m late writing this entry, but really late with the code.  It was
around the time that I was leaving the language school in Ebisu that
AB client requested a change.  The paper on which the request was made
got moved by over-eager cleaning and I just found it on Sunday,
whereas I think I had the meeting in August.  Oh fuck.</p>

<p>AB has also been busy, but damn I don&rsquo;t want to leave shit hanging
like that.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got the backend changes coded up yesterday, and I think I
found an even sweeter solution than I might have in August. I got a
bit of a start on the frontend, but I still need to dig in to remember
how it all works before I can do the rest.</p>

OPERATOR REPORT ERROR NOTICE

This is to inform you of a problem in your entry on the operator
report (log) for 6/17/00.

You forgot to include the time when you signed off on the log. 

Please fix your entry the next time you are at the station.  Thanks,

If you have any questions please ask your Program Director
or reply to this e-mail.
</pre>

<p><p>The above email is referring to the official FCC log.  It has
entries like this:</p>

<pre>
Time     Operator    ON/OFF
--------------------------
 4:01  (SigNatuRE)    ON
 7:02  (SigNatuRE)    OFF
 7:02  (sigNATure)    ON
       (sigNATure)    OFF
10:00  (SIgnaTUre)    ON
 1:00  (SIgnaTUre)    OFF
</pre>

<p><p>The different capitalizations of &ldquo;signature&rdquo; indicate different
people&rsquo;s signature.  DJ one signed on at 4:01 and off at 7:02.
Legally, the next DJ (in this case, me) must sign on at the exact same
time (in this case, 7:02)</p>

<p><p>When I sign on, I always also sign the next line and write OFF, but
leave the time space blank so it can be filled in when I leave.  That
way, if I forget to sign off, the next DJ can simply write in the time
s/he signed on into my off slot.</p>

<p><p>So this is the second week I&rsquo;ve forgotten, and I will accept full
responsibility for having forgotten.  I FORGOT TO WRITE DOWN THE TIME
THAT I LEFT THE STATION!!  There.  But, ya know, it seems to me that
the next DJ could just do the little favor and write down the time for
me.</p>

<p><p>I won&rsquo;t be there this Saturday; I may forget to mention it to the
next DJ, but I&rsquo;m going to ask the general manager if it&rsquo;s legal etc.</p>

<p class=date>Wednesday 21 October 1998</p>

<p>Yesterday was big fun at gymnastics.

<p>I've stopped practicing my round off back flips, and toned them down to round off back handsprings.

<p>Why? So I can do round off back handspring back flip, of course!  I've got to lower the angle/height/energy etc to get the back flip down to a back handspring.  I've also got to overcome my fear of bonking my head on back handsprings!  (That means I'll need to quit bonking my head by having my arms too far apart, and *that* means I'll need to continue stretching my shoulders so my arms can easily block my weight)

<p>Last night, BB (one of the coaches) would help spot me on the back handsprings.. Actually it was more of a psychological spot because he didn't actually help me over; he just stood beside me in case I crashed.  I would do a round off, stop, and then do a back handspring, with the goal of getting the stop to be shorter and shorter:  stop - stp - st - s -

<p>I became pretty confident at them (the confidence waxes and wanes) and only boinked my head a tiny bit once.  I even got the stop to be only a stp

<p>Near the end of the hour, I zipped over to the runway trampoline where Eric was trying some front flip half twist thing. We alternated passes on the trampoline, and I did my fun backflip, backflip, backflip, backflip, backflip with twist onto mat trick.  I get a teeny bit dizzy for a second after doing that!

<p>Then I was all, "I think I'll do a 1 and 3/4 front flip."

<p>The first one was nice.  {boingy} (flip fli) (land on back) Perfect.

<p>The second one was not as good.  {boingy} (flip fl) (land on head; hear a bit of a crunch in the neck)  Ow.

<p>BB was all, "Rob.  No.  Don't be trying that one again."

<p>I told him I woulda stopped anyway even without him saying so.

<p>"Good, because that was pretty spooky."

<p>"Well, at least it's near Halloween!"

<p>I went home and stayed up chatting with Jen over ICQ till damn 2am.

<p>This morning my neck is a bit sore, with slightly limited movement; I think I shall call my chiropractor now.
