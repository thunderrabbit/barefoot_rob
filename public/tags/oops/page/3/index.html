<p>You&rsquo;ve probably hear of blood blisters.  I have one on my thumb, a
result of clipping some thick twigs with scissor-sized loppers a
couple weeks ago.  The skin of my thumb got caught between the handles
as they thunked together and boom instant blood blister.  Yay!</p>

<p>A couple days earlier I had done the same thing to my index finger.
Scissor-sized loppers and oops blood blister on my finger!</p>

<p>Except there&rsquo;s a difference.  Two weeks later, the one on my finger
still hurts.  The one on my thumb stopped hurting at least a week ago,
and is just waiting for the skin to slough off.</p>

<p>The finger one has a slight lump under the skin and still hurts a
little if I press on it.  I&rsquo;m calling it a nerve blister!</p>

<p>Just for fun, I&rsquo;m at the clinic near our new house; I have some time
available as my afternoon meeting was canceled and the clinic is right
along the path between the station and our house.</p>

<p>I super doubt the doctor will suggest anything besides pain meds,
which I will politely refuse&hellip; but I just wonder if there&rsquo;s anything
to do with it besides wait.  I wish I could talk to Dr Cutie!!</p>

<hr />

<p>The recommended I go to a skin clinic, and gave me a map to the clinic.  Synchronistic: I had <em>just</em> walked &ldquo;randomly&rdquo; down near the skin clinic, so I knew exactly where it was and how to get there.</p>

<p>Man oh man I&rsquo;m lucky there aren&rsquo;t that many affected rows, but when AB
client requested that four fields in their main table allow DECIMAL
values and not just INTegers, I didn&rsquo;t change the
summary-of-main-table in the same way.  So each time a record was
saved to main table, its summary was saved with truncated values in
those fields.</p>

<p>Dang.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there aren&rsquo;t many times that decimal values are needed in
those fields.  (&hellip; which is why INTs worked for them originally.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fixed now, but I need to create a query that will return all main
field records with decimal values so AB staff can go back and update
the corresponding summary-of-main-table records as needed.</p>

<h2 id="16-33">16:33</h2>

<p>For the query I mentioned, I could simply define a query to do it,
which I&rsquo;ve done before, but all in code.  I wonder if I can set up a
query in the DB, give it some meta-data and let the code write itself?</p>

<h2 id="15-28-thursday-12-november-2015-jst">15:28 Thursday 12 November 2015 JST</h2>

<p>So I wrote half the code to allow queries to be stored in the DB, but
then abandoned it in favor of doing some other (higher priority (and
higher paying)) tasks first.</p>

<p>After a nice lunch, and a nice nap, I decided to break out the art
supplies and draw some art!</p>

<p>I brought four blank paperboard panels (I think they&rsquo;re called
shikishi in Japanese), some pastel colored markers, and some bright
colored markers.</p>

<p>Hmmm what to do, oh what to do.  This is always my question when
starting a new piece.  I decided to go with bright green.  I took out
the marker, started to draw a sweeping curve&hellip;. but no ink came out.
Actually it&rsquo;s paint, and I haven&rsquo;t used them in a while so maybe it&rsquo;s
just a bit dried out.</p>

<p>I poked the nib of the marker on my pants leg and got the paint
flowing again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t take a picture of the result just after it
happened, but the flight attendants were super friendly and
accomodated me with wet towels to clean the paint off my pants.</p>

<p>Dang. I try to be so careful to consume as little as possible, but I
guess those three or four hand towels can begin their new lives as
rags or maybe as filler for a landfill.  Sigh.</p>

<p>The flight attendants told me to not worry about the seat cushion,
saying the cleaning staff could clean it&hellip;  Yeah maybe, but that&rsquo;s
paint.  Unless these cushion covers are rated to be cleaned with
turpentine.</p>

<p><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/939251/how-where-does-redmine-calculate-store-spent-time">Redmine Q on
superuser</a>
took more time to research and write than to just rewrite all the time
entries (there are 9), but fuckit; what if I had a million entries?
or a quadrillion? (*)</p>

<p>I logged several time entries to an issue in project A, but they
should have been logged to an issue in project B.</p>

<p>I tried using Redmine GUI to edit the time entries to be associated
with the correct issue, but (because they&rsquo;re in different projects?)
the edit was rejected with &ldquo;invalid issue&rdquo; or something.</p>

<p>So, I logged in to mysql and edited the log entries:</p>

<pre><code>update time_entries set project_id=40, issue_id=2645 where
`issue_id` = 2643;
</code></pre>

<p>Issue 2645 now correctly shows the logged time entries, and the total
&ldquo;Spent time&rdquo;</p>

<p>Issue 2643 correctly does <em>not</em> show any time entries, but still shows
the old value for &ldquo;Spent time&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried refreshing the page, logging off and on, even using a new
browser, but the value for Spent time persists in issue 2643.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see a field named <code>spent_time</code> in TABLE <code>time_entries</code> or
anything that looks similar when searching for the field name in DB
<code>information_schema</code>.</p>

<pre><code>select * from columns where (column_name like '%spent%' OR
column_name LIKE '%time%') and table_schema = 'redmine';
</code></pre>

<p>How can I tell Redmine to update the value for &ldquo;Spent time&rdquo; after
manually editing entries in TABLE <code>time_entries</code>?</p>

<p>(*) then I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be using Redmine correctly.</p>

<p>I learned something about CB site after pushing a change to live
server: I need to test the mobile (and touch) sites locally as well.
I had tested the main site but not the others, so the usability team
tested them for me.</p>

<p>Errors poured in over night, but my phone was in quiet mode cause I
wanted to sleep so I didn&rsquo;t notice until morning.  Texted with Andrew
a bit to get it sorted, and got it sorted.</p>

<p>Great lovely walk from Shimotakaido to Shibuya but now I&rdquo;m late for
drinks with Muchan and Sarupapa at The Pink Cow!</p>

<p>Along the way, I met Mat from England but from OZ for past 7 years or
so.  He&rsquo;s on a week long jaunt through Japan on his way back home.</p>
