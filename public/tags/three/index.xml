      <description>14:08 Tuesday 14 November 2017 JST Funny to put it that way, but yeah today about 30 minutes per glued piece, if I recall correctly. I went to bed early last night and woke up early to get started on MT3.
Right now I am on the train so don&amp;rsquo;t have the clip ID handy.. oh but Chrome remembered it.
  And here is the livestream https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3jQqWMIZFA
I am optimistic that the pieces I glued in place will prove to have been glued in correct enough places to stay put.</description>
