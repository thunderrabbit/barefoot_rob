      <description>23:27 Wednesday 20 March 2019 PDT Been sick as a dog for most of it, but I have had a great time hanging out at Michael Monkey&amp;rsquo;s in Houston. Thanks to Great Granny Good Witch for driving me to the store today to buy clothes and toiletries which should last a good while.
She has a lot lot lotta masks from around the world!
I have made a good start on the puzzle in the dining room, first expanding the table, then adding more white backing, then rotating the inner white backing to reduce waste.</description>

      <description>11:36 Monday 09 October 2017 JST Lin likes dogs, so I plan to preview this movie to see if she&amp;rsquo;d like it.
11:41 Monday 09 October 2017 JST Just for the record, there were approximately 5 minutes of ads before the movie started after I pressed play.
11:58 Monday 09 October 2017 JST I turned it off. Bailey was poorly trained.</description>
