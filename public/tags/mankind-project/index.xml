      <description>08:48 Thursday 10 January 2019 JST Men,
Back when I joined Mankind Project in 1997, the New Warrior Training Adventure was the only way to get started in Mankind Project.
Attending the weekend was a life changing experience for me. It was on that weekend that I realized I was a man. It was during that weekend that I began to get over my fear of men.
Over the years, as an organization, Mankind Project has begun encouraging new men to sit in Open Circles (like the one we have in Tokyo) before attending the New Warrior Training Adventure (NWTA).</description>

Thanks to Richard for giving me constructive feedback on the first version which was basically The Agreements, which include a lot of what we can&amp;rsquo;t do. He suggested putting some of the benefits on the site first.</description>
