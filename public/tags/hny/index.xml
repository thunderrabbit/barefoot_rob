      <description>01:55 Tuesday 01 January 2019 JST 2019 is pretty easy to type because the numbers are right next to each other on both sides of the keyboard.
Lin and I went to her sister&amp;rsquo;s house for new years celebrations. Went to karaoke and then a Chinese izakaya (fusion?) before going to the local shrine where some guys were burning bamboo in metal drums.
We arrived home about an hour before 2019 and took turns taking showers.</description>

      <description>17:18 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 (SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil) 23:19 Sunday 31 December 2017 +04 (Dubai - United Arab Emirates) 04:20 Monday 01 January 2018 JST (Tokyo - Japan) We arrived and went to the baggage claim but, fortunately thanks to Lin checking first, we discovered we could not get our checked baggage in Dubai when staying in hotels in the airport.
But what&amp;rsquo;s awesome: the guy was like beep beep beep and said our baggage would be redirected to Haneda just like that boom.</description>
