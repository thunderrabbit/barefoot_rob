      <description>09:59 Saturday 05 November 2016 JST This is my fourth time recently to join the &amp;ldquo;evening sit&amp;rdquo; (which happens in the mornings for me).
11:09 Saturday 05 November 2016 JST It actually finished more quickly than I expected. It was an hour, but felt shorter than previous hours.</description>

      <description>09:13 Sunday 17 January 2016 JST Esther and I went to the river near the meditation center for a 20 minute meditation. I stared across the river at a rock on the other side.
Noticed how the stream was literally the archetype of the imagery for &amp;ldquo;stream of thoughts&amp;rdquo; as the water flows by.</description>

Two years ago I decided I would make a meditation time for iOS so I could inspire myself to meditate daily. It took ten days (according to git) and had all the features I needed: set the desired countdown time, count down, then count up after the time had finished!
That way, if I was having a good meditation, I could keep going and know how long I continued!</description>

Yesterday, someone was like, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll give anyone 500 bits to make some more givaways&amp;rdquo; so I made a thread on /u/BitTippers encouraging people to meditate.
Decided to make it a daily thing. I wonder how long it will last!

Nice, I just got a tip for 500 bits; that should pay for a few more days at least!</description>
