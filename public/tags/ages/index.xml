      <description>18:14 Friday 27 July 2018 JST Driving to Niigata is taking ages because of the speed limit and stuff, but we are having fun with Mikako in the car with us as Lin drives. I have never gotten a driver&amp;rsquo;s license in Japan, but it is long trips like this that kinda make me want to have one. Highway driving is no problem for me. It&amp;rsquo;s just the squirmy little streets near our house that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to navigate in a car (especially not a relatively big ass mini van like we have).</description>
