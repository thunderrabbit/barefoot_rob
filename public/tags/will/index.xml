      <description>22:29 Tuesday 05 December 2017 JST Though I got a seat so I could use my computer to write on the way home, I got sidetracked by having my hot milk tea bottle fall and roll under the seat as I was getting out my computer. Not wanting to juggle my computer and milk tea, I just ended up using my phone instead of writing. Still got a fair bit done, writing to Emmy and Will.</description>

      <description>13:39 Tuesday 07 November 2017 JST Okay it&amp;rsquo;s been a couple days, but we had a lovely weekend in Shimoda. So glad that Lin joined us! She said she had a great time. The weekend schedule was kinda freestyle, which caused a bit of consternation for some, but did not affect things too badly. I enjoyed getting to know everyone a bit better.
Yoga on Saturday morning was originally led by Lisa, but turned into acro yoga with people being angels, superman, partners, flippers, etc.</description>

      <description>18:47 Sunday 30 July 2017 JST Thanks to Rohini for inviting all the beautiful people who joined the Gunma adventure staying at Renee&amp;rsquo;s place.
Yesteray morning Lisa led yoga and later in the day she played an instrument with four strings. We tried doing some chanting with it, but no one knew the chants.
We went to the caves apparently dug by hand with a bunch of different statues (33?</description>
