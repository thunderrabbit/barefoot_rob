Subject: closing the house
To: wende

HI Wen

Thank you so so so so much for your work and for
closing on the house without me there.  I shall write
you a postcard today.

I *might* even call you, but that's not particularly
likely.

I love you tons and have had a great time.  I've
learned some about myself, and I see why this travel
thing is necessary in my life.  (necessary = critical)
but I'm not sure if I can explain it all yet.

I've had great trouble getting money, but I know how
to do it now.  No one will accept the AE banking card.
 But I can put cash on my MC; I hope it's not going to
cost a whole lot.  I think I've found a way to put
money on it with no charge at all.  (except for the
money.)

Huge hugs and huge love to you, my dear friend.

You are the best best best.  :-)!

Oh; I went to a rave last night and it was pretty good
considering it was a Monday night, when people should
be getting ready for school or work!  I was
propositioned for sex, asked for drugs, and asked if I
was from Denmark.  No way, got none, false.

Everyone here has a cell phone, and their ringers are
extremely cooler than ours.  Bronwyn even has a
hologram for the face of her phone.  Maybe we can get
those too, but I've just not seen them.  

I have pics of Big Ben, Westminster Abbey (I think),
The London Eye, Salvador Dali statue, all with KTRU
sticker prominently in the frame.  Funny.  :-)

I'm having trouble hanging up with you.  Maybe that's
why I shouldn't call.  Maybe that's why I should. :-)

     With Love
      - Rob!

<p><p>Cute Wende is sleeping on the couch here at work.  She now has Thursdays
off from work.  She brought lunch for us from (guess where?) James Coney
Island and then she was lookin&rsquo; pretty sleepy and I encouraged her to sleep.
She was thinking 20 minutes, but it&rsquo;s been longer than that now and I don&rsquo;t
think she has stirred.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been chatting over AIM with a few youth and all are excited about
Tulsa Rally this weekend!!  I&rsquo;ll take copious notes. The drive to Tulsa is
pretty long too.  Longer than to Port Aransas&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Work has been cool today, but we&rsquo;ve had some weird email problems.  We&rsquo;re
sending emails to some people and some of them are getting the attachments
correctly and some are not.  They are all on the same system apparently, but
something has got to be different about the setup..</p>

<p><p class=date>5:15pm</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh!  Laura just appeared with an enthusiastic &ldquo;boo!&rdquo; at my office
door!  How fun!!  She and Wende are talk talk talking.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure about what we may do tonight; my car is at the shop and I
need to go to see Kathy Fey.</p>

<p><p>Oh!!!  I can drive Wende&rsquo;s truck and Wende and Laura can go play until
I&rsquo;m done.  That will work.</p>

<p><p>See ya!</p>

<p class=date>2:17pm CDT Saturday 13 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Last night Wende and I had a great heart-to-heart conversation.
Short version is that I tend to bottle my anger when she gets bitchy
when she&rsquo;s hungry or tired.  She&rsquo;ll snap, and I won&rsquo;t respond at all.
I&rsquo;m afraid that if I do say something it will be really mean, so I
just don&rsquo;t say it.</p>

<p><p>We agreed last night that I would say it.  Wende understands that
no matter what I say in anger, I still love her bajillions.</p>

<p><p>I love our relationship.  I love that we communicate so well.
Great great great great great!!!</p>

<p><p>Today is my 11,000th day.  Bigger celebration than any birthday.
Even 30th.  When I got out of the shower, I found a card from Wende on
the sink. Inside is a Classic Pooh card.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be friends forever, won&rsquo;t we, Pooh?&rdquo; asked Piglet.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Even longer,&rdquo; Pooh answered.</p>

<p><p>I cried.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m sad that Wende is unavailable for the celebrations today.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>This morning I worked on labeling pictures in my <a
href="/cgi-local/images.cgi">archive</a>.  New pics are under
cats/spot_stairs and new notes are under &ldquo;Old Pics from UH&rdquo; (or
something like that).  Fun fun stuff!</p>

<p><p>I hope to get lots more pics today.</p>

<p><p>A month ago or so, someone broke into Wende&rsquo;s apartment and stole most
of her jewelry, including her Aggie Ring.  Of all the items, she says,
there&rsquo;s only 4 that she really really wants to have back.  Her Aggie Ring
is one of them.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday, she got a call from the Aggie Ring Office; her ring has been
found!</p>

<p><p>A (homeless?) woman tried to sell it so she could feed her kids.  Took
it to Sears and at first the guy was all, no, he wouldn&rsquo;t buy it.  But then
he saw it was an Aggie Ring.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you twenty dollars for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He bought the ring, called the Ring Office; they tracked down Wende.
 She&rsquo;ll meet the guy and get it back on Monday!</p>

<p><p>In awe of the Aggies
<br>- Rob</p>

<p>Wende and I spent the greater portion of today down south of downtown,
mostly at Ares Robotics where we are working on all four different
altars.  When we arrived, the table for the water altar had no legs and
no top. It was just a frame of two-by-fours.  A man named Terry worked
on it, adding the legs, reinforcing them, then adding the top.</p>

<p>During this time Wende and I spray painted our mountain fountain, first
with a rust proof primer, and then with two different colors of fleck
paint.  We spent a lot of time just waiting around until finally Wende
had to leave around 5:45pm.  It was difficult for us to feel like our
time was being used wisely; we played some, talked some, but mostly just
waited.</p>

<p>After Wende left, I drove down to Garden Ridge Pottery to find some fake
moss to line the bottom of the altar.  They didn&rsquo;t have plastic moss,
but some wood shavings painted dark green and light brown.  I bought 18
one pound bags of the wooden fake moss.  $2.88 + tax per bag.</p>

<p>Then to Home Depot where I bought a pump that will pump water up to the
top of the altar to rain back down upon it.  $52 + tax for it.</p>

<p>Back to Ares Robotics where I tested out the pump - it could spray a
spout about 4 feet in the air without a hose attached.  Nice!</p>

<p>It was pretty late so I headed home.  Wende completed her meeting and we
went to Taco Bell!  (Do you see a trend?)</p>
