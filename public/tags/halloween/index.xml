      <description>(transcribed from my diary)
31 October 1999
After dropping off youth at church, I went home, showered, picked up my friend Nancy and went to Molly&amp;rsquo;s Halloween Simpson&amp;rsquo;s party!
Marcel and Kayse were there! Big hugs to him (and dainty hug to her) Also John, Maggie, Eric, Meredith, Melanie, Steve, Nancy, my Nancy, and Kerry.
Apple bobbing contest was great fun! Boys against girls and we won barely! Steve was pretty slow and I was pretty fast to make up.</description>
