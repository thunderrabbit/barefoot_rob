<p>I contacted the organizer of TEDx Roppongi, which is scheduled for
November 3rd of this year.  I&rsquo;m not sure if I will end up helping with
that, but I&rsquo;m interested, because eventually I would like to speak on
stage at a TEDx event.</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m preparing for a workshop to be held on November
23rd, which will be an introduction to the men&rsquo;s group work that we
do.  We plan to allow only 12 new attendees to attend that workshop.</p>

<p>We have a typhoon coming apparently.  As always with typhoons in
Tokyo, I&rsquo;m not too worried.  The storms end up being less impressive
than a normal spring storm in Houston.</p>

<p>Mixed-gender group was cancelled today for the second week in a row
due to lack of attendance.  boo.</p>

<p>One of my new students paid me Friday yay.</p>

<p>So today was the big day! Got to assist Soness at TEDx Waseda as she
assisted all the speakers in the event. I helped Alan by recording
some audience reactions during the presentations.  I couldn&rsquo;t do many
because the camera couldn&rsquo;t discern much of the audience in the dark.
He recorded all the presenters and some audience reactions after the
show.</p>

<p>All the presentations were great!  Well, the ones in Japanese were
hard (near impossible) for me to understand, but the rest were great!
Yuji&rsquo;s was amazing for his first time up on stage.  I&rsquo;d love to give a
presentation that well!</p>

<p>Great to meet Rick (who flew in from LA to speak) and Mitsue, both of
whom I knew from Soness&rsquo;s
<a href="https://soness.teachable.com/courses/ted-worthy-application/">TED Worth Application</a>
course.</p>

<p>Great to see すん, and got to meet his friend はるき as well!  They
both came up from Yokohama, having been invited by Soness.  They&rsquo;re
taking her class on communication skills.  Met
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bannerline">Steve Marshall</a> after the
show and told him about Tokyo men&rsquo;s group.</p>

<p>Outside, Steve and Mitsue took pictures of Yuji, me, and my bare feet
for Pecha Kucha, and I got caught by the &ldquo;one&rdquo; security guard roaming
the campus on Saturday when I climbed up on a wall overlooking a
staircase.  Aww man it wasn&rsquo;t event at the deep part of the stairs!</p>

<p>We took a bus then subway to Shibuya (we = me, Soness, Yuji, Mitsue,
and Rick) where we ate 回転寿司 (かいてんすし) after visiting
Hachiko.  I chatted with Mitsue during dinner, talking about how I met
Lin and how she met her husband, and the history of flower arrangement
in Japan.  Turns out she is 9 (nine) days older than me.  Wow!!!</p>

<p>She also teaches English in Japan, so I invited her to the TESOL thing
tomorrow; we&rsquo;ll see if she comes!</p>

<p>Okay I just got to my station. bye!</p>

<p>Soness has spoken at a couple TEDx events, and given her extensive
training and experience on stage, I figure she can help me figure out
how to speak at Pecha Kucha, where I&rsquo;d like to present a presentation
on authenticity.</p>

<p>Synchronistically, Soness is leading an online workshop thing called
<a href="https://soness.teachable.com/courses/ted-worthy-application/">TED Worth Application</a>,
which I&rsquo;m taking!</p>

<p>Question 1:</p>

<pre><code>Who are you?  What's your message worth spreading?

    I attended a transformational weekend in 1997 called New Warrior
    Training Adventure, organized by Mankind Project https://www.mkp.org/

    It gave me a safe space to express my fears, my successes, my sadness,
    my true self.  Whatever I needed to say or express was welcome.  I
    stood shoulder to shoulder with men who were courageous enough to
    simply be there for one another, no matter what the circumstances.

    So now we are creating a small group in Tokyo, looking for a few men
    who are looking for authentic connection.  Based on my training and
    the book _A Circle of Men_ by Bill Kauth, we talk about &quot;real&quot;
    topics.

    Some recent questions included:

    &quot;What's the most difficult challenge coming up in your life?&quot;

    &quot;What's one thing you believe you should but are having trouble doing
    it?&quot;
    &quot;What's keeping you from doing it?&quot;

    We aren't there to &quot;fix&quot; people.  We don't give advice or tell you
    what you should do.  We simply give a safe place for you to get
    everything out, so *you* can look at it; so *you* can find your own
    best solution.  We hold each other accountable once we make a
    decision.

    Anyway, all of this requires trust and speaking honestly.  The word
    I've been using the describe it is &quot;Authenticity&quot;

    What if we were authentic with each other?  What if we could answer
    &quot;how was your day&quot; with &quot;I feel sad&quot; ... and for that to be okay?  No
    reason to *stop* feeling sad.  Just be sad and honor the emotion.
    Take a few minutes for yourself to just sit and feel sad.  I'll sit
    with you.
</code></pre>

<p>Question 2:</p>

<pre><code>If you are hearing that “you’re not good enough” voice, what does it say?
    No one cares what I want to say

Do you want to quiet that voice? Declare your intention now.
What’s your intention?
    I often find people who are interested in authentic sharing

How does that intention fit with your purpose for speaking?
    Many people will be touched + intrigued by the message and enjoy
    speaking authentically with others.

Who needs to hear your message?
    People who care enough to be honest with themselves and others

What voices would you like to hear instead? What do they say?
    Wow that's right!  I'm so thankful to have a safe space to speak.
    When does your group meet?

Who are 3 people that you’re going to have in your seats
with loving, compassionate, and supportive voices?
    J, T, M, S, P, L
