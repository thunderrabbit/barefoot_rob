<p>Dang.  I cannot seem to get Godot to detect collisions; I have some
phsyics bodies fixed on the screen but dragging other physics bodies
goes right through them.</p>

<p>Still working on our <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/">open source Godot game, ConSwi</a> (which I think is
the perfect name, my partners are both saying they want a longer name
that is more descriptive), I got piece dragging to follow the mouse
properly.  Originally I had the drag only active when the cursor was
over the piece, so if the mosue went too quickly, the piece would no
longer receive the input and lose track of the piece.</p>

<p>Now I have refactored the code that was used to catch what I called
&ldquo;Orphaned Swipes,&rdquo; meaning swipes that were released out in the play
field as opposed to exactly on the last piece.</p>

<p>OrphanSwipeCatcher is now GameSwipeDetector, and is now its own class,
which allowed me to move a decent amount of code out of Game.gd and
allowed drags to be detected even if the drag point moved off of the
piece being dragged.</p>

<p>This refactor is still in progress; there are some more functions
related to swipes and drags that can be moved to GameSwipeDetector.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Godot for dealing with memory management and
allowing my semi-noodled-code so I can focus on functionality of the
game.  I can imagine Travis&rsquo; shock when he reads that!</p>

Godot coding is lovely and fun in many ways.</p>

<p>Met Tariq to talk about next steps on our game.  My next step is to
see about having a backend we can talk to.  His next step is to design
the progression of levels and think about audio within the game.</p>

<p>I have had a few crashes in Godot in the over the past couple of days,
and each time it was due to using <code>queue_free()</code> (or apparently
misusing it).  I took them out in favor of <code>hide()</code> and <code>remove()</code>.
The crashes seem to have gone away.</p>

<p>I would like to extend my custom Godot class, but have not been able
to figure out how to do it.  I found</p>

<pre><code>extends &quot;classname.gd&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>But I want to extend the scene as well.  I will try a couple things,
but I am getting tired haha.</p>

<p>Yay my game in Godot knows the names of swipes that are swiped by the
player.  I need to expand the ShapeDatabase a bit more as I have
forgotten some basic ones, but they are all defined in one spot so
it&rsquo;s easy.</p>

<p>Conswi is my temporary name for this game we are working on.  It&rsquo;s a
fake name with Latin influence.  Fred has a couple days off and we may
work on it together (and play Minecraft).  He has been teaching C++,
so learning another language may be fun.  I like working with my bro.</p>
