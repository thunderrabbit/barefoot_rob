      <description>17:54 Tuesday 11 December 2018 JST Dang. I cannot seem to get Godot to detect collisions; I have some phsyics bodies fixed on the screen but dragging other physics bodies goes right through them.</description>

      <description>09:56 Sunday 09 December 2018 JST Still working on our open source Godot game, ConSwi (which I think is the perfect name, my partners are both saying they want a longer name that is more descriptive), I got piece dragging to follow the mouse properly. Originally I had the drag only active when the cursor was over the piece, so if the mosue went too quickly, the piece would no longer receive the input and lose track of the piece.</description>

      <description>22:34 Monday 07 May 2018 JST Thank you [Godot](); I wish I could open-source this, but suffice to say, Godot coding is lovely and fun in many ways.</description>

      <description>13:22 Monday 08 January 2018 JST Met Tariq to talk about next steps on our game. My next step is to see about having a backend we can talk to. His next step is to design the progression of levels and think about audio within the game.</description>

      <description>05:07 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 I have had a few crashes in Godot in the over the past couple of days, and each time it was due to using queue_free() (or apparently misusing it). I took them out in favor of hide() and remove(). The crashes seem to have gone away.
14:42 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 (44 minutes to Dubai) I would like to extend my custom Godot class, but have not been able to figure out how to do it.</description>

      <description>14:56 Thursday 28 December 2017 I refactored my code to remove an array which I thought was causing Godot to mismanage memory, but.. the error is still happening! It must be something with my code and not memory management. boo</description>

      <description>16:51 Tuesday 26 December 2017 -03 Yay my game in Godot knows the names of swipes that are swiped by the player. I need to expand the ShapeDatabase a bit more as I have forgotten some basic ones, but they are all defined in one spot so it&amp;rsquo;s easy.

Thank you Godot for making game dev simple!</description>

      <description>14:09 Sunday 24 December 2017 Conswi is my temporary name for this game we are working on. It&amp;rsquo;s a fake name with Latin influence. Fred has a couple days off and we may work on it together (and play Minecraft). He has been teaching C++, so learning another language may be fun. I like working with my bro.</description>

      <description>14:02 Sunday 24 December 2017 Godot is super great for fast and easy development. I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten to the export stage yet, but hopefully that will be as easy. I was able to add a queue to display the upcoming pieces in about an hour, including distractions.

      <description>8:46 Tuesday 19 December 2017 I finished what I&amp;rsquo;m calling v0.0.1.X of my Godot game. Now the pieces fall via gravity, can be moved via keypress, and can be dropped quickly to the bottom of the screen..</description>

      <description>07:44 Sunday 17 December 2017 -02 I am pressing forward with my little Godot project, Le Swipe, even though I have not done things like create pseudocode. I have just been hacking together https://github.com/RodZill4/godot_inventory and https://github.com/yichen0831/TetrisGodot
As of this, https://github.com/thunderrabbit/robdot_leswiz/tree/9d823291cc2df3dd98569eaf901b1bef0c818c2d I have this:</description>

      <description>23:13 Thursday 14 December 2017 I have an Area2D in Godot, with its Pickable value set ON.
I added a _on_Area2D_mouse_enter function, but it does not get triggered when the mouse hovers over the Area2D.
Interestingly, adding a _on_Control_mouse_enter function does work.
BUT, my _on_Control_input_event function does not work.

Yay! I started a new Godot project, basing its core on https://github.com/RodZill4/godot_inventory.git Now I have functions which respond to mouse clicks and mouse entry/exit.</description>

      <description>17:16 Tuesday 12 December 2017 JST I may be speaking too soon, but programming in Godot is so easy I could just cry. (in terms of memory managment, auto completion, and things just working)</description>

      <description>06:37 Sunday 12 November 2017 JST Godot Engine would display its windows at the wrong zoom level so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even use it&amp;hellip; so I was like bah at first, but so many people kept liking it, so I kept at it and discovered it was an issue with different monitor pixel densities. Aha! Looks like Godot is reading the pixel density on my main monitor even though it is open on a second monitor.</description>

      <description>05:46 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST Last night I decided to look at using Godot to develop our next game. I downloaded and opened it up, but it could not open the list of templates.
Operating system or device, Godot version:
OS X 10.12.6, Godot v2.1.4.stable.official
Issue description:
Run Godot first time, the Project Manager window appears, but cannot connect to sample templates.
Can&#39;t connect to host: https://godotengine.org/asset-library/api  Looks like the same as #7545, but on OS X instead of Windows</description>
