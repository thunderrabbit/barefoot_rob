      <description>My website stopped working recently. More accurately, Hugo stopped rendering the /blog and /journal portions of my website. The last time it worked was 2 weeks ago. I noticed that my local version of Hugo had gotten updated (*) and checked the releases.. sure enough there was a change to something related to that I had tweaked regarding indices.
The problem languished for a while until I remembered that Netlify allows choosing which version of Hugo to use.</description>

As of yesterday, I noticed that Netlify added &amp;ndash;recursive to their clone process.
Yay! I like to think it was because of my suggestion that they do it. If not, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty amazing timing! Thanks, Mathias!</description>

I got my repos sorted today; all the journal entries have had frontmatter lobotomies if Middleman can&amp;rsquo;t deal with the different dates, and my main Middleman repo includes the journal entry repo as a submodule.
However, turns out netlify doesn&amp;rsquo;t clone recursively (yet). I mentioned this to Mathias and he was like, &amp;ldquo;hmm you&amp;rsquo;re right&amp;rdquo; and said he would look into it. But, he said politely, he was planning to go home for the night and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to push any possibly-breaking changes before going to bed.</description>
