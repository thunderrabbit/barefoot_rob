      <description>12:01 Wednesday 19 December 2018 JST For over a year, I have had gaps in my schedule on Wednesdays between teaching at Solid Square in Kawasaki and teaching at JB in Kawsaki. Usually I bring my computer and work in a cafe, but today is the second time I have worked in an internet cafe, which features my own private space with a padded floor for sleeping, free wifi, free shower, free drinks, and free ice cream.</description>

I seem to have gotten over the jet lag (new vocabulary word for some students today). I was roused by a security guard when I tried to nap on a grassy field on 3F of Lazona (next to Eggs N Things (or something)).</description>
