<p>When I took the train this morning at 6:24am, it was running on time
no worries.  However, apparently trains started running late soon
thereafter.  One of my students happens to live near my same station
(新百合ヶ丘) and she said the trains were late, which caused her to
arrive late.  I am thankful for my policy of arriving 20+ minutes
early.</p>

on the train, with my computer in my lap.  I will put on my shoes once
I reach the building where the lesson is.</p>

The last train for me to get home tonight leaves at 9:23pm, but I was
able to get the 9:03pm train.  Yay!</p>

<p>I have taken to takin&rsquo; the super express train to work on Monday
mornings.  I get a guaranteed seat for a 20 minute snooze instead of
guaranteed standing room only for 30 minutes.  Only problem is the
schedule: I end up arriving 45 minutes early.</p>

<p>However, I have never been late to this class, given that I attempt to
arrive at least 20 minutes early.  On occassion, the trains are late,
and I like to not be late if at all possible.</p>

<p>Met R and B (Rhythm and Blues?)  B and R (Banana Republic?) in
Shinjuku today.  I hope I helped them get to Hakone easily and quickly
enough.  We rode the fastest train that would stop at my station on
its way to Odawara.</p>

<p>They have been studying in Taiwan, and came to Japan to check things
out.  They&rsquo;ve been to pretty much all the good spots on the metro map
of Tokyo.</p>

<p>B said an interesting thing that countries have had the right for
millenia to have standing armies to protect them.  Could be true, but
I wonder if it is necessary, and who benefits from having an army.</p>

<p>I invited them to read about
<a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=wtc7">WTC7</a> since they had not
heard three towers fell in NYC that day.</p>

<p>I took the KQ line from Shinagawa to YRP Nobi, and then back to
Kanazawa-hakkei, because I had loads of time between Paola&rsquo;s and work.
Still have loads of time, so I&rsquo;ll probably walk to Fukuura now.
Hopefully it won&rsquo;t rain!  (About 10 percent of people I can see now
are carrying umbrellas.)</p>

<p>On Keihin Tohoku line now approaching Oimachi.  Will arrive in
Kawasaki in about 12 minutes, at which point I&rsquo;ll go to Wired Cafe to
drink up some addictive internet, on which I plan to email Lin that
I&rsquo;m back, and look for a guy to fix my phone.  I&rsquo;m sure it can be
fixed; just the chargin&rsquo; parts are borked.</p>

<p>And maybe I&rsquo;ll try to find a toot for integrating Soomla into a Unity
app.  They seem to have all the right parts, but not yet so flush on
examples.</p>

<p>Sweet this Limited Express train is fun to ride as it whizzes past
like 7 stations between KQ Kawasaki and Yokohama (sorry, Travis).  I
might try to ride in the very front (passenger) seat next time.  It
features big windows to see out front.</p>

<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;ve never really liked riding trains from KQ Kawasaki;
there are several lines which use the same set of platforms so I can&rsquo;t
just jump on any train that comes by.  Plus the trains range from
local (and hit every station) to limited express (and skip most
stations), so even if I&rsquo;m on the right line, I might take &ldquo;forever&rdquo; to
get there or miss the station completely.  So I guess i&rsquo;m saying I
don&rsquo;t like it because I have to pay attention to what I&rsquo;m doing haahaah</p>
