<p>I slept on 南武 line from 登戸 to 川崎 station today.  Nice to get a
57 minute sleep on a 30 minute trip.  (The train sits in Noborito for
27 minutes before departing.)</p>

<p>Early morning lessons on Wednesday are back after the summer break.
I&rsquo;ve been teaching here for some years, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t mind&rdquo; if the lessons
were taken over by someone else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t mind&rdquo; in quotes because that was the phrase Eriko
doublechecked with me to be true regarding the lesson.</p>

<h5 id="09-46">09:46</h5>

<p>The lesson was fine today, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind coming back next week
(probably).  Ayano, Satoshi, Ai, and I talked about summer vacation
for a minute and then dove back into the book.  To help them be
involved in their own learning, I have taken to having them be
&ldquo;manager&rdquo; for various exercises in the text.  This helps me because I
might otherwise skip or dwell on something too difficult or easy for
them.</p>

<p class="dream">
One train came and slammed through the car on the tracks.  Another
train came on the adjacent tracks and slammed through the car on
those tracks.  A third train came through and I knew it must be a
dream so I threw the garbage of the KKK uniforms under the train and
watched it be carried away relentlessly by the wheels unstopping and
then noticed the train was not that long so they could see it was me
and I thought good thing it's a dream and then an old black man came
by laughing and we laughed our asses off as they train curved its way
slowly around the whole valley as I started to make up straight lies
"it took them then years to finish those tracks god bless the lives
that were lost falling down the valley" and visualized under water the
skeleton not there as the lie had been told and just fish who didn't
even know what a lie *was* much less that it had been told and didn't
affect their lives in any way.

<p>I&rsquo;m on a local train in Shinjuku which will leave in less than a
minute from now.  I could have taken an express train which would get
to our station faster, but would not have afforded me a seat to write.</p>

<p>I got a seat on my preferred train.  I arrived in just enough time,
though it&rsquo;s reasonable to say I could have ridden more slowly to be
safer (down the big-ass whooo-hooo hill).</p>

<p>I walked gently toward our station while repeating the lesson for
today.  I included &ldquo;I am determined to see time differently&rdquo; an was
intrigued as I walked past a man who was walking slowly; it felt right
/ fine to do so.</p>

<p>Arrived at the train station and just missed the local train, but
whatdya know the next train was a Hakone Limited Express (or
something) and the next stop is Shinjuku, and I got a seat (for 410 yen).</p>

<p>Tonight in Noborito station, I got off the train to try to figure out
which train would be fastest to my station. A woman saw me barefoot
and asked where I was going. She kindly looked up my station and
confirmed my hunch that the next train was fastest to Shin Yurigaoka.</p>

<p>While riding on the train together, she asked me why I was barefoot,
and then what I was doing in Japan.  I talked about my dream to reduce
the suicide rate in Japan, and she reflected on the gravity of the
situation.  She asked me what I thought it was the reason the Japanese
commit suicide, and I said is because I think some people are unable
to talk about serious topics and they end up feeling alone, with no
other way to solve whatever problem they are having.</p>

<p>The conversation was relatively short and sweet; it&rsquo;s only about 8
minutes to my stop.  When getting off the train, I had an urge to
offer a hug so I did, and she accepted.</p>

<p>It was a nice connection, and I wish I had had my business cards or
was thinking quickly enough to trade contact information.  Maybe this
entry will suffice.</p>

<p>This morning I woke up with a start in Noborito, where I transfer
between lines from Odakyu main line to JR Nambu line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh snap my stop!&rdquo; and bounced out of my seat, got off the train and
was confused about how far down the platform I was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I?  This is&hellip; ohhhh&hellip;&rdquo; and went back in the train and sat
back down in my seat.  (thankfully no one else took it!)</p>

<p>I had already transferred in Noborito, and had fallen asleep on the
Nambu line train which <em>starts</em> in Noborito.</p>

<p>After work today, Lin and I met at the station and as a little
&ldquo;romantic&rdquo; gift, I bought reserved seats so we could take Romance Car
to our station.  It was nice to just be able to relax all the way
home.  Curiously, when Lin tried to pay for my bus fare, it wouldn&rsquo;t
go through so the driver just let us on the bus free.  Yay!</p>

<p>I guess we should try to pay for each other&rsquo;s fare more often on the
bus, to help them get the bugs out of their system, and to get free
seats.</p>

<p>A local train leaves my station at 6:15 or so.  It takes 45 minutes to
get to Shinjuku.  It seems to always have all of its seats taken, but
today I found a seat in the very last car.  Only downside is I barely
have room to get out my computer, and I am currently typing with one
hand. There is dfinitely not enough room to have my elbows at my sides
and type with good posture.</p>

<h2 id="06-48-monday-13-november-2017-jst">06:48 Monday 13 November 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Ah here in Yoyogi-Uehara, most people got off the train and now I have
room on both sides for elbows.</p>

<p>Brrr but now I&rsquo;m cold.</p>

<p>Wow interesting! Today I thought I had completely missed the express
train to Shinjuku (non-stop from my station), misremembering that it
leaves at 6:14.  But it leaves at 6:21.</p>

<p>The train and I arrived at the station at the same time, but from past
experience, not only will all the seats be sold out, there will be a
queue of people hoping to buy tickets.  Today there was a queue of
people, but the tickets were still being sold! Wow so I got a ticket,
hopped on the train and zooom arriving in Shinjuku 20 minutes after
departure.</p>
