      <description>00:27 Saturday 24 March 2018 JST Lin&amp;rsquo;s mom just got home; she had been at the clinic cause her eye was all red. From her description to Lin, I don&amp;rsquo;t understand what we might call it in English, but apparently it happened today while she was at work. She was not able to see well and called a different number while trying to call Lin. Dr gave her some medicine and tomorrow she will stay home from work.</description>
