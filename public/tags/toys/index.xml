I went to the toy store today on the way to Funatsu&amp;rsquo;s exhibition. This time, I was able to solve two puzzles. Actually one&amp;rsquo;s not really a puzzle, but it&amp;rsquo;s just fiddly:

The other is a puzzle called Quattro Formaggi:

I went quite early to the toy store to see the latest toys, and the guy was like, [Today is Shibata&amp;rsquo;s day off.] I found a couple of cool maze toys, one of which I sort-kinda had in mind, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought to make it with wood. They&amp;rsquo;re selling it for about 6000 yen (either 5500 or 6500) which means it costs about 3000 to make.</description>

      <description>On the way to lesson with Mutsumi and Mutsumi, there&amp;rsquo;s a Lotus dealership. I used to have a Lotus, cough hotwheels cough, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t last more than a year, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll need another. But today I walked to that side of the street and took a picture of cars in the showroom.
Continued on that side of the street and found a cool toy shop! Sweet stuff including a very difficult marble track &amp;ldquo;puzzle&amp;rdquo; (not quite the right word) which I could make, given the right tools.</description>
