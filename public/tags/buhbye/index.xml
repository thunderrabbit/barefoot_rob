      <description>22:36 Tuesday 14 June 2016 JST Today after work at CB, I met Lin in Shinjuku to look at options for mobile wifi.
Went to a shop where blue eyed Lexy explained which phones were waterproof. Talking to the guy upstairs, though, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand why he kept saying that my 3G usage wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good way to estimate my future 4G usage, so we left.
Went across the street and looked briefly at a shop advertising Tokyo Free or something, but their prices were only for data, not voice, so we moved to the next shop.</description>
