<p>Ma and I chatted while waiting for Nico to arrive and clear customs.
Fun chatting with her and nearly finished solving the latest NYT
crossword puzzle.  I can see how it would be a good way to keep the
ol&rsquo; left brain sharp.</p>

<p>I chatted with the nice driver of the shuttle bus as she drove us to
the IAH parking lot a couple miles away from the airport.  I asked if
she could drive us to Sugarland (an hour away), and she said, &ldquo;just
let me get some gas first..&rdquo;  I love that quick wit!</p>

<p>Ma drove us to Sugarland via Google Maps and then drove us to the
grocery store 600 meters away before heading on her weekend adventure.</p>

<p>Nico and I bought food at the grocery and went through the self
checkout lanes and chatted with the clerk there who had no other
customers.  &ldquo;Are you busy??&rdquo; I jokingly asked her.  I asked her for
the codes on various produce I had bought, but all the items were to
be scanned!  I was like, &ldquo;you kids have it so easy!  When I was a boy
we had to memorize all the codes&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end, I was like, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the discount button?&rdquo; and she said
there wasn&rsquo;t one, but if I had a Kroger card, I would get a discount.
Sweet!  Aw man I should have used my card with Nico&rsquo;s checkout as
well; I don&rsquo;t think he got one.</p>

<p>On the way out of the parking lot, I said HI to a woman locking up a nail
salon shop.  I ran up to her, &ldquo;oh please just one more customer??&rdquo; and
she laughed saying she had just come back to get her back pack.</p>

<p>I love that I can banter with clerks here so easily.  Cannot often do
it in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Walked back to the house and now in my own room, with own adjacent bath!</p>

                        <p>Today is the second time for me to lead an eye gazing workshop.  This
will be in the same location in Dogenzaka.</p>

<p>It will be my first time to meet Yuna face to face!  We have been
doing lessons online for a while (since July 2018), so we know each
other pretty well, but we have never met!</p>

<p>Currently 4 people are scheduled to attend, which is better than the
Past Lives workshop!  I apparently need to do a better job promoting
next time. :-)</p>

<p>I went to a stand-up comedy open mic tonight and ended up doing a set
(my first ever!)</p>

<p>Several jokes went well, a couple did not; one of those is not
recoverable in any way I can think of.</p>

<p>Soness said it was really good that I used contents of the room for
several of my bits.</p>

<p>Until now, we have always had inkjet printers.  Our inkjet printer
ran out of ink <em>again</em>, and I was like ef this.  We are buying a
laser printer.</p>

<p>It arrived today.</p>

<p>It is thrice as heavy as the inkjet and ten times as fast, a lot more
crisp, and omg super great.</p>

<p>It scans like a champ (with its autofeeder that even worked with
somewhat not-flat pages).  This laser printer is lovely.</p>

<p>I just finished a two hour session with Dane Dormio, during which we
got a high level look at how I am doing in different areas of my life
versus how I want to be doing in those areas.  Then identified some
action and habit I can implement in the next week.</p>

<p>Action: clear space for new printer</p>

<p>Habit: continue exercises from A Course in Miracles</p>

<!-- State of my Life from that perspective (unfinished):

ENERGY

FOCUS

<p>Robert Golden and I enjoyed chatting at the onsen near Minami-tama
station on JR Nambu line.  Great to get to know each other better.  I
told him about how I ended up in Japan, including Tammy, Bonnie,
Wende, janette, Lin.  We talked about MKP Japan and the work we are
doing here.  I learned how he ended up in Hawaii.</p>

<p>I wished we could hang out longer at the onsen; I did not finish all
my lunch and did not finish sitting in all the pools + both saunas.
But chronos time calls and I am now headed to work at SCC.</p>

<p>Smartly, I brought dress clothes for work and am now clothed, dressed
smartly for work.</p>

<p>Hugged Robert bye on Nambu line in Noborito; he is headed to Hiroo,
and then leaving Japan tomorrow or Saturday.</p>

<p>I rode TJ Bike to the bicycle parking lot today.  This is the first
time I have done so for work, given that we got our bicycle parking
passes during Golden Week, and this is the first day that I have to
work outside the house.</p>

<p>I usually allow 24 minutes to walk leisurely to the station.  Riding
TJ Bike &ldquo;leisurely&rdquo; down a big hill, I arrived at the bicycle parking
area in 8 minutes.  Leisurely locking TJ Bike and walking to the train
took 6 minutes.  So it took 14 minutes from house door to train door.</p>
