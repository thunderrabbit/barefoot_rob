<p>(written 09:25 Wednesday 21 March 2018 JST)</p>

<p>In a single day, I can take maybe 20 or 30 frames, which adds a couple
of seconds to the final movie.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I worked 2 hours on Marble Track 3, including adding a new
dimension of planning to the project:</p>

<p>I wrote notes to script out the next 5 weeks (or so) for the
Reversable Guy (character whose head looks largely the same when
facing forward or backward) as he debugs why the stage is slowing
down.  For what I have sketched out so far, in final movie time, it
will be like (323-183) / 12 = approx 12 seconds of video.</p>

<p>The end of this video includes 2 seconds of footage which I sketched
out in this way.</p>

<h2 id="09-46-monday-12-march-2018-portland">09:46 Monday 12 March 2018 Portland</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.oregon.gov/olcc/marijuana/pages/default.aspx">Recreational marijuana is legal in Oregon.</a>
I took advantage of this fact last night and had a really overall
positive experience with several <em>experiencial</em> teachings I gained.</p>

<p>I am still a bit affected as I write this, sitting in the airport in
Portland, waiting for my flight back to Narita.</p>

<p>The most interesting aspect about the experience itself was the time
stretching.  For a few chrono minutes, I experienced one timeline in
reverse and another forward.  In the reverse timeline, it was like
causality was reversed.  I got out an umbrella so it started raining.
I had created the ampersand symbol so that I could try to &amp;help
myself out of this situation now. But that doesn&rsquo;t make sense because
if I did that, then I would have had to create computers, which would
mean I had to create electricity, therefore earth, therefore the
galaxy, all the way back to creating time.</p>

<p>I That was the bad part of trip; I was experiencing each choice I made
as the <em>wrong</em> choice, leading myself to having fallen into this
infinitely recursive spiraling infinity of loss, which happened at
every moment going forward, during which each moment had me
experiencing fear all the way from the beginning of time like watching
a car wreck in slow motion after having already lived it.  Each time
they went all the way back to the beginning of the universe in which I
created heaven and hell <em>so that</em> I could have the experience right
<em>now</em> of saying &ldquo;yes, you were right&rdquo; to the devil, &ldquo;you (Devil) <em>can</em>
do anything you want (including run time two directions at one), and
hell <em>is</em> real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The backwards timeline was both infinite and infinitesimal, with
infinities available at any given point, like focusing in at the numbers
in a number line.</p>

<pre><code>0  1
0  0.5   1
0  0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1
0  0.001 0.002 0.003 0.004 0.005 0.006 0.007 0.008 0.009 1
0  0.000001 0.000002 0.000003 0.000004 0.000005 0.000006 ...
</code></pre>

<p>My host became the devil and was smiling at me as he had trapped me.
Every decision I made including having come to this place was a trap
of his design.  I realized if every choice I made was the wrong
choice, I might as well do something good for something while I am at
it, so I started to pet Radar, my host&rsquo;s dog who gave me some kisses.
I kept petting Radar and the backwards timeline had less sway in my
thinking and that began to let me focus on the forward moving
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; timeline.</p>

<p>In that moment, I recognized that by focusing on fear (and feeling
sorry for myself) I went further into the reverse timeline where
everything was my fault, all leading to the ultimate stuck alone in
hell experience, repeatedly experiencing all-my-choices-are-wrong and
I-cannot-make-the-correct-choice.</p>

<p>So with that realization, I got my first experiencial <em>knowing</em>:</p>

<h3 id="1-focusing-on-loving-others-brings-me-out-of-pain">1) focusing on loving others brings me out of pain.</h3>

<p>My host led me to the guest bedroom by way of the restroom to brush my
teeth.  I was able to floss, but not brush.  I remember asking if I
had already brushed as I couldn&rsquo;t remember if I had.  I lay down on
the couch bed and started texting Jimmy, replying to his question from
a few days ago.  The convo below is paraphrased.  J is for Jimmy and
私 marks things I wrote:</p>

<h2 id="march-8th">March 8th</h2>

<p>J:  &ldquo;How was Portland?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="my-first-reply-mon-10pm">My first reply Mon 10pm:</h2>

<p>私: I am high as fuck</p>

<h2 id="22-22">22:22</h2>

<p>私: It&rsquo;s 22:22 now and I had crazy time dialation like rooms and centuries gone backward</p>

<p>Sorry have a good night</p>

<p>I am super high and time is going both backwards and forwards</p>

<p>With the devil on the forward side offering me good while he offered me bad with each reversing as I paid attention to the other timeline</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 22:25 and that took a small lifetime</p>

<h2 id="01-14">01:14</h2>

<p>私: Okay I got up and went to the bathroom. 01:14 now. Then I came back
and took shower. I bought the soap from the soap factory I had
established in the 1800s to cause world trade center to be destroyed
so I could meet the guy behind A&#38;E9&#47;11truth. Then I got busy with the
American revolution before the one that started in 1776. And now I am
sitting in the bathroom at 01:17</p>

<p>Or something like that kinda time was the delay before, like two or
three hours ago.</p>

<p>((( me now at 10:10am:   That was what I wrote, trying to capture an idea of the
time dialation experience, and I note I was relatively correct when I
said it was 2 or 3 hours ago.  )))</p>

<h2 id="01-18">01:18</h2>

<p>J: this was your dream? or time warp or whatever?</p>

<p>私: Yes, That was the size of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10000000</sub> of my dream</p>

<p>J: wild</p>

<p>私: One time was going backwards and one was going forwards. That was
a bad trip for a second, I was stuck in an illogic loop, but then
finally was able to think my way out.</p>

<p>((( me now at 10:15am Portland time Tuesday: What is kinda magnifying
the effect is my computer being set to Japan time (still) and my phone
being set to Portland time, and the chats only showing
<del>Portland</del> <ins>Japan</ins> time
as I write the in Portland time&hellip;  and as I try to figure out what to
write I still wrote the wrong geography for a second. )))</p>

<p>((( me now at 10:19am Portland time: at some point while I was texting
Jimmy, I had the second big realization+knowing, that feelings are
important. )))</p>

<h3 id="feelings-are-important">feelings are important</h3>

<p>Feelings help me distinguish between the right way to move forward and
the way I do not wish to move forward.  I knew this from before, but
this time I (think I) learned it more deeply.</p>

<h2 id="01-25">01:25</h2>

<p>私: And even now while I&rsquo;m typing, it is it while I&rsquo;m awake, that time is slowing down
But the one isn&rsquo;t going backwards anyone
At the long text I wrote two timestamps:</p>

<p>1:14 and 1;17</p>

<p>I felt it coming on (
Those timestamps, I mean, were accurate at the moment I wrote each
one.
) I felt the cold before because I had been outside helping my
(ghost) haha I typed host and my phone thought typed ghost</p>

<p>I had be outside helping my host with s can construction project when
my high hit</p>

<p>We were calculate the &hellip;.. Voice to text now:</p>

<h2 id="01-30">01:30</h2>

<p>私: We were calculating how much to cut a pole on the fence and the gate
because he had made a gate width with a fence posts that was a non
standard width according to the market</p>

<p>I meant to type though not so
Sometimes my phone doesn&rsquo;t respond to my touch and I think it&rsquo;s like normal I just has one of them weird now cuz I&rsquo;m having this experience
So the experience is no longer scary but for a minute it was scary</p>

<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t know how long the Minit was I kept repeating some things that were scary and they were proving the experience was real
I remember talking about water on the screen but not oil
But I had protected the bad trip on my current host and something like he was in on the bad trip as well
Which did the first trip I had just marked up is like my first trip
and who cares that it was bad</p>

<p>But then the district because link to it has a like a logical circumstances both of my house were in on it that really freaked me out for a bit
Because one time stream was going backwards and prove that this trip
number two caused for trip number one to happen</p>

<h2 id="01-33">01:33</h2>

<p>J: yup, youre high</p>

<p>私: And that post number two was therefore in on the same bad trip like he had been planning for it in from reverse and It Forward going through. Time stream
Some of the fucked-up text is because of this phone misinterpreting me
And it&rsquo;s too fiddly to use my finger to correct the text</p>

<h2 id="01-40">01:40</h2>

<p>(((( Here is the beginning of the next realization: ))))</p>

<p>私: My phone doesn&rsquo;t have enough charge to do video</p>

<p>(((( As I was connecting to Jimmy as a source of stability, I saw the
phone battery slowly dying.  I could not work out how to charge it and
was feeling really sad that I would not be able to connect with him
for a few infinities that I would experience between when the phone
died and my trip waned.</p>

<p>And that brought the next realization: change is good.  The fact that
my battery is inexorably heading in one direction (losing energy), it
proved to me that I was experiencing time in the correct direction,
albeit with infinities of interruptions, each infinitely long.  ))))</p>

<h2 id="02-42-tuesday-13-march-2018-jst">(((( 02:42 Tuesday 13 March 2018 JST ))))</h2>

<h2 id="10-42-monday-12-march-2018-portland">(((( 10:42 Monday 12 March 2018 Portland ))))</h2>

<p>In the aiport now, writing this entry for an hour now, I am going to
just slap down some of the other learnings, including the one I just
mentioned above</p>

<h3 id="change-is-good">Change is good</h3>

<h3 id="i-choose-my-focus">I choose my focus</h3>

<h3 id="my-focus-chooses-my-experience">My focus chooses my experience</h3>

<h3 id="i-can-make-the-right-choices">I can make the right choices</h3>

<h3 id="i-have-the-power-to-choose-at-each-and-every-moment">I have the power to choose at each and every moment</h3>

<p>These realizations kept coming more and more quickly, possibly
subjectively quickly, but I think objectively more quickly as well,
stacking up on each other like momentum of goodness.</p>

<p>Okay I am going to try to sleep for a bit.  Still a bit more than an
hour until boarding.</p>

<h2 id="16-04-tuesday-13-march-2018-jst">16:04 Tuesday 13 March 2018 JST</h2>

<p>Back in Tokyo, headed to men&rsquo;s group, all the time dialation effects
are worn off.</p>

<h2 id="16-46-sunday-13-may-2018-jst">16:46 Sunday 13 May 2018 JST</h2>

<p>Bunch of great guys here in Oregon for the LT1 and ST1 dual training.
I attended ST1 (Staff Training 1) in Perth last year and am attending
LT1 (Leadership Training 1) in Oregon this weekend.  Got to meet Alan
who I know from my online men&rsquo;s circle, and met Mike P with dredlocks
who I had met online as well.  Also met Richard and was like &ldquo;woah!&rdquo;
when I recognized I knew him from online.  Have not yet seen Scotty K,
who I also know from online, but I told him on Thursday that I&rsquo;d be
here and he said he might come down.</p>

<p>Sad news is that I am an idiot and did <em>not</em> tell Collenie Beanie that
I would be here, and I did not realize until she was like, &ldquo;wait,
which Portland?&rdquo; on FB that I had effed up.  I was so focused on just
the weekend that I did not tell anyone except the men here.  Colleen
said she would have driven down to see me!  Oh god I am such an idiot.
I will be back by next year though, so I will be hella sure to let her
know ahead of time!</p>

<p>Got the blessing of the community tonight before dinner and John H
started to fundraise a bit for me to help start MKP Japan.  He wrote
me a check which covers my flight over here.  Not sure how to cash it
though unless they have my bank in this area.  Talked to John for a
while tonight, and he seems to have a wide range of detailed info
about a wide range of historical, financial, naval, and medical
topics.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m leaving in about an hour for a weekend in Portland.  It&rsquo;s for a
training called <em>The Container of Leadership</em>.  I will be challenged
to look deeply at myself, really digging down into my -isms and other
thoughts which unconsiously underly my perception of the world.</p>

<pre><code>To pursue his dream of travel, Rob gave up his comfortable life in
Texas, including house, car, cat, and fiance. Just to see what
else is out there.

Fascinated with time, Rob has started a stop-motion animation
project, likely to take ten years.  He has also started writing a
novel, which is being presented backwards, one word at a time.

Walking around barefoot as often as possible, Rob hopes to inspire
others to do what they like, regardless of what other people may
think.

Not knowing what to do in life, Rob often prescribes to Bashar's
suggestion that people should do what excites them most at any
given moment.

At the current ongoing moment, that is organizing peer counseling
circles for men and women in Tokyo.  Growing from 3 men to 9 men
and 4 women in two years.

<p>Went to SOGO for workout with about 50 people in attendance.  Great
weather and great workout.  I met Shell, Koji, Tyler, and others, but
cannot remember now.</p>

<p>Went to lunch with Lisa at Laska and chatted with her a bit, and got
to see a video of the type of dancing she is doing.</p>

<p>Went down to Tsujido for karaoke after recording video at karaoke with
Kai, Mitsue, and Soness as the stars.  Got to see long-time-no-see
Yuji, and longer-time-no-see Jesse.  Plus got to meet all-time-no-see
Vesna.  Thanks to Soness for organizing and inviting, and giving me
some crazy sock-shoes!</p>

<p>Came back for lesson with Sarumama but got her cancellation request on
my way home.  She said she will pay for the lesson.</p>

<p>Walking toward home, I saw the guy next to the telescope stand I
sometimes see with or without a telescope.  This time he had his
telescope connected to a laptop which could see the image.  Much
easier to use than back in the day when we had to squat down and
squint up into the eyepiece.  He showed me a picture he had taken of a
nebula, which was apparently 120 snapshots overlaid on each other to
get sufficient brightness.  It looked quite good for such a small
telescope!  (3 inches or so)</p>

<p>My homework after my session with <a href="https://daerylholzer.com/">Daeryl</a>
is to look up hypnotherapy training.  She said I cannot finish reading
books because I get started reading, remember the rest, and don&rsquo;t need
to read the rest of the book.</p>

<p>Three hours of lessons in SCC today; looking forward to it!</p>

<p>On the way there, I hope to figure out why my local version of
mypowercircle.org will not compile with Hugo.  bah.  it was supposed
to be easy!!</p>

<p>Ah. I had gotten stuck trying to add Japanese language version of the
site, but never got it working.  It&rsquo;s better to just have an actual
Japanese speaker make the Japanese site, so I cut out the Japanese
content from the site and now it&rsquo;s working again.</p>

<p>Great lessons today with Miyako, Yuki (first lesson with her), Naoko,
Mizuho, Liliko, and Tomoe.</p>

<p>Often seen walking barefoot around Tokyo, Rob likes baring his soles
as well as his soul. &ldquo;The long term goal is to reduce the suicide rate
in Tokyo&rdquo; he says with a wistful gaze.  &ldquo;It just seems like such a
waste of human potential for someone to kill themselves instead of
talk about their problems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To facilitate talking about problems, he leads peer counseling circles
in Tokyo.  One is just for men using protocols from The Mankind
Project (mkp.org) The other is co-gender, because &ldquo;as far as I know,
nothing like this exists for women in Tokyo (and I can&rsquo;t join a
women&rsquo;s circle).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking about the value of emotional literacy and how it can
transform relationships of all varieties, Rob speaks from experience.
&ldquo;I met people from The Mankind Project in 1996.  I was delighted to
meet people who could be authentic and even vulnerable with one
another.  They seemed to relate to one another on a deeper level.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attending the New Warrior Training Adventure in 1997 was &ldquo;huge for
me.  It was the first time in my life I realized I was a man.  I was
27 at the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today was the first time I worked five hours at SCC.  Due to a
schedule snafu, 1.5 hours with Liliko chatting about her trip to
Sydney and my trip to OZ, then Rick and Morty and Lucifer.  I didn&rsquo;t
think of Dirk Gently, but she considered getting Netflix to see the
others.</p>
