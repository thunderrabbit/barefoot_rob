<p>I met Shraddhan in Iidabashi to hear about his Creative Capitalism
game.  I don&rsquo;t have a full sense of how to play it, but we had fun
playing a small version which resulted in six piles of 72 yen each,
plus a 5 yen coin in the center.</p>

<p>The idea is that these will be seed money for six different projects.</p>

<p>I chatted with Dora for 1.75 hours on the phone.  She had some amazing
insights on my presentation for MKP stuff.  Plus a course she has
enjoyed taking, designed to help people start their business projects.</p>

<p>While talking, I walked from Nishi-Azabu to the other end of Yoyogi
Park before realizing I had intended to turn right <em>before</em> Yoyogi
Park, or actually maybe even turn at Omotesando.  Anyway, it was all
good because I found an earthworm still alive on the sidewalk and
hopefully gave it another chance at living by placing it in the shade
under some leaves.</p>

<p>For some reason I believed I did not have any water to quench the
worm, but it turns out I <em>did</em> have water.  Weird.  It was pretty much
too late to go back and quench him by the time I realized it.</p>

<p>Neat to crisscross the city.  I walked across an intersection that I
had walked across perpendicularly many times.</p>

<p>On my way to SOGO there was a blue car amongst the stalls where people
were selling bread and beads and stuff.  Huh.  Old car looks new.  It
was old, and I asked the guy how old it was.  Older than me by 2 years.</p>

<p>After SOGO I talked to him (in English) for about 20 minutes, and met
his daughter, who has an accupuncture place nearby.  Neat!  Might go
sometime.</p>

<p>(written Monday 2pm)</p>

<p>SOGO was a lot easier for me this weekend probably because it was not
so blasting hot as it&rsquo;s been during the summer.  I was basically able
to do most of the exercises without giving up partway through as I
have done in the past.</p>

<p>After the workout, I joined a small group for lunch at a Thai
restaurant.  At my table: Asaad, Kino, Alex, Rafaela, Tatsuya, and
maybe someone else.</p>

<p>While heading back to Yoyogi Park, I was entertained that Rafaela saw
Dominique and someone going shopping so she was like, &ldquo;bye!&rdquo; to us and
bounced.</p>

<p>Back in Yoyogi, Masa was with Yo-T (sp), Leo, Pierre (?), and a couple
others doing some kinda game with jenga blocks.  Stacking the blocks
on people as a human sculpture.  Several different movement games
including Hand Dance While God Attacks, Animal Flow 3D, and the
finale: Dodge String.  We should have a video of that up soon; Masa
said he wants to edit the video before posting.</p>

<p>After that I headed deeper into Yoyogi Park to find Michael and Yuka&rsquo;s
party with lots of people, food, drinks, bubbles, and games.  I got to
meet Yuka&rsquo;s grandmother Hiroko, who could sit in 正座 like a champ.</p>

<p>Talked to Asaad more about his work in transportation engineering
(physics of bridges, tunnels, embankments, etc) and about men&rsquo;s
circle, including <a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/themenswork/">The Men&rsquo;s Work</a></p>

<p>Long time no see for Mike, and not-so-long no see for Brad, but I had
to ask their names again.  Re-met Haruna as well; will remember all
three in two weeks when I go back to SOGO!  Today Chihomi came and
said she enjoyed it enough to come back.  Today was also Kevin&rsquo;s first
day.  Kevin, beard freshly levin.</p>

<p>I met Dipendra today, a young man with design chops that far exceed my
own, and even Tariq&rsquo;s.  He is interested in doing the images for
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi">ConSwi, our swipe game</a> we
are making in Godot.</p>

<p>We met in a room that used to be a car showroom, but now features a
coffee shop because the car showroom was not making enough money.</p>

<p>I showed Dipendra how to get started with Godot and git.</p>

<p>Now headed home, but I will be back out tonight for Apocrypha, where I
will be telling my TJ Bike story of riding around Japan for 2 months.</p>

<p>Around 11am or so I hope to work on Marble Track 3.</p>

<p>Funny thing at SOGO today.  Sakura asked me how long I&rsquo;ve been in
Japan.</p>

<p>15 years.</p>

<p>She goes &ldquo;Wow, me too, almost.&rdquo;  She is 17 years old. hahaha</p>

<p>Wow <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> is great.  The compiler doesn&rsquo;t let you
fuck around too much.  &ldquo;Hey you&rsquo;re wasting variables!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Hey those are
different!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey you already did that!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t include it if you
don&rsquo;t need it!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use it if you didn&rsquo;t include it&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can imagine what Travis meant when he said if a <del>Hakyll</del> <ins>Haskell</ins> program
compiles, it probably works correctly.  Even with all the side effects
available in Go, I am <em>much</em> more confident that my code works than
with any PHP code.</p>

<p>Now I wanna rewrite my legacy PHP sites in Go.  Not gonna do it, but
the thought crossed my mind.</p>

<p>Anyway, in less than a day, I was able to create this TOML output file
that represents the data in Marble Track 3&rsquo;s YouTube account.</p>

<pre><code>[Videos]

    Duration = 0
</code></pre>

<p>The duration is 0 on all of them because
<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35170788">v3 of YouTube&rsquo;s API does not return durations</a>
when getting all videos in a list.  I will add code to get the
durations sooner than later, because the whole reason to do this is to
automatically have the total Livestream duration be updated on
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3 website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="00-00-saturday-01-september-2018-jst">00:00 Saturday 01 September 2018 JST</h2>

<p>Not bad for my first day messing around with Go.</p>

<p>A day later, I spruced it up some, including adding video types and
limiting superfluous calls to Youtube API.</p>

<p>Today I took the <a href="https://thepassiontest.com/">Passion Test</a> with Eri (, who
is still looking for participants, if you&rsquo;re interested).</p>

<p>I came up with the following visions and SMART goals</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Leading (by example) and teaching men to live their life mission</p>

<p>Have grandfathered 20 healthy men&rsquo;s circles in Japan that run
without me.</p></li>

<li><p>Creating passionate community around detailed art.</p>

<p>Have 50,000 followers online and 500 live watchers of my
livestreams</p></li>

<li><p>Loving relationship with Lin</p>

<p>I can drive her + visit Hawaii for 6 weeks at a time</p></li>

<li><p>Comfortable with my health</p>

<p>High energy / Dr says &ldquo;wow!&rdquo; when he sees my clearly healthy
medical test results</p></li>

<li><p>Comfortable in my neighborhood</p>

<p>I know 60 neighbors by name and we spend time together hanging
out.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Lin and I got off to a later start than I had originally planned, but
we walked an hour around our neighborhood, finding some new streets we
had never used before and arriving via different routes in places we
had been before.  &ldquo;Oh!  we&rsquo;re <em>here</em>!&rdquo; kinda thing.</p>

<p>Wow!  3.9km in 58 minutes, according to Google maps.</p>
