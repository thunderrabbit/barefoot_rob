<p>(names changed)</p>

<p>Hanako and Christy are over from Austin at Hanako&rsquo;s parents, who happen
to be our neighbors across the street.  Mom came over at 9pm or so and
was like, &ldquo;Rob!  come over!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After hugging Hanako and Christy I talked to them and ignored Hanako&rsquo;s
siblings who were there with family because I was in
new-people-overload (doesn&rsquo;t take much, I guess) and selfishly wanted
to talk to Americans.</p>

<p>Hanako has been in the US for a while.  We talked about their jobs,
which kinda overlap with Freds, though I couldn&rsquo;t get him on the
phone.</p>

<p>They went to fish market today and are going to Kyoto tomorrow.  I
might not see them again fo-eva because I&rsquo;ll be in Perth soon, and I
think they&rsquo;ll be gone before I get back, but it was great to talk a
bit!</p>

<p>Mom made great food, of which I had a little at their house, and Lin
and I nearly finished it at home (Lin arrived at 10:30pm from work)</p>

<p>Satomi said her friend Kenji liked to climb trees so we should all do
so!  Today was the day; we met in Yoyogi Park at 4pm.  At first it was
Satomi and Zakky, and then I showed up and we went into Yoyogi.  Kenji
and his wife Sherry (sp) came as well, and their friend Ozan lives
nearby so joined the fun. He said he wasn&rsquo;t good at climbing trees,
but we had fun playing badmitton and throwing a hard tennis ball at
velcro mitts.</p>

<p>After trees were climbed, we sat next to the pond, and after that,
Satomi and Zakky had to split so the rest of us went to an Italian
eatery near Ozan and Sachiko&rsquo;s place.  Sachiko joined during dinner
and showed us pics of the stuffed rabbit she&rsquo;s making for a project!
I introduced Francois and got a pic of him with Kenji and Sherry
(along with her squirrel-skin iphone cover).  Nice!</p>

<p>Wow cool!  I met a guy in Akihabara station as he was looking at the
train map. I happened to know he could get to Kichijoji station on the
Sobu Line so I walked him upstairs to it.</p>

<p>He described having been to an interesting sounding workshop thing,
and gave me a sticker from there.</p>

<pre><code>DMM.make
</code></pre>

<p>Wow what?  This DMM is the logo of an adult video company.  He was
like, &ldquo;wow yeah&rdquo; because apparently part of the presentation tonight
had been &ldquo;yeah DMM does AV but this isn&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lasse&rsquo;s cards are quite thick!  Like easily the thickness of 5 normal
cards.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll do the same with no amazeaweek cards, and carve a
maze into them.   Mmmmmaayyybe.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll certainly ask him if he can (suggest someone who can) redesign my
maze site.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I gotta make a maze!</p>

<p>Today was my first lesson in 赤羽橋, a station whose kanji I cannot
really read yet, though I know each kanji individually if I read
slowly.</p>

<p>The lesson is a beginner level lesson, though I think the article I
brought was a bit too difficult for the level.  I&rsquo;ll bring an easier
article next time.</p>

<p>Only two students: A on the left wearing a necklace made by her friend
ten years ago, and A on the right with all his mobile devices.</p>

<p>Another first lesson today: &lsquo;twas the first time I taught at Toshiba
science museum near Lazona in Kawasaki.</p>

<p>I taught three lessons to three individuals, all of whom wore the same
uniform, so I&rsquo;m not sure I could readily identify them in a lineup,
but the lessons were fun and I hope I will get to go back after
tomorrow, when I&rsquo;m scheduled to be there for three hours.</p>

<p>The lessons ran from 4pm and they ended promptly at 6pm so I made it
in plenty of time to M&amp;M lesson tonight.  I&rsquo;m at Mini Stop having my
customary vanilla ice cream cone.</p>

<p>Wow. Well, I survived the first day teaching a group of kids, they
seemed to have fun overall, and there was some semblence of learning
involved.</p>

<p>To be more specific, I just &ldquo;taught&rdquo; two classes of around 20 kids
each, the first group being a bit younger than the second; I&rsquo;d guess 5
and 6 years old, but I heard they were 4 and 5 years old respectively.</p>

<p>I know the second class had 21 kids, because we counted everyone twice.</p>

<p>Yuuji (from JB, who introduced me to this school) and I agreed the
second class was better; I did the vocabulary game in a big circle
instead of two lines, and I had them not touch the cards, but just
point to the requested card.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mutsumi&rsquo;s friend Bruno, I had one song ready, to the tune of
<em>Frère Jacques</em>:</p>

<pre><code>walking walking
walking walking
hop hop hop
hop hop hop
running running running
running running running
now we stop
now we stop
</code></pre>

<p>We did some variants of that (flying, swimming, driving, riding
bicycle, walking backwards), usually not to the tune of anything but
pandemonium. :-)</p>

<p>Okay so it all started ten years ago.  I made Marble Track 2 during my
free time at work and then made this video.</p>


<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlUqu6QE7bw" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>


<p>People asked how I made the marble track.  It&rsquo;s a simple question
without a simple answer.  &ldquo;I glued sticks together..&rdquo;</p>

<p>I decided I should answer by showing the pipe cleaner characters
making the track.  So this set of videos (which will eventually be one
video) will answer the question about how to make the track.</p>
