<p>I got my urbit planet running the other day on my local machine.
After some playing around I determined that I should be able to run it
on AWS on a t2.micro which fits within their free tier.</p>

<p>Marble Track 3 is not my #1 priority; I am happy to work on it slowly.</p>

<p>*) Rewriting in Gatsby / React makes sense if I can learn along the
 path to creating it.  How do you feel about going slowly, to help an
 old newbie learn along the way?</p>

<p>Basically, I do the work, learning along the way, you get a per
month retainer, for minimum 5 months?</p>

<p>*) What income streams do you see for Marble Track 3?</p>

<p>*) I got a gatsby-driven blog skeleton going, but have not integrated
Airtable.</p>

<p>*) I ain&rsquo;t sold on Airtable yet; I was not even able to get a Hello
World working after 35 minutes of poking around at existing templates
and staring at the interface</p>

<p>*) currently I have scripts that make different image sizes (2 for
now, but more can be easily added)  Where do images get stored in your
setup?</p>

<p>A man named Fust has recommended a new stack for Marble Track 3:
Airtable as backend, Gatsby as frontend, and some other things I have
not heard of.  Actually I had not heard of Gatsby.</p>

<p>I have an old VirtualBox sitting around so I spun it up and loaded a
Gatsby demo.  It pooped out a bunch of deprecation warnings, so I am
loathe to really dig into this thing if it will be an ongoing battle
against a bunch of deprecations ongoing during the project, as well as
making the marble track itself.</p>

<pre><code>Dear Rob,


Glad to see you email. I have gone through the website and there
are a lot of improvement which can be done. Please check one of
our Hugo based website - https://www.nathanaherne.com – If you’ll
see on Home page – we have shown important section of the site
briefly and with pictures. Same I’ll propose for this website
i.e. we can show 3 or 6 Workers with Images, 3-6 Tracks, One Step
with picture.


Also, the concept of the site is totally different and unique – we
need to put few lines to let the visitors understand what the site
is all about. We need to create a good logo as well. Regarding
Support/Donations, we need to create multiple ‘Call to Action’s to
take the visitors to the support page.


Do let me know your thoughts on my initial comments and do let me
know if you are available for a video call on 3rd or 4th Jan? My
Skype id is sanjay.deligence



Thanks &amp; Regards,

Sanjay Kumar | CEO

Deligence Technologies - your growing technology partner

<p>My replies, (poorly formatted here on my site):</p>

<pre><code>HI Sanjay

Thank you for your email.  I am glad you looked at the same
carefully enough to know it is a completely unique project.  I
agree with the changes you have suggested so far.

Here are some more sections of the site I would like to be considered:

Episodes
There is one more set of pages you should see as well.  https://www.marbletrack3.com/episode/   This page is hidden from normal visitors.  I would like the design of this page to match the rest of the site, but I do not want the page to be linked from the menus.

Episodes are driven with the file at
https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/data/playlists/knownvideos.toml
This file is updated with calls to Youtube API, driven by this
script https://github.com/marbletracks/go-get-video-durations

I am very happy with the way this all works.  I only want to
redesign the /episodes page to match the rest of the site.

Parts / Workers Did you see how these pages are linked between
Workers and Tracks?  For example,
https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/caret_splitter_feeder_extension/
source code includes an array of Workers that worked on the track.
There will be many many more tracks to come, and I eventually need
a way to allow human fans/supporters of the project to suggest
names of parts.

Thanks There will eventually be many more pages available under
https://www.marbletrack3.com/thanks/ There are no pictures of
people here yet, but this section is to thank the people who have
helped me with the track.  The Sweets Party Attendants have helped
me with translations.  Two more people have helped financially,
but I do not have images / permission to show them on the site.  I
would like a page under /thanks/ to be for this general support.

Steps Under &quot;Step by Step&quot; https://www.marbletrack3.com/snippets/
my idea is not nearly finished.  If you click the first Step you
see this page,
https://www.marbletrack3.com/snippets/0010_setting_the_stage/ The
Step is a detailed description of the first video snippet in this
playlist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KjsYc4Mb5g&amp;list=PL0osPGt21FB48UwuhtCUoi9JndC9YDHAZ

In order to drive this part of the site, I want to create a data
file similar to

I have sketched out a file at

<pre><code>but I have not written a way to parse it nor easily populate it.
There is no way to automatically create this data file, so I need to
have a reliable way to manually add new sections to it.

I would like for each written Step to be linked to the
corresponding second of output video.

This line

0:32 &quot;candy_mama&quot; | Snake Plate Chopstick for now, will create
text on the site for Snake Plate Chopstick and link it to second
32 of the correct video https://youtu.be/2bP7Irt5hHc?t=32

I imagine this is a mini-project of its own, so I do not mind if
we do not work on it.  But I am open to questions, ideas, and
suggestions for it.

In General For this project

I would like all work to be done in the open with Pull Requests on
Github.  I want all changes to work with my current workflow: when
I git push changes to the site, they appear on the live site via
Netlify.  I understand you do not have access to my Netlify
account.  But I hope once I merge a pull request, it will work
that way.  We can start with small changes to make sure it works
in a way that is good for both of us.

<pre><code>HI Sanjay

I have just realized I sent my email before speaking about
https://www.nathanaherne.com/

You said &quot;we have shown important section of the site briefly and with
pictures.&quot;  Instead of pictures, I want to use video clips like the
ones I have at the bottom of my existing
site. https://b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/workers/snippets/quick_look_francois_installs_stage.mp4

The overall idea on Nathan's site is good, but Marble Track 3 site
must focus on the workers and not focus on me as doing the work.  I
will be semi-hidden from the project, only visible on /episodes and
git repository.


thank you
Rob

<p>There is a morning exercise routine used by Japan to help build
community and health and prepare everyone for the day.  Even though it
has been used in Japan for a minute, it has not spread outside Japan.</p>

<p>Today after SOGO, Menya and Risa led us through the first stages of
changing all that.  They had multiple cameras and awesome music.
Video is coming Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mark rode 4km from the 古民家公園 to our house yesterday to meet Lin
and see Marble Track 3 in person.  He had some great ideas for MT3:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encourage teambuilding among youth by giving them a certain set of
track pieces, tools, and time limit to make a track that fits a
certain set of requirements.</li>
<li>Set my camera so the whole set is in focus.</li>
<li>Add narration or speech bubbles to explain the story in more detail.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today I met with Tariq and Dipendra to talk about ConSwi.  They are
all excited about the graphics and I am in the camp of getting a
minimum viable product out. I want to empower Dipendra to update the
graphics in the app.  He got a copy of Conswi from Github.  Instead of
giving him write access to the app, I had him create his own account
and push to his own ConSwi.</p>

<p>Although it is a fork, I assume it is not counted as a fork from
Github&rsquo;s point of view.  I wonder if that is possible to make happen.
Probably not if it has not been implemented already.</p>

<p>Dang it is 5:30 and already dark.  I remember our 5pm picture in Sao
Paolo was like noon here.</p>
