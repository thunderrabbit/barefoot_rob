<p>I just finished having my stomach checked. It was different than I expected. They put some kind of anesthetic in my mouth which for a moment maybe not be able to swallow which was weird. I couldn&rsquo;t breathe through my mouth.</p>

<p>It was a little frightening that I couldn&rsquo;t breathe through my mouth, but I was able to breathe through my nose so I was able to maintain and calm demeanor.</p>

<p>Now the operation is over and I am holding a cotton swab over the place where they dripped 500ml of yellow liquid into my veins so I can have some energy, since I have not eaten since 4 pm yesterday or 16 hours since the operation. Although it was requested that I don&rsquo;t eat for 12 hours before, timing didn&rsquo;t work work out so that I can eat</p>

<p>After my mouth was numb they put a camera tube thing down my throat. I was able to see in the monitor so that was somewhat interesting but I couldn&rsquo;t really identify a anything except weirdly shaped to sue and maybe like looking in a cave or some kind of monster.</p>

<p>I wish I could have gotten the whole video, but it&rsquo;s probably the same as any other person just probably online somewhere.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard from the doctor but I guess it&rsquo;s healthy. After the operation I fell asleep for a little bit. I keep saying operation but it was I&rsquo;m just a procedure not an operation. the place where they put the thing into my arm it&rsquo;s a little bit painful but not too bad. I&rsquo;m holding this thing for 5 minutes and I guess it&rsquo;s almost done but it still hurts.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to get up.  9:45</p>

<p>I have decided to wake up at 5am each day, and on the five days I do not
have to immediately go to work (for which I have already been waking
up at 5am), I will go for a brisk walk around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Today I went up the hill and along the ridge and up left on a street I
had never walked before, then up a hill into a park and then omg down
a spooky mossy staircase with spiderweb strands hitting my face and
cicadas buzzing my ears and mosquitoes chomping my legs.   Upon arrival
at the bottom, I turned left onto a little street and met Mr Kasahara
who was like, &ldquo;can I show you?&rdquo; and I was like &ldquo;please!&rdquo; and he showed
me a rainbow colored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysochroa_fulgidissima"><ruby><rb>玉虫</rb><rt>たまむし</rt></ruby>
insect he called a <em>tamamushi</em></a>,
and went on at length about how it was such a rare find.  I was able
to understand about 50% of what he was saying.</p>

<p>The area where he lived used to be named Kasahara, but the Odawara
clan(?) came over and Mr Kasahara had to flee (for his life).  He is
85 years old, and apparently has a fair few stories to tell.  I hope
to see him tomorrow and bring my recorder to record some of his
stories for science and study etc.</p>

<p>Tonight in Noborito station, I got off the train to try to figure out
which train would be fastest to my station. A woman saw me barefoot
and asked where I was going. She kindly looked up my station and
confirmed my hunch that the next train was fastest to Shin Yurigaoka.</p>

<p>While riding on the train together, she asked me why I was barefoot,
and then what I was doing in Japan.  I talked about my dream to reduce
the suicide rate in Japan, and she reflected on the gravity of the
situation.  She asked me what I thought it was the reason the Japanese
commit suicide, and I said is because I think some people are unable
to talk about serious topics and they end up feeling alone, with no
other way to solve whatever problem they are having.</p>

<p>The conversation was relatively short and sweet; it&rsquo;s only about 8
minutes to my stop.  When getting off the train, I had an urge to
offer a hug so I did, and she accepted.</p>

<p>It was a nice connection, and I wish I had had my business cards or
was thinking quickly enough to trade contact information.  Maybe this
entry will suffice.</p>

geocache and hid it.</p>

<p><a href="https://geocaching.com">https://geocaching.com</a>で登録したけど、まだハンネイしていない。I
registered it on <a href="https://geocaching.com">https://geocaching.com</a>, but it hasn&rsquo;t been published

<p>先輩は新しキャッシュを確認してハンネイします。 Some senior member will
check it and then publish the cache online.</p>

<p>I <del>plan to</del> place<ins>d</ins> my first geocache today.</p>

<p>I got support from
<a href="https://www.geocaching.com/p/default.aspx?guid=fdfa20d1-f3e5-4316-beb1-69d1cebbaa3f">Turbo-7</a>,
who sent me links to
<a href="https://www.geocaching.com/play/hide/en-us/small-note">English</a> and
<a href="https://www.geocaching.com/play/hide/ja-jp/small-note">Japanese</a>
notes to place on the cache.</p>

<p>I tweaked the notes to include my email address, but have not put them
online yet because they break the CSS of my site when displayed in the
index, and I cannot figure out how to override the Hugo index the way
I want.</p>

<p><del>I plan to create a (repo with a) page for (each of) my geocache(s),
and am working on that now.</del></p>

<p><del>I plan for it to be available at <a href="https://robnugen.com/geocaching/xxxx">https://robnugen.com/geocaching/xxxx</a>
where xxxx is the code given to me by Geocaching website once I place
the cache.</del>  For now, my domain is prefixed with new, so it will likely
be at <a href="https://new.robnugen.com/geocaching/">https://new.robnugen.com/geocaching/</a> and then the code.</p>

<p>I did not keep careful track, but I believe we had 15 men in Tokyo
men&rsquo;s circle (Integration group) last night.  According to <em>A Circle
of Men</em> we should think about splitting the group if the group is
larger than about 12 men.</p>

<p>I wonder about splitting the circle into two groups on the same
evenings, or possible begin a circle on another evening of the week.</p>

<p>Keith Corrigan contacted me on FB, and I thought it was a fake account
trying to lure money out of me, but now I am not so sure.  I still
have a guess that is the case, but it&rsquo;s not as blatant as others I

<p>I spent a couple hours on MT3 yesterday, culminating in introducing a
new character whose job is to carry marbles onto the stage.  On his
way out, he hit the switch to reverse the stage rotation, so
Squarehead will fall because he is <em>just</em> about to jump off the stage
onto the ramp, but the stage is just about to reverse direction.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s friend Aki joined SOGO today and had a lot of fun!  Lin may
attend as well next week; Aki plans to go again.  Yay!</p>

<p>I got a bit sunburned, but should not be too bad tomorrow.</p>
