<p>I got a weird bump on my leg.  Doctor gave some antibiotics.</p>

<p>Today is my first health update my journal.  I&rsquo;m actually writing via
voice recognition because I am not supposed to use my left wrist right
now.</p>

<p>I went to the clinic and the doctor took x-rays and said there is some
calcification on the bones in my wrist.  Here are some pictures.</p>

<p>Last night Yuji looked at my wrist at Shake Shack, He said he thinks
my good posture with my back and shoulders this actually hurting my
wrist, Which ends up taking all the stress.  He also said it seems
like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distal_radioulnar_articulation">joint between my radius and ulna</a> is not as strong as most
people.</p>

<p>He gave me some exercises to help strengthen the joint and kind of
get it back into the right position.</p>

<p>SOGO is 2 years old today, so the organizers suggested a picnic in
Yoyogi after the workout.  Great workout and picnic with maybe 100
peeps and 80 peeps in attendance, respectively.  I chatted with Hide,
who has come for quite a while, and some first timers, Kino, Anna, and
Laurie.  Actually I don&rsquo;t know if it was Kino&rsquo;s first time, but it was
my first time to meet her.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m typing now, I think I might have sprained my thumb.  While
walking earlier, I could definitely feel a strain in my ankle.  Good
times.</p>

<p>oops it is tomorrow already, but today Lin and I had neighbors Richard
and Mai over for lunch, and then went for a walk with them and Fitz.
We found a geocache.</p>

<p><a href="https://coord.info/GLVJHGHK">https://coord.info/GLVJHGHK</a></p>

<p>I got a sharp flake of plastic splintered into my foot on the way
home.  Thankfully Lin was able to get it out relatively easily.</p>

<p>Today was the last day for
<a href="https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/">Build Your Speaker Bio</a> course;
I will miss everyone and am really thankful for how much Soness helped
with my speaker sheet.</p>

<p>Lin joined me today as I found my
<a href="https://coord.info/GLVF178K">first geocache</a></p>

<p>I want to place my own cache, but the site suggests finding between 20
and 100 caches before placing my own.  Bah.  I guess I will find a
couple others before I place one.  But the other crummy thing is the
place I wanted to place a cache is apparently too close to the cache I
found.</p>

<p>Today while I was in the cafe below Muza, a woman came up and asked if
I could speak English.  I drew her a map to a bank on the other side
of the station, but had a slightly bad feeling about sending her on a
possible wild goose chase.  Her name is Dipika, and she&rsquo;s been in
Japan just a little bit and will be here for 2 more weeks.  She didn&rsquo;t
exchange currency at the airport so she had no yen to buy a ticket,
and they don&rsquo;t take credit cards.  She&rsquo;s interested in finance, and
asked me my thoughts on Bitcoin once I told her I did computer stuff.</p>

<p>She said she&rsquo;s interested in China for the financial possibilities,
and I definitely agree; it seems Chinese economy is on the rise.</p>

<p>Anyway, I walked with her to the bank &hellip;. and discovered only ATM
machines were there.  She needed to talk to a person.  I misremembered
what street had her bank so we walked to the wrong street for a
different bank and then we were like bah and just went to Shinagawa
station where she could exchange her voucher to get her JR Rail pass.</p>

<p>The staff there spoke English enough to help her find a mobile wifi
provider, so we went there and got her hooked up with wifi for two
weeks.  Once she got some cash exchanged in Shinagawa, she paid me
back for the train ticket to Shinagawa from Kawasaki.  I gave her the
money back in exchange for updates during her adventures.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping Dipika has a great trip!</p>

<p>Nice synchronicity brought two old friends together on the train just
in time for one to invite the other two men&rsquo;s group last night, the
first Tuesday of the month, when new men are welcome to join.</p>

<p>Six men in the circle last night.  Good strong container in which we
did a lot of good work.</p>

<p>While walking from Roppongi down to my lunchtime lesson, I walked past
a woman (after admiring her tattoo), and then she walked past me and
said, &ldquo;hey I like your style,&rdquo; referring to my bare feet.  Turns out
she works at <a href="https://gonpachi.jp/?page_id=22">Gonpachi</a>,
<a href="https://thecitylane.com/tokyo-gonpachi-aka-kill-bill-restaurant/">aka the Kill Bill restaurant</a>.
She invited me to come by, so I did around 1:45pm.</p>

<p>She must have been busy or the message did not get to her, but no
Nono.  I left her a note; I hope that gets to her.  I forgot to draw a
bare foot on it.</p>

<p>Okay, Nono, your turn!  Check out the co-gender group which meets on
Monday nights 7pm - 9pm very close to the restaurant!</p>

<p><a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/">https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/</a>   This is written for the <em>men&rsquo;s</em>
circle, but the
