      <description>19:27 Friday 11 August 2017 JST Oh XCode, you&amp;rsquo;re so quirky.
You automatically change Images.xcassets, automatically add the changes to git, AND automatically restore the changes after I revert them. This might be helpful if you did not also refuse to build the app due to missing images. I hate building iOS apps. Utterly shit experience all the fucking time.
Why do sandboxed users have to have difficult passwords? I don&amp;rsquo;t mind good passwords for real users, but not for sandboxed users.</description>

      <description>16:23 Wednesday 16 December 2015 JST OKay so I have a lot of audio files in XCode for the project we&amp;rsquo;re making. They are recordings of words for pronunciation practice.
I needed to add some more files for &amp;ldquo;similar words,&amp;rdquo; two of which ended up being the same words as the original words.
XCode lets me drag files in from Finder and index them into the project. So I dragged in 120 files andddd I get an amazing error message like, &amp;ldquo;one or more errors occurred while importing files&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>23:40 Tuesday 13 October 2015 JST Bah. It seems I cannot submit an osTV app to TestFlight without having an Apple TV device connected to my computer. I hope that&amp;rsquo;s a bug, not an attempt to sell more devices. Bah.</description>

Why why why oh why oh why why oh why
Why do all the iOS 7.1 simulators get destroyed when I install Xcode 6? Why is there not a way to delete all the ones that don&amp;rsquo;t work in one shot? Why does the UI require like 4 clicks all over the place to create even a single simulator? Why does the simulator creation allow me to create unlimited identical simulators?</description>
