      <description>12:05AM Christmas Day, 1991
(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)
The zoo was cool. We went to every exhibit, except that I noticed we did not see girraffes. The reptiles were cool. This will all be written haphazardly, since I want to write about what just happened. At the zoo, we saw a huge ass green moray. It was in a tank with a nurse shark and a lemon shark.</description>
