Honored to be invited to the event! AdmiredÂ that Rin has connected lots of people who could easily become friends.
Upon arrival, Rin cried as Hiro predicted. Everyone had a great time. I friended Chris just because he commented on the FB group.
Talked to him about PB 49 and 52, assuring him I could talk about it all night (even though 13 years at wow)</description>

      <description>Wednesday 5 March 1997
(transcribed out of my diary)
 Sunday night Wende and I drove to Denton to harass Fred in class Monday.  We played 2 versions of the Alphabet Game (*) and had wonderful conversation on the way up there. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what we talked about, but it was great.  Once we got there, I essentially fell asleep immediately after we got back from shopping for milk, OJ &amp;amp; pizza.</description>
