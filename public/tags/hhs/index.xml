      <description>12:00 Monday 02 January 2017 JST John Gaughan suggested I run Head Heart and Soul workshops in Tokyo in order to invite more people to do the type of personal growth work we do in my men&amp;rsquo;s group.
I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished porting from PDF to Google Drive their notes, which Soness and I will use to prepare for presenting the workshop.</description>

      <description>12:57 Monday 07 November 2016 JST Soness and I got on Zoom with Russell who recently led a Head Heart and Soul workshop, and basically walked us through the idea. It looks like it will be quite fun and eye-opening for us and others who attend!</description>

      <description>17:48 Sunday 16 October 2016 AWST  Okay, so we&amp;rsquo;re going to do some Head Heart ans Soul workshops in Tokyo. John said he&amp;rsquo;ll send me the protocol, and I&amp;rsquo;ll show it to Rohini; I think (hope!) she&amp;rsquo;ll be really into the idea. We&amp;rsquo;ll run a few of those, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll contact Ken who said he&amp;rsquo;ll come out for a PIT if we have 20 participants.
 Shadow Work workshops that John and Rhonda lead may also be good.</description>
