(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)
I was beaten soundly by Mr Bandecca 4 or 5 games in a row. I kinda felt bad, since he had commented about how he wanted a workout, not to just piss around.. He was very nice about it, and I believe sincere when he said he enjoyed playing. That&amp;rsquo;s cool.
Last night I got a call from Cheri, who said she was going out with some guy who&amp;rsquo;s 31, apparently a real charmer, he&amp;rsquo;s made comments about her nice blonde hair &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;good proportions&amp;rdquo; and commented that he&amp;rsquo;d like to take pictures of her.</description>
