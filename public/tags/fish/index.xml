      <description>06:32 Thursday 30 August 2018 JST I heard some water trickling and noticed a fountain flowing into a basin made of bricks. There were a couple fish inside, effectively making it a brick fishtank.

The sky was overcast so not too hot.
Oh, today was the day I walked across part of the dirt lot and up into the back corner area. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think to take pics while on the inside, but I might go again.</description>
