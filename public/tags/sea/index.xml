      <description>21:00 Wednesday 13 March 2019 JST 05:00 Wednesday 13 March 2019 PDT I am on the non-infamous Delta flight 166 from Narita to Seattle on which nothing of consequence happened&amp;hellip;. except I got a Bailey&amp;rsquo;s Irish Cream because it had the word cream in it and I thought I might like it.
It&amp;rsquo;s good!
I watched Christopher Robin movie which was cute. I considered watching Bohemian Rhapsody again but my first viewing last month or so caused the music to rattle around in my head for weeks afterward, and it is even back now as I write about it.</description>
