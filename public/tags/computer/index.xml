      <description>Last night when I finally went to sleep around 11 pm my brain was pounding headachey and my eyes were vibrating in a strange way like, not in a good way.
I chalk it up to too much time spent on my computer.
it kept me awake for a while, but I was finally able to calm myself down into sleep.
I&amp;rsquo;m on my way to the dentist now, recording this with voice transcription.</description>

      <description>30 January 1999
A few days ago, my machine locked up and then wouldn&amp;rsquo;t reboot. It would try to boot, but where the boot manager would normally prompt with
 LILO: 
so I could type in whether I wanted to boot linux or Windows, now it just said
 LI 
and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do nothin.
Hmmm.. I was able to boot with a floppy, and even (thankfully) read all the info on this otherwise unbootable hard drive.</description>
