This is from Dude, regarding the possibility of creating a black hole with with the LHC. I agree:
This supercollider is the one that was going to be built in Waxahachie, Texas before he Republican Congress dubbed the &amp;ldquo;Republican Revolution&amp;rdquo; came into power in 1994. This work could have been done in the United States. Instead, we have outsourced our place as the leader of innovation and cutting-edge science to other countries that do not spend over half of their annual budget on making military contractors rich.</description>
