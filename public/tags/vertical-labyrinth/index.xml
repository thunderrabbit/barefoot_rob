      <description>05:20 Monday 20 August 2018 JST Lin and I walked together yesterday on a completely new route.
I chose not to go to SOGO after flipping a coin after Lin asked if I wanted to stay at home and install the vertical labyrinth game.</description>

      <description>22:20 Sunday 19 August 2018 JST A couple of years ago I received a vertical labyrinth game from the toy store I used to frequent in Harajuku on the way to my lesson with Sarumama.
In the past couple of days I decided to mount the game on our wall so we can actually play with it!
Here is the game resting on a shelf, where any decent sized earthquake could send it toppling to disaster.</description>
