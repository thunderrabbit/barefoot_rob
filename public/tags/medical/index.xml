      <description>9:31 Friday 17 August 2018 JST I just finished having my stomach checked. It was different than I expected. They put some kind of anesthetic in my mouth which for a moment maybe not be able to swallow which was weird. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t breathe through my mouth.
It was a little frightening that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t breathe through my mouth, but I was able to breathe through my nose so I was able to maintain and calm demeanor.</description>
