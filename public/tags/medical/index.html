<h5 id="9-31-friday-17-august-2018-jst">9:31 Friday 17 August 2018 JST</h5>

<p>I just finished having my stomach checked. It was different than I expected. They put some kind of anesthetic in my mouth which for a moment maybe not be able to swallow which was weird. I couldn&rsquo;t breathe through my mouth.</p>

<p>It was a little frightening that I couldn&rsquo;t breathe through my mouth, but I was able to breathe through my nose so I was able to maintain and calm demeanor.</p>

<p>Now the operation is over and I am holding a cotton swab over the place where they dripped 500ml of yellow liquid into my veins so I can have some energy, since I have not eaten since 4 pm yesterday or 16 hours since the operation. Although it was requested that I don&rsquo;t eat for 12 hours before, timing didn&rsquo;t work work out so that I can eat</p>

<p>After my mouth was numb they put a camera tube thing down my throat. I was able to see in the monitor so that was somewhat interesting but I couldn&rsquo;t really identify a anything except weirdly shaped to sue and maybe like looking in a cave or some kind of monster.</p>

<p>I wish I could have gotten the whole video, but it&rsquo;s probably the same as any other person just probably online somewhere.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard from the doctor but I guess it&rsquo;s healthy. After the operation I fell asleep for a little bit. I keep saying operation but it was I&rsquo;m just a procedure not an operation. the place where they put the thing into my arm it&rsquo;s a little bit painful but not too bad. I&rsquo;m holding this thing for 5 minutes and I guess it&rsquo;s almost done but it still hurts.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to get up.  9:45</p>
