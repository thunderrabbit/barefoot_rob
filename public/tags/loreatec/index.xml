      <description>10:34 Sunday 14 April 2019 JST I am on the way back from Loreatec with another new battery in my computer. I replaced it back in December or so, but it never really acted right. Hopefully this one will do the right things.
Lantz offered this battery at no cost after I tried to pay him. We settled on half price.
10:40 Sunday 14 April 2019 JST Battery has gone from 36 to 31 percent in a few minutes.</description>
