Lin and I have been talking a lot about her plan to live/work in Thailand for a year.
Being apart for an extended time will be hard; I know! I see it as an extension of our relationship into a new realm. What&amp;rsquo;s it like to be together and be apart for a decent bit of time?
Lin has &amp;ldquo;always&amp;rdquo; wanted to travel and see other parts of the world.</description>

encouraging others to find their own spiritual path, and speaking out against social injustice.
3. When do you feel most Unitarian Universalist?
