<p>Lin and I have been talking a lot about her plan to live/work in Thailand for a year.</p>

<p>Being apart for an extended time will be hard; I know!  I see it as an extension of our relationship into a new realm.  What&rsquo;s it like to be together and be apart for a decent bit of time?</p>

<p>Lin has &ldquo;always&rdquo; wanted to travel and see other parts of the world.  That&rsquo;s exactly how I came to Japan, and gave up a whole life with great friends and great Wende to do it.   Even when I found another great life with janette, I was like, &ldquo;yeah, no&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t settle here, all the way up in Dallas, when the original goal was <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> way around the world.   When janette dropped me off at the airport, it didn&rsquo;t hit me until I went through the gate.  Boom crying like a baby &ldquo;what the hell am I doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got on the airplane having never been to Japan, hardly knowing the language (still don&rsquo;t, considering how long I&rsquo;ve been here.  Sorry, old Rob), and I remember how fucking hard it was to have no physical contact once I got here.  I got trolly comments on my journal when I was just wanting a hug.</p>

<p>So, I know it will be challenging, and I also know it will be growth.  For both of us, but especially for Lin.  She&rsquo;s wanted to travel for years but hasn&rsquo;t; she&rsquo;s been taking care of her family over taking care of her own dreams.   It will be growth for me and my desire for hugs.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll buy a (few) FREE HUGS t-shirt(s) to wear around town.   Maybe I&rsquo;ll spend more time in meditation to activate my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini">kundalini</a>, instead of having all this energy in lower chakras.</p>

<p>I think of the whole experience as divine spiritual growth for each of us and both of us together.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve mentioned, but the first time I washed Lin&rsquo;s back, I had a brief experience of déjà vu, &ldquo;wow; Lin and I have done this before!&rdquo; So I know we&rsquo;ve had at least one other incarnation together, and I suppose many many many incarnations together.  In this one, while we&rsquo;re deeply in love, we are planning to be physically apart for a bit.</p>

<p>My part includes maintaining my job and this apartment where Lin can come back anytime.  Her part includes releasing everything so she can live alone for the first time in her life.</p>

<p>I got up this morning thinking I should get some Thai flash cards for Lin, so I&rsquo;ll look for some now.</p>

<p><strong>1. How do you know you&rsquo;re a Unitarian Universalist?</strong></p>

<p>Raised UU, but I more often say I was &ldquo;raised UU&rdquo; than I say I am currently UU.</p>

<p><strong>2. How do you define Unitarian Universalism?</strong></p>

<p>encouraging others to find their own spiritual path, and speaking out against social injustice.</p>

<p><strong>3. When do you feel most Unitarian Universalist?</strong></p>

<p>age 5 to 20-something</p>

<p><strong>4. If you could design your ideal UU religious community what would congregational life look like? Who&rsquo;s there? What do they do after worship? What does worship look like? When does the congregation meet? Where does the congregation meet? Think even bigger than my questions!</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve filled out everything on the survey and am coming back to this question, with my answer to the bigger question.</p>

<p>I grew up as a UU. I remember being a kid lighting candles at the altar and all that. I became a teenager in 1983, just as LRY had been reborn in YRUU. I went to between 3 and 7 Rallies in Southwest District every year, and there were between 15 and 50 kids at each event. (Rallies are called Cons in other districts.)</p>

<p>I attended rallies until my first year of university; rallies didn&rsquo;t <em>literally</em> save my life, but they saved my sanity; I generally disliked the normal high school experience, except for rallies; they were my safe place to open up. They gave me real spiritual growth.</p>

<p>I have attended several (two hundred?) Sunday UU sermons in my life, but never really really really really liked them. It&rsquo;s just a bunch of intellectual blah blah through which I have gained very little spiritual content / support.</p>

<p>When I graduated from university, I remembered I hadn&rsquo;t been to church in 7 years. I went back and quickly gravitated to being a YRUU advisor; I wanted to give back to the organization that had given so much to me.</p>

<p>For about 5 or 6 years I was advising at church every Sunday locally and advising at every rally within the district; I was on youth council for a year; my number one focus was YRUU. I helped the youth organize Houston Rally about 4 times from 1998 to 2002 I think.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>YRUU is the closest experience I&rsquo;ve had to what I believe is spiritual truth: we are all one. Worship services where we each light a candle, say a few words, and then just BE together. Just sit. Just relax in a puppy pile. You are safe. You are loved. The entire universe is this moment right now. Need to cry? Just cry; we are here for you. Need to shout? Let&rsquo;s all shout; we are here together.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, the &ldquo;adult&rdquo; sermons are better for those who did not grow up UU. I&rsquo;ve seen many adult escapees from other religions say &ldquo;ah yes; this is more like it,&rdquo; when they come to a UU service. As opposed to where they were raised, the messages at UU services are like, You won&rsquo;t go to hell for breaking the rules; the love is all around you; don&rsquo;t worry be happy.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great! Those are great messages, but they&rsquo;re only partway to the reality that YRUUers experience at YRUU events. (Note, I say &ldquo;experience&rdquo; at YRUU events, not just &ldquo;discuss&rdquo; or consider in a sermon.)</p>

<p>In a YRUU event, the message isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t go to hell for breaking the rules&rdquo; but the experience is &ldquo;here we are in heaven already, creating this moment together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The message is not &ldquo;love is all around you,&rdquo; but an experience of &ldquo;you are loved; you ARE love; we are loved; we love and respect ourselves and each other&rdquo;</p>

<p>The message is not &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry; be happy,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s an experience of omg I&rsquo;m so happy I forgot to be worried!</p>

<p>When crappy stuff happens in YRUU, the community is quick to respond with love, &ldquo;yo, that wasn&rsquo;t cool, but we love you; <em>you</em> are cool and don&rsquo;t have to do that to get attention.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Rallies had grown to minimum 50 kids at an event to upwards of 200 at a single weekend event when I was an advisor. Unfortunately, around the same time I moved to Japan, there were some JNP-powered campaigns to castrate Southwest District YRUU of its power. These campaigns have largely worked; all the good advisors were pushed out (according to my former-YRUU sources) and YRUU events in Southwest District have been severely limited in quantity and quality.</p>

<p>SO, I don&rsquo;t know if any of what I wrote (YRUU is great) still applies, but I sorta feel like I graduated from UUism via YRUU; adult sermons can&rsquo;t really give me any more than I&rsquo;ve already got.</p>

<p>It ain&rsquo;t UUism&rsquo;s fault; people who weren&rsquo;t raised UU may not be ready for spontaneous puppy piles.</p>
