      <description>20:41 Thursday 17 January 2019 JST TL;DR: https://www.gofundme.com/launching-mankind-project-operations-in-japan
Just to confirm it is really me, I am posting a first person version of the ManKind Project Japan GoFundme campaign &amp;ldquo;Launching ManKind Project Operations in Japan&amp;ldquo; text here on my journal:
ManKind Project challenges each man to find and develop his own life’s mission, and to live that mission fully with the support of a powerful network. ManKind Project has become a global phenomenon.</description>

      <description>21:54 Wednesday 16 January 2019 JST The GoFundme text is not finished yet, but I plan to finish it up tonight or tomorrow.
It took a while to get this version complete, including breaking a pen and crying my eyes out with Mark at the Jonathan&amp;rsquo;s near 向ヶ 丘遊園駅むこうがおかゆうえんえき mukogaokayuen station.
Between working for TY and AB, I got this version complete in one take, after about 30 takes over a period of a week or so.</description>
