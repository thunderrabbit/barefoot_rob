      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard the quote something like
Insanity is repeating the same thing and expecting a different result.  I just realized that I have been trying to apply that quote too strongly in my life. I have low-key assumed I have to make some huge radical change in my life in order to have anything different.
That belief was blocking my ability to make lasting change. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to take on a huge change or multiple changes all at once.</description>
