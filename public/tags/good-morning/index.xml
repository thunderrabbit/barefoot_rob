      <description>This morning during meditation I realized I can do Meetups anywhere in the world. Why limit myself to just Tokyo?
Why not lead an eye gazing workshop in Hawaii while I&amp;rsquo;m there?
I am going to go for a walk; I wonder what time the local store opens. Probably 7am.</description>

He chilled out and then actually did not instantly fly away when he was able to.</description>
