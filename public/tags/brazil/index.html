<p>Actually, tomorrow is our last full day, but some of it will be spent
flying to Sao Paulo.  Our flight to Dubai leaves at 1am Sunday

play rummy.  I had never played before.</p>

most men have checked out.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t find my glasses during a quick walk along the beach near where I
lost them.   We did find breakfast buffet quite lovely, and I can make
do with Lin&rsquo;s glasses.</p>

<p>Headed to the airport now to fly to Presidente Prudente via Sao Paulo
(to see our friends R&amp;D).</p>

<p>Lin and I just walked along the beach from the restaurante de
churrascos (sp) after pretty much gorging on all the offerings.</p>

<p>I saw some really neat rivulets on the beach (but forgot to take a
picture) where water seems to just spring from the beach.  I guess
that is exactly what&rsquo;s happening; water within the sand works its way
out and then comes down to the ocean.</p>

<p>Great view of semi-fragile sand dunes, but not safe to climb ざんねん.
Hot girls including one with braces.  OMG why do so many adults have
braces here?</p>

<p>Finished algorithm for the app (LeSwipe / ConSwi) to deal with linking
swipes to shapes while chilling in a self made hole in the beach.</p>

<p>(pictures coming soon?)</p>

<p>Quite interesting to see the waves coming in over the very-flat beach,
so it came up significantly farther and farther with each passing unit
of time.  There was a bridge from the steps to the shore but even it
did not stay dry at high tide.</p>

<p>Before taking video of kids leaping from the restaurant balcony into
high tide, I took several pics of the water coming in, which I hope to
make into an animation.</p>

<h2 id="22-18pm">22:18pm</h2>

<p>wow so much to see in Brazil!</p>

<p>Played table football with Artulio(sp) as sister whined or watched
videos.  He never cared that I never understood, and he never tried to
understand when I spoke verbally.</p>

<p>At the end I threw a peace sign and he gently corrected me with throat
slit pantomime.  I guess it is serious bzns.</p>

<p>Relaxing on the beach, we got some delicious drinks: <em>manga con leche</em>
(sp) for me and acerola for Lin.  Mine was sweeet and <em>muito
deliciouso</em> (sp).</p>

<p>A man came by with a young boy in his arms, and we ended up giving him
R10 $3. Then other guys selling shirts, cashews, art, and maybe one
more before we ended up just leaving instead of saying no no no no.</p>

<p>En route to GRU via taxi from Rodrigo&rsquo;s aparment.  I trust we are on
time; our flight is at 12:45pm and the airport is apparently 14
kilometers from here.  Traffic has started moving briskly; we are
traveling at 80 km/h, so we should ostensibly arrive in less than 14
minutes, so I guess we are good.  It&rsquo;s a domestic flight so maybe less
stringent through security.</p>

<h2 id="10-47-tuesday-19-december-2017-02">10:47 Tuesday 19 December 2017 -02</h2>

<p>Now traveling 120 km/h so I am sure we will be fine.</p>

<h2 id="13-16-tuesday-19-december-2017-02">13:16 Tuesday 19 December 2017 -02</h2>

<p>We made it to the gate right at boarding time.  The taxi ride to the
airport was fine, but then we had to wait in line for 30 minutes to
pay extra for a big bag full of presents and stuff.</p>

<p>Rodrigo got the days mixed up so was not at the airport to meet us as
planned, but helped us by estimating the taxi price; it&rsquo;s 75% of the
cash we have handy, but we can make it!</p>
