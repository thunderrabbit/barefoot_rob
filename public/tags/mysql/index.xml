      <description>15:12 Wednesday 28 December 2016 JST I&amp;rsquo;m considering asking this question on stackoverflow or another stackexchange site.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got a mysql table of widgets. The widget table has about 80,000 rows and 100 columns.
My client has an index page where they can see a list of widgets. They can filter and sort the list arbitrarily. Pagination on the list works fine.
When a widget needs to have its data edited, user clicks the row and is taken to a widget edit page, which includes buttons to go to previous and next widget in the list.</description>

      <description>##11:20 Thursday 30 October 2014##
I&amp;rsquo;m not ready likely to file a bug report, but I had to change a field to UNSIGNED before I could use it in a math operation that resulted in a negative value.
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t trying to store a negative value, just
WHERE 2014 - field &amp;gt; 0
The field was unsigned smallint with value 2015.</description>
