      <description>(adapted from my note last night to Mark)
I went to a stand-up comedy open mic tonight and ended up doing a set (my first ever!)
Several jokes went well, a couple did not; one of those is not recoverable in any way I can think of.
Soness said it was really good that I used contents of the room for several of my bits.
