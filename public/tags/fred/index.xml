      <description>18:02 Monday 25 March 2019 CST We went to Hopscotch, which had interactive exhibits and a ball pit. A ball pit!! Fred and I did a skit for Peter&amp;rsquo;s birthday, alternately falling down into the ball pit and looking for the one who had fallen.
Sandra batted balls back as we threw them to her. We swam along the bottom of the pool, which featured LED flooring. Lotta lotta fun.</description>

      <description>14:09 Sunday 24 December 2017 Conswi is my temporary name for this game we are working on. It&amp;rsquo;s a fake name with Latin influence. Fred has a couple days off and we may work on it together (and play Minecraft). He has been teaching C++, so learning another language may be fun. I like working with my bro.</description>

      <description>17:52 Thursday 28 January 2016 CST Fred depounded his car and parked it outside the crappy gate where they said he can park it for 24 hours until we can get two licensed drivers to come get it and drive the other car back. Now, Lin and I are at Fred&amp;rsquo;s house while Fred takes a shower before his presentation tonight.</description>

      <description>16:46 Wednesday 09 December 2015 JST Showed him some vids I had uploaded of the things I was about to see: Seaside Line construction and Seaside Line itself. The giant post hole digger has two halves which are welded together to ensure they stay together during their operation. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t the repeated welding process eventually make the surface unweldable or at least unwieldy?</description>

Today while reviewing the world I set up for Fred, I found a note I left for him 1 year ago, to the day.

In other news, I made an underwater glass tunnel</description>

Rob: Right. Except that one you mentioned 41 years ago before you lost your memory of previous lifetime.
Fred: Good thing you remembered!
Rob: but I forgot to write it down!
Fred: the internet remembers!
And now, that we had this chat, it does.</description>

Fred and I video chatted for four plus hours while at our respective offices. I finished a maze-on-postcard for a guy on Fiverr, and then read the recent AMA by Snowden and crew, and acted as a rubberduck for Fred while he got some code (closer to) compiled.</description>

We determined that (at the time of our chat), it was about T-minus 100 hours until we&amp;rsquo;d get to hang out.Â I&amp;rsquo;ve got a stopwatch set; it&amp;rsquo;s been running 3 hours and 8 minutes now.
I told him I was thinking of getting him some &amp;ldquo;dope-ass chopsticks,&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;ceramic katana&amp;rdquo; so it would go through security as a carry-on.</description>

 -----Original Message----- From: Fred Sent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 11:02 PM To: Rob Subject: $1.51/gal $1.65 per gallon is the cheapest I&#39;ve ever seen gas here in Cali. The Silicon Valley currently leads the nation at just over two bucks. I rejoice when I see anything in the 1.80&#39;s. And summer isn&#39;t even here yet.  </description>

      <description>5x5x5 cube
In this email, 5x5 and 4x4 refer to &amp;ldquo;Rubik&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; cubes of size 5x5x5 and 4x4x4 respectively.
 From: Fred Nugen 04:00 Subject: 5x5 reduced to 4x4 (hopefully) To: thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom G - My initial assertion about solving the 5x5 is now valid. I have solved it down to the point of needing to switch two side edge pieces (as opposed to a center edge piece), as in: c se ce se c c: corner or center se cc cs cc se se: side edge ce cs c cs ce ce: center edge se cc cs cc se cc: center corner c se ce se c cs: center side This was the same place I was stuck at on the 4x4, only now I have to find a solution that preserves the center stripes as well as the rest of the cube.</description>

G -
It&amp;rsquo;s becoming more apparent that I could greatly benefit from having a bike here on campus. Campus is 2-3 times bigger than that of UH&amp;rsquo;s, and I have to walk quite a bit to get from my dorm (thankfully not situated along the perimiter of campus) to the engineering building (about a 12-minute walk across the center of campus) or the math building (about 4-5 minutes away from the eng building, and 8-10 from my dorm) or the place where I eat dinner (about 7-9 minutes away from my dorm, 15-17 minutes from the eng building, and 18-20 minutes from the math building).</description>

Fred is my brother, 4.25 years younger than I. We call one another G. He calls me G and himself g, except in this letter.

 G - Georgia was pretty cool, and so is Brandie! We went to Six Flags (she didn&#39;t ride any rides) and went to a park around there. The rides were fairly cool; however, the new Batman ride wasn&#39;t as cool as I had expected.</description>

      <description>Wednesday 5 March 1997
(transcribed out of my diary)
 Sunday night Wende and I drove to Denton to harass Fred in class Monday.  We played 2 versions of the Alphabet Game (*) and had wonderful conversation on the way up there. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what we talked about, but it was great.  Once we got there, I essentially fell asleep immediately after we got back from shopping for milk, OJ &amp;amp; pizza.</description>

      <description>12:05AM Christmas Day, 1991
(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)
The zoo was cool. We went to every exhibit, except that I noticed we did not see girraffes. The reptiles were cool. This will all be written haphazardly, since I want to write about what just happened. At the zoo, we saw a huge ass green moray. It was in a tank with a nurse shark and a lemon shark.</description>
