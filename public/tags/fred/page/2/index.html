<p>Fred and I video chatted for four plus hours while at our respective
offices.  I finished a maze-on-postcard for a guy on Fiverr, and then
read the recent
<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn/">AMA by Snowden and crew</a>,
and acted as a rubberduck for Fred while he got some code (closer to)
compiled.</p>

<p>We determined that (at the time of our chat), it was about T-minus 100 hours until we&rsquo;d get to hang out.  I&rsquo;ve got a stopwatch set; it&rsquo;s been running 3 hours and 8 minutes now.</p>

<p>I told him I was thinking of getting him some &ldquo;dope-ass chopsticks,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;ceramic katana&rdquo; so it would go through security as a carry-on.</p>

$1.65 per gallon is the cheapest I've ever seen gas here in Cali.  The
Silicon Valley currently leads the nation at just over two bucks.  I
rejoice when I see anything in the 1.80's.  And summer isn't even here
yet.

Subject:  5x5 reduced to 4x4 (hopefully)
     To:  thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom

G -

My initial assertion about solving the 5x5 is now valid.  I have
solved it down to the point of needing to switch two side edge pieces
(as opposed to a center edge piece), as in:

c  se ce se  c      c: corner or center
se cc cs cc se     se: side edge
ce cs  c cs ce     ce: center edge
se cc cs cc se     cc: center corner 
c  se ce se  c     cs: center side

This was the same place I was stuck at on the 4x4, only now I have to
find a solution that preserves the center stripes as well as the rest
of the cube.  That additional constraint shouldn't be so hard to get
around, though.

So I really am only one trick away from solving the 5x5, though that
trick is a hard trick which I'm not likely to figure out any time
soon. (Uh, well, it may be more like two tricks: I may have to
position them, and then orient them.)  Obviously, once I've gotten it,
I'll've also solved the 4x4.  At that point, it's off to the 6x6 and
7x7.  Though I don't expect to find physical versions, there's a nice
java app at <a href="https://www.tdb.uu.se/~karl">https://www.tdb.uu.se/~karl</a> I could expand to simulate
them.

Let me know when you've figured out how to get the 3x3 center squares
solved, and I'll tell you how to put the edges together.  Or, if you
like, I'll let you figure it out for yourself.

All right, time for lunch.

Subject:  not gettin&rsquo; a bike
To:       thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom</p>

<p>G -</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s becoming more apparent that I could greatly benefit from having a
bike here on campus.  Campus is 2-3 times bigger than that of UH&rsquo;s, and
I have to walk quite a bit to get from my dorm (thankfully not situated
along the perimiter of campus) to the engineering building (about a
12-minute walk across the center of campus) or the math building (about
4-5 minutes away from the eng building, and 8-10 from my dorm) or the
place where I eat dinner (about 7-9 minutes away from my dorm, 15-17
minutes from the eng building, and 18-20 minutes from the math building).
(Now draw a map.  Assume every path is a line segment; assume my walking
speed is a constant small enough that the curvature of the earth and
topography of ground level are negligible.)</p>

<p>I had wanted to get a BMX bike I could do tricks on like I see some of the
neighborhood kids doing occasionally: hopping up onto two-foot benches,
hopping up onto them so that they land&ndash;stopped&ndash;on their back tire
perched on the corner of the thing and then bounce once or twice before
hopping backward off it again; hopping up, riding along the bench, then
flipping a 180 off the other end, riding backwards&ndash;and pedaling
backwards, just for effect; flatfoot bunnyhopping sideways up onto the
bench; fuckin&rsquo; cool stuff.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t have time to teach myself those tricks.  I need something
cool that won&rsquo;t fall by the wayside: a unicycle.  Not a single one have I
seen yet.  There&rsquo;re characters riding all kinds of shit: bikes, concept
bikes, rollerblades, normal skateboards, big ol&rsquo; long skateboards, tiny
two-wheeled contraptions that are crosses between skateboards and
scooters, but no unicycles.  That will all change.</p>

<p>Hopefully it won&rsquo;t take long to learn to ride.</p>

<p>Gotta go.  It&rsquo;s time to get back to work.</p>

G -

Georgia was pretty cool, and so is Brandie!  We went to Six Flags (she
didn't ride any rides) and went to a park around there.   The rides
were fairly cool; however, the new Batman ride wasn't as cool as I had
expected.  Don't get me wrong, it was pretty cool, but the line was
two hours, and I liked the Georgia Scorcher better.  I also rode
Viper, which has five (count 'em, 5) inversions and was really quite
cool, especially considering that it wasn't made by B&M or Vekoma.
(It was probably Arrow Dynamics.)  I didn't get any pictures, as I
left my cameras in the car.  That's okay, though, since I'll be
spending 2-3 months in Georgia this summer.  I talked to one of the
guys there, and he really really me to work with him because of my
math background.  I told him that I had decided on attending Stanford,
but that I'd love to work with him in the summer, and he accepted!  

So I'm gonna finish my thesis in record time, and be off to Georgia
shortly thereafter.  That puts some constraints on when I can go to
Six Flags (over Texas) and Astroworld, but opens up the possibility--
no, the eventuality-- that I'll go to Busch Gardens and Paramount's
King's Dominion in Virginia.  I may also go to Boston for Memorial Day
weekend with some friends here.  Fucked up, huh?  

Well, I've got to get to work.

<p><p class=note>(transcribed out of my diary)</p>
<p>
Sunday night Wende and I drove to Denton to harass Fred in class Monday.
<p>
We played 2 versions of the Alphabet Game (*) and had wonderful conversation on the way up there.  I don&rsquo;t remember what we talked about, but it was great.
<p>
Once we got there, I essentially fell asleep immediately after we got back from shopping for milk, OJ &amp; pizza.  I ate one slice then slept.
<p>
Woke up and went to Fred&rsquo;s class.  Tamara was all nervous that it wouldn&rsquo;t work just right.  It was perfect.  I sat in the back with some dudes.  Test day and one of them was all, &ldquo;you gonna take the test?&rdquo;  <br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just gonna put some bullshit down.&rdquo;<br>
He&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;oh.&rdquo;<br>
I know he wanted to get answers from me.
<p>
Test was pretty easy pre-algebra.  I solved for 5 in (3x - 4) / (2x - 5) = (4x - 3) / 5 or something, and I drew a picture on the page.
<p>
The bonus was &ldquo;describe how to solve inequalities using absolute values.&rdquo;  I wrote, &ldquo;absolute values such as absolute love or absolute compassion for one&rsquo;s fellow man would solve all racial inequalities.&rdquo;
<p>
When class was doen, Fred went to his class and Wende graded the exams and I surfed and walked around campus.  When Fred was done, me Wende, G, Tamara all played frisbee and ran around and went to the Flying Tomato and harassed the guy behind the counter.  The girl behind the counter had amazing blue eyes and smile.
<p>
Went to a store filled with books and bells and crystals and drums and positive energy and all sorts of cool stuff.  Wende bought a cute wiggly toe ring and I enjoyed a $350 drum for a while.
<p>
Drove Fred&rsquo;s car a bit during that time and then went to the park.  They had a cool-ass swing set thing..  The top portion would spin!  We spun the girls who were sitting and screaming and Wende got sick to her stomach.  We got &lsquo;em going &lsquo;round pretty fast and pretty high.
<p>
Climbed all over a bridge-connected slide set and made up a game where you couldn&rsquo;t switch walls easily no tag people not on your wall. It was a crazy game.
<p>
We lay on the sidewalk to rest and talk.
<p>
Went back to Tamara&rsquo;s.
<p>
Slept from 5pm to 7pm and then drove home.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p><p>The zoo was cool.  We went to every exhibit, except that I noticed
we did not see girraffes.  The reptiles were cool.  This will all be
written haphazardly, since I want to write about what just happened.
At the zoo, we saw a huge ass <em>green moray</em>.  It was in a tank
with a nurse shark and a lemon shark.  We saw some huge ass snakes,
too.  We saw the gorilla do this (on his back the entire time): Long
slow lazy scratches on his belly, scratching toward his crotch,
flipped his back legs up by his ears, long slow scratches from chest
to crotch.</p>

<p><p>We saw lions doing weird stuff.  (I think one was in heat and the
others were trying to hump her) But one of the lion&rsquo;s tail was being
chewed on by the 3 lions including herself.</p>

<p><p>At Emerson, I met Amy &amp; Janna, daughters of Jan, minister of
Emerson.  They were pretty.  After the thing, me, Cheri, &amp; Ma stopped
by Transco falls and the City Hall Christmas lights.  I took Cheri
home and then came home to Tomball.</p>

<p><p>Just now, Fred said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who can eat the most sweet tarts.&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;Crud. I had wanted to save some for tomorrow..&rdquo; We each
crammed 27 Sweet Tarts into our mouths.  Try it.  We could not chew.
We started to laugh - cracking up laughing. Dying laughing.  We had to
go outside so as to not cough them up on the carpet.  I started to
choke and spat them into my hand.  Fred couldn&rsquo;t chews them and
drooled them off the porch into the grass.  He said, &ldquo;Oh Well.&rdquo;  I
started cracking up more and spat them back into my hand and then
threw them as far as possible.  HA HA HA.  We were dying laughing.
Tears &amp; the whole works.  It must have been a location joke, though,
since you&rsquo;re not laughing.</p>
