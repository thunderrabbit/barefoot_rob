      <description>19:22 Sunday 29 July 2018 JST We ordered some refrigerated food before heading to Niigata. For some reason it was not labeled as needing refrigeration so it sat on the counter for a day until just now when we got home.</description>

      <description>##23:08 Saturday 22 November 2014 JST##
Out in the field, we did meditation, then a visualization to show the ETs where we are located.
We saw a few falling stars, but nothing else obvious.
I&amp;rsquo;m writing now because I just came back to the cabin to get the main laser pointer.

We just arrived back in our cabin. Saw lots of flashes in the sky, like the whole sky lit up just for a twentieth or 100th of a second, about maybe 20 times over the course of nearly 5 hours we were out there.</description>
