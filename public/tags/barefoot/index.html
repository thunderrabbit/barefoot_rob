<p>Max and I met at The Pink Cow where Lin and I were going to meet,
but she ended up heading home instead after work.  After filling up on
world famous bean burritos at The Pink Cow, we walked to Roppongi
Midtown where we spent a considerable amount of time wondering how to
measure if the circular glass window over the white
not-really-egg-shaped stone is round or not.  I ultimately decided it
was not round because the wires inside the glass (which travel at 45
degree angles to the edge) did not bisect the quadrangle shapes,
making them rectangle, not square.</p>

<p>With the tools we had available, I could not think of a way.  The
best I could think of would be to take a string on opposite sides of
the shape and walk around the circumfrence.</p>

<p>Max decided to try barefooting with me so he took off his shoes
and we headed down the escalator and to the white stone to get the
only pictures of the night.</p>

<p>Headed to Roppongi Hills and wandered around on different surfaces
from astroturf to vents blowing air up through the floor.</p>

<p>Went back to Roppongi Crossing and down the bar-crawl street to chat
with the Nigerian guys who invite us into the bar.  Tonight I claimed
I could not afford shoes, and one guy said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nice to see some
poor people around here,&rdquo; which Max and I decided was a really
funny thing to say/hear.</p>

<p>We ended up going up into a bar for a moment because the guy said it
was free, but bounced after talking to them a bit upstairs.  It&rsquo;s free
<em>if</em> we buy a drink.  Max was like &ldquo;let&rsquo;s bounce&rdquo; so we headed out and
he goes &ldquo;that was scary,&rdquo; citing that they would &ldquo;probably&rdquo; spike our
drinks, etc.  Yeah, it could happen, and would definitely not be my
intended way to enjoy an evening!  I wonder how to protect against
that except pour my own drink or see the bottle be opened.</p>

<p>The next guy said we can go to a real topless bar, but we did not head
up there (it was definitely not free), but I asked if I could come
back with Lin.  He was like &ldquo;yeah sure&rdquo; so I guess it would be okay.
Doubt she would go for it, but could be fun.</p>

<p>Headed home via Nogizaka station where I gave Max a hug and see ya
sometime.</p>

<p>Today on my way back home from lunch, I saw a construction site which
was overlookable from a pretty steep hill just beside it.</p>

<p>By standing on the guardrail, I could easily have fallen forward over
their fence.  Nice shot, though!</p>

<p>After Yomiuriland yesterday, the skin on the bottom of my left foot
split a bit.  This morning I superglued it shut and put some tape over
it.  Seems to be okay.</p>

<h5 id="10-38-sunday-14-april-2019-jst">10:38 Sunday 14 April 2019 JST</h5>

<p>I put on socks and shoes to take off my shoes as I went into Lantz&rsquo;s
office.  I left my shoes on during my trip back home as the split is
painful.</p>

<p>Tonight in Noborito station, I got off the train to try to figure out
which train would be fastest to my station. A woman saw me barefoot
and asked where I was going. She kindly looked up my station and
confirmed my hunch that the next train was fastest to Shin Yurigaoka.</p>

<p>While riding on the train together, she asked me why I was barefoot,
and then what I was doing in Japan.  I talked about my dream to reduce
the suicide rate in Japan, and she reflected on the gravity of the
situation.  She asked me what I thought it was the reason the Japanese
commit suicide, and I said is because I think some people are unable
to talk about serious topics and they end up feeling alone, with no
other way to solve whatever problem they are having.</p>

<p>The conversation was relatively short and sweet; it&rsquo;s only about 8
minutes to my stop.  When getting off the train, I had an urge to
offer a hug so I did, and she accepted.</p>

<p>It was a nice connection, and I wish I had had my business cards or
was thinking quickly enough to trade contact information.  Maybe this
entry will suffice.</p>

<p class="dream">Walking outside, I realized I was wearing hiking
boots and was shocked that I was wearing them while walking around on
vacation.  I asked store owner if I could have a bag to put them in,
but he said he could not give me one, but I could not understand the
reason why.  I walked further and found a place to put my boots in a
locker so I did that and saw Yumi there who taking things out of her
locker and she said I could put my shoes with her stuff with kinda the
implication that her son would be able to wear them when he got older.
That's fine with me and I was glad to be barefoot again, but I
wondered if I would really never need them in the next 15 years; I do
wear them in winter sometimes!</p>

<p>While I was walking out of Ueno station, a tall man and I did the
foreigner nod and then he said he had seen me on TV (for being
barefoot).  We shook hands and talked for a bit about the importance
of doing one&rsquo;s own thing.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;I respect you,&rdquo; and I should have said if he sees
respectability in me, that means it&rsquo;s in him, too.</p>

<p>I gotta stop and chat a bit longer to people who say HI like that, but
I dunno what to say.  Maybe I will ask if they live in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I was stopped by the cops in our new neighborhood, ostensibly because
I was barefoot, but possibly because I&rsquo;m ostensibly not Japanese.</p>

<p>They asked if I had shoes (no), if I was okay (yes), where I was going
(work), what was my job (programmin&rsquo;), where was my job (ebisu), where
was my crib (right over there).  I offered that I had been barefoot
for 7 years in the US and going on year 3 (or is it 4) here, and I was
on TV recently, blah blah.</p>

<p>A woman walking by asked them if I needed shoes; I told her no but
thank you very much.</p>

<p>The cops wrote down my infos and said everything was fine, but just to
be careful for glass.  Will do!</p>

<p>Honestly, they were both quite friendly.  One even asked to see the
bottom of my feet, and said the TV show I was on is one he often
watches.  Any ill will I&rsquo;m projecting is due to mass and social media.</p>

<p>I still made it to my train on time.  The end.</p>
