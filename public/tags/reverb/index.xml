      <description>(transcribed from Book Six 1:54pm JST Sunday 28 June 2009 (day 14340))
7:50PM Friday 3 December 1993 Day (Page44)
I have decided to not keep track of exactly what day I&#39;m on each day. I&#39;ll keep this pointer back to page 44 that will tell me the last recorded day count so I can recalculate it. The only reason for this is that maybe the days will go by faster, not that they are going slowly now.</description>
