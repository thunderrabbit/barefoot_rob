Moe Joe. AB server ELB is causing or revealing 502s. Locally, I rebooted my elderly Macbook and the USB cable is still not working. I reset the printer system and the printer still will not print. I tried to copy a document and the printer would not copy it. And latest version of Hugo is not creating my website subdirectories (/journal or /blog).</description>

      <description>13:07 Thursday 08 August 2019 JST Dreamhosts lists their server key as something like
canyonville.dreamhost.com,64.90.48.21 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABA&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
But in order to install it on my Brother printer for its scan-to-sftp function, the key needed to start with ssh-rsa. So I removed &amp;ldquo;canyonville&amp;hellip;..21&amp;rdquo; from the front of the key and it works fine.
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCnJdr5AbHwfaU+F+pv4BzcgNnPBBvbCh7&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
Is Dreamhost confused about how to show their server keys? Is Brother behind the times in accepting latest standards?</description>
