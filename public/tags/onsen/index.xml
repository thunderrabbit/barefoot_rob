      <description>13:47 Thursday 09 May 2019 JST Robert Golden and I enjoyed chatting at the onsen near Minami-tama station on JR Nambu line. Great to get to know each other better. I told him about how I ended up in Japan, including Tammy, Bonnie, Wende, janette, Lin. We talked about MKP Japan and the work we are doing here. I learned how he ended up in Hawaii.
I wished we could hang out longer at the onsen; I did not finish all my lunch and did not finish sitting in all the pools + both saunas.</description>

      <description>We ate ramen then ice cream.
 
17:03 Saturday 24 December 2016 JST Now we are headed to a hot foot bath, which I guess is 足温 泉足おんせん in Japanese. Oops it&amp;rsquo;s 足湯うあしゆう
Good for me since I&amp;rsquo;m barefoot, and it&amp;rsquo;s about 3C outside.
18:02 Saturday 24 December 2016 JST mmmmm that was nice. Also nice to talk to some of the locals. I dropped the anger that usually comes up when people tell me how &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; my Japanese is, and just talked to them the best I could.</description>
