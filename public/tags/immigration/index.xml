      <description>08:29 Friday 06 October 2017 JST Here is my QR code which apparently lets me through the immigration gate in a breeze. So nice that they have this service! On my way out of Narita, the lines to go through the human powered checkpoints were quite long compared to the lack of lines in the automated gates. Hmmm&amp;hellip; so I went over there and they helped me get registered free of charge!</description>
