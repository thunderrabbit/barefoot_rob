<p>(written 23:04 Tuesday 24 September 2019 JST)</p>

<p>Usually Lin checks in with me on her way home, but she has not checked
in with me yet.  I wrote this to Mark on LINE:</p>

<pre><code>23:00 barefoot Rob Nugen Just checking in now; Lin is not home and not answering her phone or LINE
23:01 barefoot Rob Nugen It's possible she is out with friends, but usually she tells me if she will be late
23:01 barefoot Rob Nugen I won't seriously worry until after last train
23:02 barefoot Rob Nugen I do not need any support now, but I will let you know if I do.
23:02 barefoot Rob Nugen I assume she will come home, so from your point of view please treat this as
                         no news is good news.  i.e no further updates from me means she came home fine.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="23-18">23:18</h5>

<p>She called me; she is fine, just was out with co-workers due to
someone&rsquo;s last day at work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on a local train in Shinjuku which will leave in less than a

<p>Not as late as last night, but may not get to bed by my target of
midnight.</p>

<p>Watched too much damn ER with Lin, but I gotta admit it&rsquo;s a good
show.  We are at Season 5 Episode 3 or so.</p>

<p>Had three meetings this morning, getting off to a great start, but did
<em>not</em> do any paid work.  Did do 1.3 hours of MT3, but have not
uploaded the results yet.  Might as well do that tonight.</p>

<p>Okay Dragonframe is exporting the clip now.</p>

<p>Did some good work on ConSwi as well.</p>

<p>One of the fans on my computer is making noise.  I need to reboot the
machine anyway, so I guess I will do that and take it apart tonight.</p>

<h2 id="23-51">23:51</h2>

<p>Okay Dragonframe finished exporting the snippet.</p>

<h2 id="23-54">23:54</h2>

<p>Just watched a couple episodes of Rick and Morty on Netflix.  From
season 1, the Zigerian scammers, and then the Mr Needful half of the
Pluto episode (, fast forwarding through the Pluto parts).</p>

<p>This was after Japanese lesson with Mel, who often gives me bonus time
yay!  We read a few pages of a Doraemon book with 100 four-kanji words.</p>

<p>All that was after eating chocolate on the way home from the station
after reading <em>Planet on Purpose</em> after talking to Yoko after the
lesson after receiving the remainder of the chocolate rabbit she
brought to class after she arrived late after we had been talking
about <em>Planet on Purpose</em> after talking about Skype after having
talked about the lesson from last week after Mayumi asked me about it
after not having been there then.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s lesson started after I helped some people from Atlanta Georgia
charge their Suica after I charged my own card after arriving in
Akihabara after taking the train from Kawasaki after buying a bottle
of milk tea after noting it came with a chipmunk character (from Chip
and Dale) <em>inside</em> an adjacent bottle after going into the shop after
having finished four lessons at the SCC, including tweaking some
translation about a new exhibit, after learning that &ldquo;exhibit&rdquo; in
Japanese is てんじ, though I am not sure of its spelling.</p>

<p>I had gone to SCC after reading <em>Planet on Purpose</em> on the train after
leaving home after working on ConSwi after attending the Court of
Support meeting after checking in and out of my Integration Group,
&ldquo;Cyber Knights&rdquo; after having breakfast after Lin made it after we woke
up.</p>

<p>Heh.  Well, it was pretty great.  Dirk Gently&rsquo;s Holistic Detective
Agency was good enough that I just watched the last four (4) episodes
in a row.  At 40+ minutes each that&rsquo;s 160+ minutes or about oh my god
I have to go to bed.</p>

<p>We have arrived back in Haneda and are in a taxi back home.  Didn&rsquo;t
realize trains would not be running very late so yay for 12000 yen for
stale smoke flavored taxi.</p>

<p>Last train was at 11:51 and would require two transfers, including
from KQ Kawasaki to JR Kawasaki station.</p>

<p>I get to work on MT3 tomorrow yayyy!</p>

<pre><code>TL;DR:  Would you like donuts delivered to your place on Monday morning Nov 20th?

details: Story time!  Today I was inexplicably late for class which
happens to be near your place.  I told them I would get donuts before
class next week.  I found a donut place, checked Google Maps to see
how to get to the class... and the track goes right by your house!

I don't want to bother you guys on a work day, but I do want to come
say HI with donuts if it's convenient for you!

The class starts at 12:00 so I would have to leave at 11:30 at the latest.
