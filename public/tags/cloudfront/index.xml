      <description>15:24 Friday 02 March 2018 JST We have an image server behind cloudfront. Cloudfront can serve everything via https when using its subdomain. But using our own domain with https isn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as I would like.
Running Lets Encrypt on the server, I get an error like the https request was not allowed.
So I created a certificate with AWS Certificate Manager and told Cloudfront to use it, but I do not see how to tell the server to use it.</description>
