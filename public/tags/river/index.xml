      <description>00:08 Saturday 09 September 2017 JST First time to hang out with Michael one on one. We ate at a cafe in the station and then went barefoot out on a balcony where we talked to a mom waiting for her kid to come back from school. Michael chatted with her a bit, introducing us.. I was kinda amazed because even though my Japanese is better, I&amp;rsquo;m not as willing to break the ice with people.</description>
