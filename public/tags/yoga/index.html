<p>Lin and I are on the train from Paola and Jon&rsquo;s house; we were the
only two students in yoga class, so we got all the attention and all
the goodies after the lesson. Yummy chicken stew something, several
types of cheese + sembe, and a fruit pie with three or four types of
fruit jam filling. Yumm!</p>

<p>We went for an hour walk around Lin&rsquo;s former high school; Jon and I
talked about boy stuff while Lin and Paola talked about girl stuff.
There was a house under construction on the corner and its foundation
had just been poured, or had it? I put my foot on it to test&hellip; Wet
concrete!! Ooops hahahaha! Jon mad a bit of a mark and I was like,
&ldquo;better not tell the girls,&rdquo; and we didn&rsquo;t. Funny that Lin is reading
over my shoulder as I type this (to the whole internettes).</p>

<p>After the walk, Paola suggested we watch a movie upstairs. I had
never been upstairs in her house, so it was a whole new experience for
me! Lin was like, &ldquo;realllY??&rdquo; because she&rsquo;s been upstairs so many
times hanging out with Paola. Paola pulled out a few Indian DVDs; Jon
and I were like, &ldquo;well hmmm&rdquo; as we read the synopses. Then when Paola
pulled out Fun with Dick and Jane, Lin was like, &ldquo;yay!! let&rsquo;s see
that!!&rdquo; and it was decided. Cute movie, and a nice surprise at the
end.</p>

<p>Afterward, we were going to go to the Pecha Kucha thing in Roppongi
tonight, but my head hurts, plus we&rsquo;d be late arriving, so eff it;
let&rsquo;s go home.</p>

<p>Right now we are sitting in Shibuya station on the Inokashira Line
platform as I write, Lin plays on her phone, people and trains come
and go.</p>
