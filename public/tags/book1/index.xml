      <description>(transcribed from my diary 5:36pm CST Monday 20 January 2003)
(this entry written 29 March 1987)
Hello! This is my new diary. I&#39;ve had this book lying around in my closet for a long time. It&#39;s been waiting for a good use. So now it&#39;s Robert &#34;Ted&#34; (RoberTed) Nugen&#39;s Diary. I&#39;ll need a name for it later. I need to tell about me. No telling who may find this thing. I was born March 25, 1970, in Fort Knox, Kentucky.</description>
