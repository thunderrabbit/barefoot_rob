      <description>09:58 Wednesday 04 April 2018 JST I added lots of frames yesterday to Marble Track 3 video. There was a long section with just 2 or 3, or even just 1 character moving at a time. I added 20 seconds to the video, which destroys any previous day expect maybe the first couple days when I just had the manager walking around.
I did not exactly predict the current situation; I just knew the chopstick poking off the edge of the track should do something.</description>
