<p>I think it has been 20 minutes.  Let&rsquo;s see:</p>

<p>yay!</p>

<h5 id="02-00-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">02:00 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>I sometimes think I feel it more if I talk.</p>

<p>My dad said I am a responsible person.
If anything goes wrong, I am responsible.</p>

<h5 id="03-12-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:12 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Okay finally kicked in after another hit.</p>

<h5 id="03-18-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:18 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Was able to floss my teeth in 4 minutes but it felt like a lot more in
some ways.  I ate coconut clusters and brownie, and finished eating,
and (an hour) later finished flossing, then my teeth are clean, and
now about to pee.</p>

<h5 id="03-26-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:26 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Finished peeing and now cannot quite finishes sentences all in one go.</p>

<p>That seemed like 50 years until this timestamp from the previous one.</p>

<h5 id="03-30-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:30 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Oats is flossing his teeth and laughing that I made his name Oats to
protect his identity.</p>

<h5 id="03-32-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:32 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Super great to talk with Oats and type at the same time.  Time is
really going slowly in one direction and in this typing direction, the
muscle memory of my typing allows me to keep a good hold on what I
know to be the correct direction of time.</p>

<h5 id="03-33-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:33 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>This seems like it has been a long time with Oats flossing and keeping
track of which tooth he is flossing.</p>

<h5 id="03-34-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:34 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>My computer is the size of an imax that is real far away.</p>

<p>While this seems like a long time, it is a short time according to the
timestamps.</p>

<h5 id="03-37-monday-18-march-2019-pdt">03:37 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Oats wife calls this flinging when the bits of food fly from his
dental floss.  How long has he been flossing?</p>

<p>Why are all these timestamps almost the same?</p>

<h5 id="03-37-monday-18-march-2019-pdt-1">03:37 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT</h5>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t I go lie down?</p>

<p>Had a little nap for 3 hours or so</p>

<p>Distracted now watching Logan Lucky while writing and trying to
remember whsat I was going to write.</p>

<p>While sleeping I guess I felt the plane dip a bit and it appeared in
my dream</p>

<p class="dream">We descended and hovered down by the water down by
the cruise ship.  I didn't recognize any of my old friends there, but
was optimistic there were some onboard.  It seemed we were a couple of
days after everyone else, so the cheerful arrival high had waned. I
remembered I had not brought Francois on this trip, and it would be
even more acute here on the ship.  I saw some other stuffed animals
and considered another replacement but decided not to.  Woke up soon
thereafter</p>

<p>Writing very slowly, it&rsquo;s now 3 hours to Haneda.</p>

<p>Ten point five hours to go in our flight.  It&rsquo;s 5am Sao Paulo time,
and 4pm Tokyo time.  I took a 3.5 hour nap in Sao Paulo and woke up
around 8:45pm (and wrote a journal entry about a dream I had writing a
journal entry about a dream I had) and have thereby been awake 8
hours.  I plan to be awake 6 more hours, at which point I will have 4
more hours of flight time to sleep before we arrive in Dubai.</p>

<p>I think we arrive a couple/few hours before Happy New Year celebration
starts in Dubai.</p>

<p>When it&rsquo;s midnight in Dubai, I think it will be 5am in Tokyo.  I will
sleep for a few hours, waking up at maybe 9 or 10am Tokyo time, by
which point I plan to have reversed A and P, and be over any residual
jetlag.</p>

<p>I think we thought the flight leaves at 00:15, in which case we would
begin boarding in 20 minutes or so.  But it&rsquo;s at 01:15 so we have 80
minutes or so.</p>

<p>Lin is shopping for souvenirs though our bags are overweight, and will
apparently cost $100 in Dubai because *they are very strict there&rdquo;</p>

<p>Allow more time when going to the glass museum in Azumino.   Or maybe
just go early.  We went around 10:45 and there was a queue for blowing
glass until 1pm.</p>

<p>I did get to talk to a couple of guys down in the glass blowing room.
Was soooo happy that they did not turn me away for being barefoot.  I
could easily imagine a rule, but apparently there was not.  Anyway I
had no problem with glass so it was fine.  Anyway, I also had no time,
so did not get to make a bottle or glass or anything.  Not sure what I
would have made.  Probably a glass, since it would be most useful for
me.</p>

<p>My slow walk to station time takes 25 minutes</p>

<p>Sub times:</p>

<ul>
<li>3:00 from house to first light</li>
<li>4:00 from light to top of valley</li>
<li>5:00 from top of valley to next light</li>
<li>4:00 from light after valley</li>
<li>3:30 valley light to vending and pokestop</li>
<li>2:00 from last traffic light to last light</li>
<li>3:30 from last light to platform</li>
</ul>

<p>Given these intervals, if I&rsquo;m late leaving for the station, I only
need to catch up to one of these points and I know I can walk slowly again.</p>
