<ol>
<li>Yesterday I walked from Shinjuku to Hiroo, from the men&rsquo;s group new
meeting location to our old one.  Last night we met for the last
time at Takeshi&rsquo;s office, and next week we will be in Shinjuku, at
a place I have not yet seen.  I have booked it for all of September
and October, and trust we can get it for longer if we like it.</li>
<li>I did my first workshop last month (Eye Gazing, on August 17th).
We had a great turnout so I am planning to do it again on September
28th.  Yay!</li>
<li>Last night Mark gave me the idea of doing workshops for a living.
It certainly fits my skillset <a href="/journal/2019/09/03/brain-pounding-eyes-vibrating-too-much-computer/">moreso than programming</a>!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 now features CSFERP (Caret Splitter Feeder
Extenstion Reflection Protection), put in place yesterday by
Reversible Guy.</li>
<li>I have not yet gotten into the groove of writing blog entries, but
recently I have put that on my daily ROBOT pages as a 10 point todo
item.</li>
<li>I have been keeping daily ROBOT pages since May, thanks to Hiro for
the idea.</li>
<li>I had my first session with Dean Ramsden.  It was less illuminating
than I guessed/hoped it might be, but I have different sets of
questions for next time.</li>
<li>Lin and I have been doing better over the past month or more,
mostly because I have been chilling tf out and being more
accomodating for communication styles and grammars.</li>
<li>I got AB&rsquo;s DB moved to AWS RDS.  Yay!  Thanks to Travis for
introducing me to Ansible.  Thanks to Ansible for making things
replicable.</li>
<li>I created a Page on FB.
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/barefootrob/">Barefoot Rob</a>.  I
resisted giving in to the borg for a long time, and still want to
keep my content on my server, but they make it so dang easy!</li>
<li>I am ecstatic with the turnout from
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2465227863708851/">my first Eye Gazing workshop</a>;
14 people attended, incluing myself.  I have scheduled a second
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/493730671447073/">Eye Gazing workshop</a>
for Sep 28th, and a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2054284838201319/">Remembering Past Lives</a>
workshop for September 7th.  Looking forward to both!</li>
<li>I have been fascinated with the idea of channeling information
from non-local sources.
<a href="https://www.bashar.org/">Bashar via Darryl Anka</a> is the first
that I paid attention to, and now Abraham via
<a href="https://www.abraham-hicks.com">Esther Hicks</a>.  I wonder about
developing my own channeling skills.</li>
<li>Jennie is still our cat. Lin recently said Jennie is 7 years old.</li>
<li>I still do not have a driver&rsquo;s license in Japan (nor the US, since
my old license expired).  Lin wants me to get one, but I do not
really want to drive in Tokyo.  Especially not have to drive her
&ldquo;big&rdquo; minivan.</li>
<li>I showed up 25 minutes late to my online group today and no one
was there.  It&rsquo;s like my worst dream come true, after I had just
written a page of gratitude to the men of the group for keeping it
going while I am not in attendance.</li>

<li>My old thunderrabbit router conked out so now we are using a new one
with three antennas and mutiple channels and all that good stuff.</li>
<li>The conking coincided with new printer disallowing login so I reset
the networking and therefore lost the few scan-to-ssh profiles I
had set up.  I have half of them restored and a few new ones
planned.</li>
<li>This allows me to scan A4 pages and upload to my b.robnugen.com
server (b stands for binary).  Most of them are going to be in
<a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/">https://b.robnugen.com/robot/</a> (where robot represents for R.O.B.O.T., which
stands for my personal <a href="https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Category:R.O.B.O.T.">religion I made</a> after reading
<a href="https://archive.org/details/shavinginsideofy00ashm">Shaving the Inside of your Skull</a>
by Mel Ash) whereas others will be in other directories</li>
<li>I have started writing my dreams and scanning them to
<a href="https://b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/">https://b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/</a> In the future I hope to
have an automagic way to display thumbnails, allow paging through
the images, transcribing them, and naming the files nicely.</li>
<li>For now, the filenames created by the scanner include date, name,
topic, and a counter which shows the order in which they were
scanned.</li>
<li>I recently discovered I apparently applied to JB in October 2014 (I
think)</li>
<li>I have recently scheduled two (2) workshops. Oh snap I should
invite people to them.</li>
<li>August 17th <a href="Eye
Gazing Workshop">https://www.facebook.com/events/2465227863708851/</a>, which will allow people to really connect deeply
to themselves and others in a safe heart-filled space</li>
<li>The next workshop is scheduled for September 7th, a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2054284838201319/">past life memories workshop</a>.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s been several days since I started item 9 above, and I just
finished it by adding the link.</li>
<li>The past several days have been filled with working on AB.  I am
pretty close to having a migration path to get them onto RDS with
almost no downtime.  After that will be to have their web server
deployable via script.  Thank you Travis for having introduced me
to Ansible some years ago.</li>
<li>Rainy season has finished so now it&rsquo;s typhoon season. wait, what?</li>
<li>11 people are signed up for the workshop on Saturday.  I&rsquo;m super
looking forward to having a great experience with everyone.</li>
<li>I got
<a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/templates/2019/R.O.B.O.T._Daily_Pages_version_2019_Aug_14.pdf">my Daily ROBOT page</a>
fixed enough that I am thinking of taking the time to make an HTML
version so I can track its history.  I used
<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">Libre Office</a> to make the PDF so I
wouldn&rsquo;t have to muck with CSS, etc.  But now I want to make a
clean CSS version.  Possible?  Nah forget it.  PDF versions are
fine for now.</li>
<li>Our cat Jennie is doing fine.  She sleeps like a log instead of a
bun because it&rsquo;s summer.</li>
<li>Just yesterday or so I started listening to my CDs from
<a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org/">The Monroe Institute</a> which I
bought after taking the week long
<a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org/Gateway%20Voyage%20Program">Gateway Voyage</a>
back in 1996 or 1997. It still works!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 most recently got the Lower Zig Zag 3ban Lower
Support, and the Lowest Largest U-turn Berm glued into place.  I
plan to work on it a bit more today.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In the meantime, maybe write up your personal history and your goals
for the work you want done, and I’ll study it ahead of time, so we
can jump right in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was a child, my dad showed me how to use coat hangers as
divining sticks to find water.  At the time, I thought it was strange.
&ldquo;Why should I have to use sticks if I can just think the question and
know the answer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not apparently put this intuition to any practical purpose, but
I did do a few Tarot card readings based on this kind of channeled
information. I hadn&rsquo;t read about individual card meanings in Tarot,
But I would have people ask a question and then choose cards at
randomly and then I would just freestyle information that came
through.</p>

<p>I grew fascinated with the idea of &ldquo;astral travel&rdquo; and consciously, I
got as far as lucid dreaming, But not astral travel that I know of, or
at least not in the way that my imagination wanted it to happen.</p>

<p>If I practice recalling my dreams, while dreaming, I will often
recognize that &ldquo;I am in that place where I can fly and control things&rdquo;
But while in that dream state, I usually don&rsquo;t recall that my physical
body is somewhere.</p>

<p>One time while sleeping, I was doing gymnastics that I realized I
couldn&rsquo;t do my physical body.  I recognize I was in some state
of consciousness where my consciousness was outside of my body. (After
listening to your lecture, I guess this was my etheric body outside my
physical body.)</p>

<p>In the way that I naturally have proprioception, I realized my body
was folded over (which my physical body cannot do under normal waking
conditions).  I tried to allow myself to float out of my body. I got
as far as my body being up in the air, but my head was stuck inside my
head.</p>

<p>I slowly came back into waking consciousness and felt my body gliding
down into my physical body in a smooth transition, featuring lots of
vibrational tingling as the bodies merged.  (Maybe this is the same
tingling as in the shower exercise you mentioned.)</p>

<p>I felt a lot of joy and excitement around this, and I began seeking
things to study.  I read one of Robert Monroe&rsquo;s books and soon went to
The Monroe Institute for their week long Gateway Voyage residential
training (in 1997 or so, a few years after his death).</p>

<p>At TMI&rsquo;s Gateway Voyage, I had a few interesting experiences regarding
states of consciousness, but did not &ldquo;astral travel&rdquo; the way I had
hoped.</p>

<p>We got to meet Joe McMoneagle and I became facinated with the how the
Life Review works upon death (or near death).   (You mentioned the
tunnel of light and said you can talk more about  that process.  I
would be curious to do so as I remember one of my experiences as a
ghost believing I did not deserve to go through the tunnel.)</p>

<p>At TMI, we watched the Powers of Ten video
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_Ten_(film)#1977_(%22Final%22)_version">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_Ten_(film)#1977_(%22Final%22)_version</a>
and I cried for a grain of sand in the sidewalk after recognizing how
it had been ignored despite is crucial role in the world.</p>

<p>Around the same time, I began emotional catharsis work with Mankind
Project.  In my weekend training, I realized I was physically a man.
At age 27, I still felt like a boy.</p>

<p>I am going to make a jump here from biography to underlying patterns.</p>

<p>I often suffer from anger issues.  I once complained to my parents
that they were being too nice to each other.  I might describe their
behavior now as having been codependent.  They didn&rsquo;t take care of
their own needs first.</p>

<p>I have often given my power away to women, trying to make mommy happy
so that I can get her love.  I recognize that the work is to be done
within myself, and the reality of the world around me is a reflection
of that.  These are words I can say theoretically, but I don&rsquo;t really
know what they mean for me nor how to apply them in my life.</p>

<p>I often fall into crushes with women, and I have learned to deal with
that by simply not acting on it&hellip;</p>

<p>I get the very most easily angry when I judge people do not understand
me.  (How very curious I find myself in a cross-cultural marriage
where not being understood is the norm.)</p>

<p>Looking for the source of this anger regarding communication, the only
things that have kind of made sense are from past lives that I&rsquo;ve
uncovered.</p>

<p>One spontaneous past life memory was when my army buddy was killed
after not listening to my guidance.</p>

<p>In another past life, there was a larger scale massacres where
thousands of my men were ambushed and died due to a tactical mistake I
had made.  (where they DID listen to me and it got them killed)</p>

<p>In other past life news, I have a birthmark where apparently I was
stabbed, and I recall dying, feeling so sad that my wife would not get
the money that I had earned while being in war.  (This lifetime, the
first time I washed my wife&rsquo;s back, I remembered that it was not the
first time I had washed her back, and in fact my present-lifetime wife
may have played the role of the woman who I left with kids while I
died in battle.)</p>

<p>In a different past life, I remember being a big simple man, who was
taking care of by a witch who lived up the hill because she was
ostracized by the community.  She would send me into town with simple
shopping tasks.</p>

<p>In a different past life (which I mentioned above), I committed ritual
suicide and remained on earth believing my transgression had been too
great to let me go to &lsquo;heaven&rsquo;.  The facilitator (Kevin Turner, who
you may well know) said &ldquo;look up&rdquo; and my dead-self looked up and was
shocked to see everyone waiting patiently for me.  My physical self
started bawling and crying like oh my god finally, etc etc.</p>

<p>Back to my present lifetime:</p>

<p>At age 8 or so this lifetime, my dad told me how incredibly smart and
talented I was.  In some ways, this information has been a curse on
me, as I have assumed I should be able to figure things out.  I often
shame myself for not having figured things out the first time through.</p>

<p>In a different anecdote from this lifetime, my dad and I were paddling
in a canoe on the lake somewhere.  It was a beautiful father-son
experience. His friend came by with the small motorboat, and offered to
tow us ashore.  The experience of the raw speed in a canoe was
thrilling.  I absolutely loved it and would love to do it again
sometime.  Afterward, my dad said his friend said I was &ldquo;grinning from
ear to ear.&rdquo;  I hated to know that I had been seen and that I had
been somehow caught in this moment of joy.</p>

<p>And yet another anecdote from this lifetime, my dad knocked down a
wasps&rsquo; nest from under the eave of our house.  The wasps were all dead,
but I was still scared of the nest.  I gathered up all of my courage
and threw the nest into the street, then suddenly heard cheers from my
parents.  I was shocked and angry that they had been watching me the
whole time.  Somehow my test of courage had not been such a test after
all.  I should&rsquo;ve known it wasn&rsquo;t dangerous because they (apparently)
knew it.</p>

<h5 id="11-06-monday-22-july-2019-jst">11:06 Monday 22 July 2019 JST</h5>

<p>At this point I am taking a break in writing.</p>

<h5 id="17-13-thursday-25-july-2019-jst">17:13 Thursday 25 July 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Main things I would like to look at in our work</p>

<p>Improve my ability to find clients who value my services.  I would
like to make enough money that I can let go of my current programming
job and let my wife feel comfortable in doing work she loves instead
of doing work for money.</p>

<p>I often get feedback that what I said was really helpful or
insightful.  My secret is that it&rsquo;s often channeled information,
though I do not know much about my source.  Would like to learn more
about the source and how to build a relationship with my source.</p>

<p>I have listened to Bashar as channeled by whatshisname (who keeps
saying extraterrestrial disclosure is coming), and have been listening
to Abraham as channeled by Esther Hicks.  I love what you said about
it being simplified.   However, the reason I brought up these channels
is that I have sometimes thought I could do that.  Should I keep it
low-key and just channel as I mentioned above.  As I wrote the
question, the answer came: meet my channelee first.</p>

<p>I feel fear and sadness when I don&rsquo;t pursue this line of questions.  I
want you (or someone, anyone but meeeee) to give me all the answers.
Holy cats maybe that is my sadness of being disconnected from my
channelee.  (is there a word for that? the spirit being channeled?)</p>

<p>When reading the book <em>Shaving The Inside of Your Skull</em>, I created my
own religion, ROBOT (Rob&rsquo;s Own Brand of Teachings), which includes the
concept of EPP, the Ever Present Present.  Why did I even bring that
up with you now?</p>

<p>Improve my skillset in terms of healing.  I have always been
fascinated with astral, and finding your simple structured
introduction has been lovely.  What you say makes sense to my maps and
seems like something I could easily put into practice.</p>

<p>Improve connection in our marriage.  I hide parts of myself from my
wife Lin out of fear of her reaction.</p>

<p>Spend more time on my art projects because they are fun and bring a
lot of joy to me in making and people in seeing.  How can they support
my financial abundance?</p>

<li>I met Yuri Logo today to talk about making a logo for my brand.
She was recommended by Rin so I was like yay!  She asked lots of
questions and said she had good ideas for it.  I could see in her
smile the excitement and I felt good about that.</li>
<li>I will be working with Rin in a life coaching capacity.  I look
forward to an accountability partner and learning some new
facilitation techniques.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com">Marble Track 3 website</a> now has a
Construction section, which shows some of the snippets.  Not all
the snippets are there, and they are not all fully fleshed out yet,
but I look forward to finishing that section, especially if I can
do it via a data file which can be parsed in differen ways.</li>
<li>Lin has been enjoying her new job and will soon get to have flex
time hours, going from 10am to 6pm.  Hopefully the trains will be a
bit less packed in the mornings.</li>
<li>We bought a laser printer recently.  I did it out of frustration of
buying tons of ink for the inkjet printer, and now I realize what a
great investment it is.  Now I can print pages like wheeee instead
of having a gut wrenching wonder if I would get streaks in the
pages.</li>
<li>I used the printer to print a flyer for our Japanese workshop
coming up in July.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some people could not scan the QR code, so I made one with a normal
square QR code <a href="https://b.robnugen.com/mkpjapan/workshops/2019/Japanese_Journey_of_Heart_July_square_QR_code_2019.png">https://b.robnugen.com/mkpjapan/workshops/2019/Japanese_Journey_of_Heart_July_square_QR_code_2019.png</a></p>

<ol>
<li>I just recently decided to plan on attending a workshop in Houston
in October.  (ShadowWork Facilitator Training) I have not gotten it
sorted out with the organizer yet; I asked him if I have the
prerequisites.</li>
<li>I bought <a href="https://wanb.us/">https://wanb.us/</a> which I might use for my Urbit star, ~wanbus.</li>
<li>I created a template for something like a Five Minute Journal
(which takes more than five minutes, but gives a structure to what
I write).  Kinda like a captain&rsquo;s log, tracking some different
metrics: eating, sleeping, meditation, books, exercise, kisses</li>
<li>I got the idea from Hiro, who has apparently been doing it for years.</li>
<li>After doing these for a few days, I thought it would be cool to be
able to print customized templates for people.  So if you have a
template you&rsquo;d like to print, send it to me and I can print it
out.</li>
<li>I think my knee chair has got to go cause it might be hurting my
knees and hips. I wanna get a yoga ball chair (again).  I will
request one on Freecycling Tokyo.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s now June 5th.  Yesterday I did my first session with Rin, and
came out with seven affirmations, organically discovered by doing
a (n apparently NLP) process that could be called &ldquo;What do I
gain?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What do I gain by not following my dreams?&rdquo;  (snip long chain of
answers and question repetitions featuring new answer) &ldquo;I know
people love me.&rdquo;  Wait, what??</li>
<li>It also makes sense though, in my experience of facilitating
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk&rdquo; hundreds of times.  When I go through that series
of questions, I end up with &ldquo;I will be alone&rdquo; (which is about the
opposite of &ldquo;I know people love me.&rdquo;</li>

<ul>
<li>Lately I&rsquo;ve been saying &ldquo;see you next era&rdquo; in Japanese just do draw
attention to the fact that the era is going to change on May 1st.</li>
</ul>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got a big pack of days off coming this Golden Week: 10!  Most of
my students are glad, but there are some people who are like wtf
because schools and day care will be closed, but the parents (in
service sector jobs) have to work.</p>

<p>I do <em>not</em> have to work, but am not full time so it means no money for
a week, but should be okay.  Sad and shame that a week without pay
would even be a blip in my mind.</p>

<ul>
<li>I just created a new Meetup for the men&rsquo;s circle.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/events/260931056/">Journey of the Heart, a deep honest look at your life</a></p>

<p>How far in advance should I have started promoting?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have started taking Japanese classes again, and started looking
into language exchange again.  I had not done language exchange for
a while because it always ended up unbalanced (imo) toward English.
One Japanese man would even speak German during the Japanese
side. Anyway, I am trying again.</p></li>

<li><p>I have attended badminton twice with Tomoko et.al.  It&rsquo;s quite a fun
group and gives me the chance to speak in Japanese (definitely
unbalanced toward Japanese!!)  The same group is planning to go to a
baseball game on June 30th (2+ months away), so maybe that gives me
an idea of how far in advance I need to schedule stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>I have started looking at Gatsby again to see if I can figure out
how to use it for <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3</a>
website.  I wonder if I should just pay that guy who suggested it.
$4000 seems like a lot but could be worth it.</p></li>

<li><p>I need to make some changes to AB website today or this weekend: add
a new field (lmhs-type) to one of the primary tables. I think I
should have had them done before, but I hate to should on myself.</p></li>

<li><p>Delayna has sent me several Marco Polo messages, but I have not
listened to them yet.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin has started her new job and enjoys the benefits of being full
time, but does not necessarily like the long hours.  She apparently
met someone internet-famous though, so that&rsquo;s interesting.</p></li>

<li><p>Our cat Jennie is fine, enjoying warmer weather, and waking up at
4:40am to go outside.  She lets Lin know it&rsquo;s time be stepping on
Lin&rsquo;s face.</p></li>

<li><p>I am excited about Robert Golden coming to Tokyo.  I met him in
Hawaii and in a nice synchronicity had previously learned he would
be coming to Japan to see his son during the aptly named Golden
Week.</p></li>

<li><p>I have been reading and practicing learnings from The Power of Now,
and Law of Attraction.  Quite interesting new ways to think about
stuff and wonder at the physics behind the scenes.</p></li>

<li><p>314 or so hours of <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/episode/">Marble Track 3 livestreams</a></p></li>

<h5 id="21-46-sunday-03-march-2019-jst">21:46 Sunday 03 March 2019 JST</h5>

<ol>
<li>I will be traveling to the US for 22 days starting March 13th.</li>
<li>Not packed yet, but have it planned for next week.</li>

<li><p>I have just sent a list of workshops to Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle</p>

<p>Men, my stretch was to find workshops that we can do in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I have led #1 and #3 below.  As a group, we did #2 in August 2018
for ourselves, and then again in November 2018 for new men.</p>

<p>#4 can be done online, once a week for 5 to 7 weeks (2 hours per
 week).  This would require some coordination and a trainer from
 the US to help me lead.  I judge it would take a committment from
 6 men to make it worthwhile.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Head Heart and Soul is a 2 hour introduction to the work.  Men
and women can attend.</p></li>

<li><p>Circle of Men, Journey of the Heart is a day long experiential
personal growth workshop.  Men only, but could probably work
for women.  (6-7 hours, including lunch)</p></li>

<li><p>Life Mission workshop lets each man to discover his life’s
Mission, and actions which he can use to bring his mission
present in his life.  This can easily be done in 2 hours.</p></li>

<li><p>Circle Skills training for the classic archetypal MKP-style
integration circle (this gives a solid framework for sitting in
circle)</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>I got a new battery, but it has not worked right.  I understand now I
need to disable sleep mode and let it reallllly run out all the
way.  Dangit.</p></li>

<li><p>Marble Track 3 has over 300 hours of livestream of me making it.</p></li>

<li><p>I probably will not mess with the website for a bit, but the idea
of making it better is tempting.</p></li>

<li><p>The website is at version 2, mostly purple and made by Sanjay and
team in Deli, India.</p></li>

<li><p>The GoFundMe has made $4000+ which more than covers the tickets for my
trip.  We need to set up a company here to keep track of
everything.</p></li>

<li><p>That means I need to start collecting receipts, cause they are
getting pricey!</p></li>

<li><p>I had a killer headache this past Monday from too much
computering, I think.  I can feel another coming on, but I will
head to be soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I am shutting my computer down now/soon and will let the battery run alll the way down</p></li>

<li><p>I think I have a way to fix ConSwi without relying on physics to
keep bricks from going through each other.</p></li>

<li><p>I wanted to work on it today, but did lots of MKP stuff</p></li>

<li>Lin and I still have our cat Jennie, still keep her in at night,
still live in Asao-ku near the bottom of a hill.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still working on Marble Track 3, trying to do at least 2 hours
of livestream per week.</li>
<li>I have been working on AB, getting tests added to cover the
important parts of the codebase.  I do not have a lot covered, but
10 tests is an order of magnitude more than 0.</li>
<li>Plus I figured out a way to test AJAX even though I cannot use
Javascript in my tests yet.  (run the AJAX call directly)</li>
<li>I have all my flights purchased for my trip to Vancouver, Houston,
Austin, Hawaii, all focused on MKP, but trying to see some of my
peeps.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, I messed up regarding seeing Colleenie Beanie
<em>again</em> this year.  I said I will sort it out for sure next year
and she said &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;   Fair enough.</li>
<li>I gotta let my Houston and Austin peeps know.</li>
<li>Have written two video briefs to make two MKP videos. One focused
on inviting men to our circle, and one focused on inviting support
for our circle and expanding into Japanese language.</li>
<li>I have recently been in touch with Brian (also in IT), Tony (truck
driver), and Frederick (change agent) via Zoom.  I asked for
support from them when I was beginning to get overwhelmed with all
the tasks across my variety of projects.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3</a> has had its site
updated via Deligence.  I think we had some minor communication
problems, but the site looks super great compared to what it was.
Maybe I should hire some other peeps to work on it more.</li>
<li>Lesson starting now at Solid Square.</li>

<p>Lots of changes since just three weeks ago.</p>

<ol>
<li>I created a Gofundme with a target of $46,000 to <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/launching-mankind-project-operations-in-japan">kick off Mankind
Project Japan</a>.  $525 so far!</li>
<li>I created a 2.5 minute demo as a TEDx audition vid.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4el81YK3s3Q">Safely expressing emotions makes life better</a>.</li>
<li>Pinky has placed most of the decorative blocks along the
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/parts/decorative_walls_after_the_lowest_small-medium_splitter/">Decorative Walls after the Lowest Small-Medium Splitter</a>,
although I have not taken a new picture that shows all of them so
far.</li>
<li>I have been checking in with Dora each week recently after signing
up for her <a href="https://www.thriveinjapan.com/">Thrive in Japan</a>
course.  She brought the big shifts to my attention so I am writing
about them now!</li>
<li>Shirley has offered 50,000 air miles toward my trip to the US.
Trying to go to Vancouver (and hopefully see Colleenie Beanie Dog!)
then Houston/Austin, then Hawaiiiiii</li>
<li>Delta-Mom has offered a buddy pass ticket price, so that should
help as well!  Gifts from the heavens!</li>
<li>I will be taking a five week course starting this week which should
give me some insights on making Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle even better.</li>
<li>I have been trying to clean up my new.robnugen.com deploy process
so it can run on Netlify.com</li>
<li>Kevin&rsquo;s website was down after a wordpress automatic upgrade failed
to copy over the themes and plugins from the old installation.  I
guess they were in a non-standard location.  I got it fixed though,
and it was nice to talk to him.</li>
<li>I hired a designer to make a nicer version of
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3 website</a>.  As of
this writing, the live site looks like
this
<a href="https://5c42ec0d7c4b6f0008a1f95c--wonderful-bhabha-dfd1ef.netlify.com/">https://5c42ec0d7c4b6f0008a1f95c--wonderful-bhabha-dfd1ef.netlify.com/</a>,

<li>Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle has had an average of 7 men attending each week

<li>Jennie is our cat; she is fine.</li>
<li>I have worn shoes outside once this winter.  Been fine so far,

<li>ConSwi is open source under GNU copyleft.  Several outstanding issues,
the biggest of which are
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/25">#25 disallow dragged pieces to go through other pieces</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/23">#23 Make piece keep up with mouse when dragging</a></li>
<li>I created a
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/marbletrack3">Patreon page for MT3</a> and
have my first patron, Jimmy!</li>
<li>I recently got the fans and battery replaced on my MacBook, but it
still conks out when the battery is at 65%.  I let it run all the
way down to 0 after charging all the way, and did cmd-shift-p-r on
boot.</li>
<li>I have not been writing journal entries very consistently recently</li>
<li>Working on AB, trying to get the code base for both sites up to
snuff with MLAPHP</li>
<li>Working on TY, trying to get the new students up to speed</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has six (6) different supports for the outer spiral,
and they each have webpages on the website, with shortlinks so I can
refer to them easily enough <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/1poss">https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/1poss</a> -
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/6poss">https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/6poss</a>  The /p/ stands for &ldquo;parts&rdquo; as
in &ldquo;parts of the track&rdquo; and Nposs stands for the Nth Placed Outer
Spiral Support.</li>
<li>C and E have their wedding party soon (this coming Thursday)</li>
<li>Lin and I had a date tonight, eating ramen at a local cheap ramen
shop.  They deal with money by having a vending machine that
dispenses colored plastic cards which tell what we ordered.  The
cards are as thick as poker chips, but round-rectangular</li>
<li>Jennie is our cat.  She goes in and out through her cat door on the
2nd floor, which leads to the balcony and her little cat stair-bench
to the roof, to the tree, to the ground (and back).</li>
<li>The Marble Track 3 site is on version 2 now, which focuses on the
characters making the site instead of on me making the site.  I
think it is more interesting this way, but it still needs a tweak
before I am like &ldquo;yep&rdquo;.  The top page isn&rsquo;t right yet..  Currently
shows my inspiration for starting the project, but should show
<em>their</em> inspiration (or something), but I do not yet know what that
is.</li>
<li>Lucifer is in its 3rd season, so I have started watching it on Netflix, so far
not bingeing.</li>
<li>I plan to binge the hell out of Rick and Morty seasons 3 - 99 when
they are available.</li>
<li>My primary non-static web provider said my wiki dedicated to Castle
of Dreams was using too much memory.  I need to convert it to a
static site and let people edit it via git.  Fack when will I ever
make time for that?</li>
<li>Been talking to Dora about getting business started.  She introduced
me to <a href="https://www.danpena.co.uk/">Dan Peña&rsquo;s site</a> and it&rsquo;s like damn.</li>
<li>Speaking of castles, how is it that we live like royalty did back in the
day, but compared to back in the day, we still are like slaves?</li>
