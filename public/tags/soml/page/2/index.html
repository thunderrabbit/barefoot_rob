<h5 id="06-35-thursday-06-september-2018-jst">06:35 Thursday 06 September 2018 JST</h5>

<p>A man has two lives.  The second one begins when he realized he only
has one life.</p>

<p>My second life has begun.  I am feeling the fire in my gut, mixed with
the fear of rejection and failure.  But as I have learned through
experience, if I follow my fear I will be headed in the right
direction in life.</p>

<p>For me these fears result in me dying alone.  There is a process
called What&rsquo;s at Risk which I learned from Mankind Project.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at risk if I do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People might not like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if they do not like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will not like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if they do not like you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if they leave you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will eventually die alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once we get to the bottom, we start over with the other option as a
starting point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at risk if I don&rsquo;t do it?&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will lead a pointless life&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you lead a pointless life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have no enthusiasm&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you have no enthusiasm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have no connection to friends&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you have no connection to friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will die alone&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have been through this chain of broken logic countless times.  In my
case, when I follow the what&rsquo;s at risk line of questions, I always end up dying alone.</p>

<p>I believe the point of the exercise is to point out the logical
fallacy.  Somewehre there is a mis-step in logic.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try it again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People might not like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if people might not like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will adjust it and try again&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aha!  That was quick.  Because my excitement is merged in with the
fear, coming from a core <em>knowing</em> that this is the right way to go.
Or at least the right ballpark or sport.</p>

<p>That knowing is there that I will not just give up.  I will keep
coming back at it from different angles until I get it right.  I just
have to hope I won&rsquo;t be like a mosquito trying to go through a screen
window.</p>

<hr />

<p>So what is the vision?  The vision is to make Emotional Intelligence
as important as that other kind of Intelligence, just plain old
intellect.  The vision is that I can stand listening to someone yell
at me when I fuck up my visa.  &ldquo;You have to leave Japan today!&rdquo; big
man was yelling at me, and I was aware of the fear inside my body, but
did not get pushed around by it.  I could feel it swirling.  &ldquo;I had
fucked up.  My life was ruined.&rdquo;  But I also know fear is an emotion.
It is energy in motion.  Fear is that feeling that comes up when I do
not have enough information to make a decision about the future.  I
want to stay in the country; I am listening to a man yell at me,
saying that I cannot.  I stood there calmly listening.</p>

<p>He paused for second.  &ldquo;Do you understand what I am saying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I assured him I did and reiterated the sailent points.  He agreed that
I got it, but the points pointed to one main point.  I had to leave.</p>

<p>So I punted.  &ldquo;I am planning to get married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had popped the question to Lin a month or so prior to this event.
During that month she kept asking if I had gotten my visa sorted.  &ldquo;I
still have time; the postcard says to do it by July 18th&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turns out, that date didn&rsquo;t matter.  It was the date actually <em>in my
passport</em> that mattered.</p>

<p>To be Continued &hellip;.</p>

<li><p>I have just removed the ## 06:12 Monday 03 September 2018 JST date
from the top of this journal.  Marking them in h2 tags makes them a
bit too big for this theme.  I hate to modify my source code to fit
a theme, but that happened.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently got the <a href="https://marbletrack3.com">website for Mable Track
3</a> (nearly) up to date.  It now has all
the entries that had been in my journal at
<a href="https://new.robnugen.com/tags/mt3/">https://new.robnugen.com/tags/mt3/</a> and all the entries have an
<code>episode_image</code> in the frontmatter.  Not all the entries have a
<em>unique</em> episode image, but that is another matter.</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="https://b.robnugen.com/art/marble_track_3/website/2018_sep_02_mt3_placeholder.png">episode image placeholder for Marble Track 3</a> includes the
text &ldquo;All Episodes (8.97 days)&rdquo; which is a new thing I just added
to the site with the help of <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, Youtube&rsquo;s v3 API (both
of which are Google assets.. hmmm), and
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo static website generator</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Just this morning I split the source into two files, one that
actually does the API calls, and one that does all the
logic to create a list of all my Youtube videos in a TOML file.</p></li>

<li><p>Until this very moment, I had decided to <em>not</em> keep a copy of the
TOML file in any of my repos, but now I think I will, for a couple
of reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>One, so I can show you my
<a href="https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/blob/master/data/playlists/knownvideos.toml">TOML file of all Marble Track 3 videos</a></li>
<li>Two, so the website for Marble Track 3 is easier to recreate
(without installing <del>Go</del> <ins>extra libraries</ins>)</li>
<li>Three, so I can have a <a href="https://github.com/marbletracks/marbletrack3.com/commit/16c9e0acfbebcccf8de83e94ae738e61efdc1f47">history of the file</a>, which currently is <em>not</em> sorted by Publish Date, though I would like it to be
because that would make it easier to figure out what to name the
livestreams that did not get unique names.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>I have just linked git commits both directions from Marble Track 3
source to my journal entries, and from my journal entries to Marble
Track 3 source.  Which ones will break first?</p></li>

<li><p>I am halfway through Anikiko&rsquo;s Shift Your Shit program, subtitled
Own and Sell Your Gifts, or something.  It has been great, giving
me several good ideas, which I am beginning to implement.  Oh, that
reminds me, I need to write to John Gaughan, re: volunteer burnout</p></li>

<li><p>I am using a water Android phone from a couple years ago, an Aquos
something something.  I am using my Macbook from more than a couple
years ago, perhaps 5 years (therefore 50 laptop-years).  I got a
new backpack with wheels and a hard plastic cover for my computer.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not been wearing shoes in Tokyo for 8 years now.  That is 1
year more than I was barefoot in Houston.  That&rsquo;s a strange thought
for me.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I still do not have kids, but we have our cat Jennie, who
is maybe 5 years old.  6?  Lin still likes to keep Jennie inside
at night, even though Jennie climbs around on Lin&rsquo;s head at night,
meowing (to be let outside, I think).</p></li>

<li><p>I have started taking walks in the morning, though I did not walk
the past couple of days.  Tomorrow I will walk for sure!  I walk
for about an hour, trying to find a new street or new area I have
not previously seen.  This search has turned up a pizza place, a
hidden grave yard, a brick fish tank, and a nice path along the
nearby recycling center.</p></li>

<li><p>I have started eating less, and for shorter durations during the
day.  Lin is interested in doing similarly as a <em>concept</em>, but not
always interested in doing it in <em>practice</em>.  I have been hearing
more and more about intermittant fasting and its benefits.  Most
recently, I heard that it&rsquo;s good to eat only during a 10 hour
window each day.  I am not quite there yet, but close.</p></li>

<li><p>I am headed to Akabanebashi now for IL lesson.  Then walk to Nishi
Azabu for UG lesson featuring Akari, Emi, Kazu, Kenji, Masa,
Ryuya, Shinji, and Taka (in ABC order).</p></li>

<li><p>It looks like co-gender group will not happen tonight.</p></li>

<li><p>Just arrived in Shinjuku.  Changing trains now.</p></li>

<li><p>Oh, that reminds me, I have been keeping track of my finances,
down to the yen, since July of this year.</p></li>

<li>It&rsquo;s hotter in Tokyo this summer than summers in my memory.  It&rsquo;s
been getting up to 34 - 35 degrees Celcius as the high, with some hot spots
in the 40s</li>
<li>I bought <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">https://www.marbletrack3.com/</a> and have got a reasonable
start on how to display each livestream as an episode.  I started
making a page for each character, calling them workers, and even
got some translation support from Tomoko at Showspace in SCC.</li>
<li>Regarding the translation for marbletrack3.com, I only have done
the menus, and even just that is done poorly (links are still
broken)</li>
<li>But the site is open source so I can hopefully get some help from
people on <a href="https://gohugo.io">https://gohugo.io</a></li>
<li>Speaking of open source, for ConSwi programming, I often get stuck
on questions that are difficult to explain unless I can show the
source code.  I want to go back to open sourcing the code, and just
worry about how to open source the code, but not the images.</li>
<li>Lin and I have a new bed frame but no bed.  The bed apparently did
not fit up the stairwell, but I was not there to witness it.</li>
<li>My backpack needs some more mending.  I plan to work on it later today.</li>
<li>Also later today: Meet Cathy The Relationship Artist at 5pm, have
GG lesson in Akihabara at 6:30pm, head home for Japanese lesson at
10pm, finish right on time for English lesson with Aki&rsquo;s friend Y
at 11pm.</li>
<li>I have realized that I need support promoting the men&rsquo;s circle; I
don&rsquo;t really write on FB to invite people nor even announce
upcoming interesting presentations, etc.</li>
<li>I may have found the backpack that will replace the backpack I
have had for a while and have kept repairing as it rips in various
places.</li>

<li>Dreamhost has decided to stop supporting catch-all emails so I am
looking for a new provider.  The encrypted versions cannot search

<ol>
<li>Still have my MacBook Pro, like 4 or 5 years old now</li>
<li>Lin and I have lived in our house for 2 years yay</li>
<li>Jennie is good and has a cat door so she can come in and go out on
her own schedule</li>
<li>I have been talking to Kristen via Marco Polo recently</li>
<li>I have not been talking to Richard via Marco Polo recently.</li>
<li>Just met T from AB to figure out the next priorities for the
site.  Good meeting, and good to meet with them regularly.</li>
<li>I applied to &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; a symphony orchestra for some event at Muza
on July 1st.  Will find out around 15 June if I got it.</li>
<li>Still have not made any more LINE stickers beyond the first two I
made for Jennie, including &ldquo;Jennie says what&rdquo; which is no longer
for sale (Lin did not like one of the pictures) and &ldquo;Jennie says
yeah&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maybe I will make &ldquo;Jennie says Tomoko&rdquo; and have the name Tomoko
written in various ways around Jennie posed in various ways.</li>
<li>Monday noon lessons at U in Nishi-Azabu are getting better; I seem
to have found a good groove with the students.</li>
<li>dev on ConSwi for Godot has stalled in past couple of weeks. ugh.</li>
<li>Co-gender group meets on Mondays and men&rsquo;s circle meets on
Tuesdays (since early 2018)</li>
<li>I have been studying on Thursday nights with Mel in Chicago for a while.</li>
<li>I have been teaching on Sunday nights with Sarumama near Shinjuku
for a much longer while.</li>
<li>Last week I had a meeting with Michael in UK to talk about ways to create a
program for corporate team building.</li>
<li>Been going to SOGO each Sunday, and Lin&rsquo;s friend Aki has started
to come as well.  She has attended twice in past two weeks and
seems keen to continue.</li>
<li>She asked Junyu how to get more physically fit; he talked for 15
or so minutes in Japanese and I understood 80 or 90 percent.</li>
<li>I could probably say 5% or 10%</li>
<li>I have been using my waterproof Aquos phone for a while..  maybe 2
years</li>
<li>M$ is going to buy Github, which is good for the Github peeps I
guess, but likely bad for open source.  I will move my junk off to
something else.  Maybe.  Fred recently installed Gitlab on one of
his servers.  Maybe I can use it.</li>
<li>Each Monday I have been chilling in Saizeria between Nishi-Azabu
lesson and co-gender circle.  Time to head to co-gender circle soon.</li>

<li>I sent my invoice to Nate on time this month.</li>
<li>He&rsquo;s trying to cut costs by moving our Redmine server to a new server</li>
<li>Nate: &ldquo;This is an internal work and I don’t feel it’s fair for me to pay the cost to figure out how to move to amazon don’t U thjnk?&rdquo;</li>
<li>I am paid hourly, not a salary.</li>
<li>Tariq and I have been working on ConSwi.  I keep wondering if we should opensource it.</li>
<li>Tonight is the first Tuesday of the month, so new men are welcome to attend Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle.  A few have said they will come, but I always wonder how many will.</li>
<li>This is the second month of inviting new men this way.</li>
<li>I am about 90% through Brené Brown&rsquo;s book about being imperfect (I forgot the name haha)</li>
<li>I am about 30% through Brandon Peele&rsquo;s book about finding our purpose in life.</li>
<li>I am about 1% through with Marble Track 3.</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 is now into its tenth minute or so.  There is a bit of trouble at the three-way split; the small marbles have <em>barely</em> enough room to roll through the rhombus under the bamboo splitters.  I may have to lift one of the chopsticks</li>
<li>Back to barefoot every day because the weather is nice.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s Golden Week now, so we basically have the week off.</li>
<li>Haven&rsquo;t really talked to Fred as often as I&rsquo;d like.  I gotta call that lil bro a bit more.</li>
<li>Maybe I can get him on Marco Polo</li>
<li>I finished Dots and Co&rsquo;s first 550 levels and am &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; for more.</li>
<li>Been studying Japanese each Thursday with Mel in Chicago.</li>
<li>Been teaching English each Sunday with Mutsumi in Tokyo.</li>
<li>Been teaching English at SCC every other week on Wednesdays and Thursdays.</li>
<li>Been teaching English at JB on Wednesdays</li>
<li>Been teaching for ist on Mondays in Akabanebashi</li>
<li>Starting Monday will be teaching for Tess again on Mondays in Nishi Azabu</li>
<li>co-gender group meets on Mondays from 7-9pm in Nishi Azabu. (but not yesterday for Golden Week)</li>
<li>Tokyo men&rsquo;s circle meets on Tuesdays from 7-9pm in Hiroo.</li>
<li>I have found that by reading Japanese, that has been the most helpful for me to learn.</li>
<li>That and speaking</li>
<li>Speaking of speaking, I have re-started working on Soness&rsquo;s Build Your Speaker Bio and Media Sheet.  It&rsquo;s good stuff.</li>
<li>I was too late to attend Toastmaster&rsquo;s last month so will try again this month, being careful to leave on time!</li>
<li>I should probably send a link to my contact and make sure I have the right place.</li>
<li>I recently started messing with Fossil to archive my journal, but ain&rsquo;t using it consistently.  Sorta kinda stopped, tbh</li>
<li>I rarely use abbreviations while writing, except for contractions
and whatever it&rsquo;s called when writin&rsquo; an apostrophe instead of a
g.</li>
<li>5pm.  Gotta start going to Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle.</li>
<li>22:40pm  Great circle tonight, with one new man joining (out of 3 who said they would, and 3 others who said they might).</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been doing pushups and planks on a semi-regular basis.</li>
<li>After reading <a href="https://jamesclear.com/habits">Habits by James Clear</a>, I have some new ideas about how to build new habits. The cycle of habit forming is interesting, but the habits based on personality is even more interesting.  Instead of &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t buy junk food,&rdquo; try &ldquo;I am a person who eats healthily&rdquo;</li>
<li>Lin and I are scheduled to go do something tomorrow; I wonder what we will end up doing.</li>
<li>I wonder if gravity is part of electromagnetism.  Magnets attract over distance; gravity attracts over distance.  Electromagnetic radiation and gravity both propogate at the same speed.  Hmmm.</li>
<li>(next day)  I just spent 49 minutes redoing a single piece on Marble Track 3, and am really happy with the result.</li>

<ol>
<li>I started a Meetup group
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/">ManKind Project Tokyo</a>
which will soon be linked to the Mankind Project Pro Meetup
account.</li>
<li>Men&rsquo;s group meetings are now every Tuesday (since March).  We had
been meeting twice a month since about August 2015.  The group has
slowly grown and now twice a month is not enough for every man to
do his work.</li>
<li>SOGO is still going, although the leadership is changing.  Menya
was not there today; Maha will soon be moving to Ireland; Michael
left for California last year.  Good job Pinakesh and Sho for
leading the group today!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has a grand total of nearly 9 minutes of video.  As
of this moment, the stage is spinning 4 units per frame (pretty
fast) and some characters are affected, but ghostable gluer is not
affected.</li>
<li>I work for JB primarily (Wednesdays and Thursdays in Kawasaki +
Akihabara) Solid Square early Wednesday mornings, from which Chika
has moved on; SCC Wednesday / Thursday afternoons, both for museum
and showspace; JB head office on Wednesday afternoon+evenings for
kids classes alongside Patrick, and adult lessons alongside Matt;
then GG lesson in Akihabara on Thursdays.</li>
<li>After GG on Thursdays I head home for Japanese lesson with Mel in
Chicago, who has free time after getting her son off to school on
their Thursday morning.</li>
<li>Secondarily working for ist with Tariq, with lessons on Monday
mornings.  We had a lot of students up to the end of the year last
year, but they pretty much bounced during the holidays.</li>
<li>Also working for ist on ConSwi, a new game we are developing
<em>slowly</em> but surely with <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot 3</a>.  I am
scheduled to meet Tariq this afternoon in 武蔵小杉 station.</li>
<li>Also working for Tess, with one lesson per week on Mondays around
noon.  Not sure if that will be continued after the next two
lessons coming up in April.</li>
<li>Also working on growing the men&rsquo;s group and hope to figure out a
way to bring enough value to businesses that I can make some money
with it.  For now it is all volunteer.</li>
<li>And volunteering a couple times a month on
<a href="https://www.7cups.com/">7 Cups</a>, etc.</li>
<li>I just received in the mail
<em>Sacred Circles</em> by Robin Deen Carnes and Sally Craig,
<em>The Gifts of Imperfection</em> by Brené Brown, and
<em>Planet on Purpose</em> by Brandon Peele.</li>
<li>Fred got his PhD! in December (I think).  He&rsquo;s teaching C++
courses.</li>
<li>Lin and I have our cat Jennie and live in our house near (ahem, 24
minutes walk from) 新百合ヶ丘 station.</li>
<li>I recently bought a Crayon Shinchan book, and a Doraemon book, but
they are kinda beyond my understanding, unless I go slowly.</li>
<li>I am still using my last ever Macbook Pro.</li>
<li>I got rid of my iPhone and now use a waterproof Android phone,
(which was waterproof before any iPhones were waterproof.)</li>
<li>running out of steam in this SOML.</li>
<li>Oh, I have been using <a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a> to get stuff done.  It is
thanks to Complice that I remembered I need to write an SOML today.</li>

<li>I am training to work at Ty&rsquo;s (headed there now)</li>
<li>I have been transferring the CB backend to SB, where it will be
streamlined / focused on artists and their events instead of
artists and their products.</li>
<li>It has been over a year since I first considered giving up this
laptop for one on which I can run Ubuntu.</li>
<li>The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about this laptop now is the lack of
battery.</li>
<li>I meditated standing up this morning and last night.  By standing,
I was able to remain awake.</li>
<li>I just noticed the funny looking panel (featuring a guy in a yellow
suit) on the train has expanded to
two panels.  I guess it is some kinda campaign.</li>
<li>I have started taking Japanese lessons with Mel who&rsquo;s a native
Japanese speaker who&rsquo;s been willing to look at my homework between
lessons, and whose English is pretty darn good, being that she
lives in the US (and apparently tried hard to learn).</li>
<li>I have gotten positive feedback regarding being a good listener.</li>
<li>I have started doing counseling in my free time before teaching in
西麻布（にしあざぶ）</li>
<li>Lin has been out of town for two nights to see Mikako in 新潟.  I
was planning to go but prep for Ty and sb kept me here.</li>
<li>The owner of Christine&rsquo;s apartment has offered to replace the
carpet with flooring due to some kind of issue they were having
with it.</li>
<li>I used an old envelope I had had with an alpaca / llama sticker on
it to repay people who helped me the day I left my wallet at home.</li>
<li>I have been guiding my thinking with the underlying trust in the
idea &ldquo;the spirit world is real,&rdquo; which I have been hearing more
and more from people I have (casually) interviewed about their
ayajuasca experiences.</li>
<li>I will be taking a course with Soness soon.  She will help me
clarify my message regarding men&rsquo;s group work and personal growth
work in general.</li>
<li>I just learned the first names of けいこさん and さっちゃん
(short for さちこさん), two women who work in a news/snack stand
in the middle of a platform.  They had asked me last week about
being barefoot, and apparently didn&rsquo;t recognized me this week
until they noticed my bare feet.</li>
<li>I just heard a little 4 year old boy refer to himself using 俺（お
れ）, which I still don&rsquo;t use because I think my Japanese isn&rsquo;t
good enough.</li>
<li>日本語を書けますけど、今度これを読めますか？</li>
<li>I am beginning to try reading Japanese paragraphs, but the kanji
still gets me.  I probably can read 200 or so kanji and write 100
or so kanji.</li>
<li>I want to work on open source projects instead of all closed
source stuff.  Welll to be more clear, I want to work on more open
source projects for which I&rsquo;m the maintainer.  I have contributed
to some open source projects, but &hellip; Wait. even as I write this, I
realize I am misrepresenting the situation. I want to be able to
post code / ask questions without having to ask / cleanse the code
first.</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 is pretty open source, but it&rsquo;s hardware, and one
of a kind that will be pretty hard to duplicate.  I did not put a
password on the images, but have not yet figured out how (to
explain how) people can download the images.</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has entered its fifth month of development (not
including making the cage/barrier to keep Jennie out). I think I
have worked 4.8 days on it, according to the livestreams I have on Youtube.</li>
<li>Just left Noborito.  Gonna change trains at the next station.
Peace out and see ya later, computer.</li>
