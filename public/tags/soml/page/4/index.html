<h2 id="22-01-tuesday-20-september-2016-jst">22:01 Tuesday 20 September 2016 JST</h2>

<p>Great fun at Suns Out Guns Out on Sunday.  It was a bit rainy, but I&rsquo;m
waterpoof so it was just fine.  We worked out for 90 minutes then had
lunch then played ultimate for a while.  Great great great!  I brought
my new purple disc and it got its first scuffs on Sunday.</p>

<p>The next day boom I felt sick.  I thought I was just sore from workout
but I had a bit of a fever.  Fortunately my Monday morning lesson had
been moved to today due to holiday yesterday.  Unfortunately, we ended
up cancelling I-group due to not enough people attending.</p>

<p>I pretty much slept all day and all night and felt pretty much better
this morning for morning lesson near Akabanebashi station.</p>

<p>Went back home and slept some hours before lessons tonight.</p>

<p>As I left the house, Jennie bolted out the door despite the little
fact that it was raining.  Aw man, and no one home to let her back in
when she realizes how much fun it isn&rsquo;t to be cold and wet.  Hopefully
she&rsquo;ll be okay.</p>

<p>Fred got his Minecraft account set up and I directed him to
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deltaminecraft">Delta</a>.  We may play tonight
if I can get home in time.</p>

<p>Actually as I write this, I&rsquo;m on the local train, specifically because
I wanted to sit down to write a bit in my journal.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a good start on moving all my websites&rsquo; content to their
own new users, but a couple of them are broken; specifically
robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.pl doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.  I guess it&rsquo;s
because not all the files got copied over.  I think it used some files
that were outside the webroot, so didn&rsquo;t get copied when Dreamhost
moved all robnugen.com&rsquo;s files over to new user.</p>

<p>Mayumi gave me a new puzzle recently.  It&rsquo;s Hanayama&rsquo;s Vortex: three
chrome plated cast iron pieces which fit together in a kindof spiral
shape.  She gave me the puzzle pieces all separated and I refused to
accept the answer sheet from her.  I figured out what it must look
like when finished, but I haven&rsquo;t yet figured out how to get them
together.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll work on it a bit now.</p>

<h2 id="19-00-friday-19-august-2016-jst">19:00 Friday 19 August 2016 JST</h2>

<ol>
<li>been a while since I&rsquo;ve done a state of my life address</li>
<li>Lin and I have been married for 5 years</li>
<li>We live in Higashi Yurigaoka, and regularly use Shin Yurigaoka station</li>
<li>We just had a party the other day for our house warming.  We&rsquo;ve lived in the house since June 2nd of this year.</li>
<li>For Obon we went to Umi-no-koen on Seaside Line.  The water was warm and filled with seaweed.  Wind was quite blowy, making for a sandblasted walk back to the wooded area.</li>
<li>On that day, I forgot my sandals, so ended up buying new sandals before going to work.  Got new slacks too because the ones I had selected had a rip in the crotch.</li>
<li>I still work for JB teaching English, and AB and  CB doing websites.</li>
<li>Nate is supposed to have sent a template and instructions for a new single page site, but it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</li>
<li>Jennie was bitten by some animal over a month ago, and still has pus oozing from the hole in her neck.  The vet has had her on antibiotics, and it&rsquo;s slowly getting better, but dang.</li>
<li>As a result, we don&rsquo;t let Jennie outside.  I&rsquo;d love to let her outside but Lin has been convinced that it&rsquo;s better for Jennie to lead a long boring less-expensive life than to lead and exciting life running around outside fighting infectious animals and requiring vet visits.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty good at popping pills into her mouth behind her tongue so she has to swallow them.</li>
<li>Recently saw Kan speak; it was my second time to attend one of his events.</li>
<li>He talked about completely different stuff this time, which is apparently the case every time.</li>
<li>I left my green yoga mat at the restaurant after the Kan event and Rohini has it now.</li>
<li>Last week was a holiday, but Y from GG still requested a lesson at the normal lesson time.</li>
<li>Might start doing private lessons with her, but not sure yet.</li>
<li>MM lessons are now just M lessons unless SP comes.</li>
<li>No longer doing SS lessons; they said they were busy. bummer</li>
<li>Also teaching a lesson on Mondays for Tariq.</li>
<li>In art department, I&rsquo;ve been drawing regularly.  Just presented Toshie with her piece, with her name hidden in the drawing.</li>
<li>I alos just finished my first set of 25 little pieces.  The first several were all drawn based on the previous one (except the very first) and ones after that were drawn from memory based on what I had been drawing..  so they&rsquo;re like a game of telephone  in that the picture slightly changed over time.</li>
<li>My art is visible on my wiki, available via shortlink <a href="https://art.robnugen.com/art">https://art.robnugen.com/art</a> but I want to make it also available via <a href="https://art.robnugen.com/">https://art.robnugen.com/</a> (which is currently my URL shortener gui).  It&rsquo;s probably an easy tweak, but I just gotta get into the code.  Prolly the hardest thing is thinking of a path that I&rsquo;ll remember later, but not need for art, ever.  Maybe <a href="https://art.robnugen.com/shortener">https://art.robnugen.com/shortener</a></li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a metric ton of old journal entries that are lost in date 0000-01-01 because either the YAML headers are fucked or missing and Hugo doesn&rsquo;t know how to parse the date unless it&rsquo;s in this format: 2016-08-19T19:00:12+09:00</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still using my old backpack even though the other side is beginning to rip.  Need to sew that shit up.</li>
<li>I rearranged my room after Lin kept offering to help and asking if I&rsquo;d do it.  I like it better now.  Thank you babychan!!</li>
<li>In my new room arrangement, I can more easily reach my printer.</li>
<li>Today I had my Tuesday meeting with CB via skype from Kawasaki because they were off on Tuesday.  I did the meeting from Wired Cafe, while using their wifi.  Finished the meeting and oops no cash to pay for lunch.  Good thing they accept Suica (debit card originally used for trains and buses).</li>
<li>Went to conveni on the way to work and they were like, &ldquo;your Suica has only 91 yen&rdquo; though the drink was 140 yen.  Dang.  Fortunately I had store credit on my loyalty card (1.5% back on purchases) so had enough credit to by the drink.</li>
<li>Explained to Hashimoto-san why I couldn&rsquo;t buy bananas, so they gave me a hand of bananas on credit.  So sweet!</li>
<li>On the way home I stopped by the bank to get cash out so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to walk home or something ridiculous like that.</li>
<li>Still walking everywhere barefoot.  On the train as well, and bus, and shopping..  everywhere except when I go to work at a company that expects people to wear shoes, of all things.  I think I&rsquo;ve been at it going on 6 years in Japan, though I wasn&rsquo;t totally consistent when I started 6 years ago.  I&rsquo;m counting it as 1 year longer than when Lin and I got married, because..  well I was in Thailand before that; maybe I should peg it at the time we got married; it won&rsquo;t be overstating it.  But who cares?  dang.  6 years what are you gonna do about it?</li>
<li>Just chatted with Sally today; she&rsquo;s doing well and went to the trampoline place where Fred and I went in January, but there were too many young kids (sum sum summertime summer time) for her to feel comfortable jumping without double-bounce-launching them to dangerous heights.  aww man!!  bummer.</li>
<li>Arriving in Noborito soon.  Gotta change trains from Nambu Line to Odakyu Line.  We live on Odakyu Line now!  How weird is that?</li>
<li>Been studying Japanese with Yuri about 3 times per week. Some people have said my speaking is getting better.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve nearly nearly completed my dig on Delta (Minecraft server).  I dug a tunnel down to level 10 or so and then dug a large hole around the staircase, leaving a tube staircase in the middle.</li>
<li>Tokyo I-group meets every other Monday, including this coming Monday, in Hiroo from 6pm to 8pm.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be staffing in Perth again in October 2016; it will be my second time to staff there, and my 3rd staffing overall.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m also attending an e-I-group via Zoom each week on Thursdays Tokyo time.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve posted several (a dozen?) pieces of art on <a href="https://www.stellartisan.com/vendor/rob-nugen-colorful-lines-on-shikishi76105ACE">Stellartisan</a></li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve switched from Reddit to Hacker News as my first stop online as it&rsquo;s more focused on stuff I care about instead of memes and shit.  Granted, I did subscribe to several dumb subreddits.</li>
<li>Been digging through Ansible tutorials; basically want to automate deployment of servers I have on AWS.  Been slowing getting stuff figured out.</li>
<li>Recently found a great set of videos <a href="https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/43-19-minutes-with-ansible-part-1-4">Learning Ansible with Vagrant</a></li>
<li>I call Fred every night at 11pm, which is currently 9am in Austin.  Need to get his ass up and working on his thesis!  Hopefully he&rsquo;ll have it done before the time changes in September.</li>
<li>We are having a cute little earthquake.  I wonder how big it will be.  Still shaking a bit as I write.</li>
<li>It wasn&rsquo;t so big here, but apparently about <a href="https://www.jma.go.jp/en/quake/20160819211049392-192107.html">5.4 in Ibaraki</a>. <a href="https://archive.is/Hp4On">https://archive.is/Hp4On</a></li>

<p>Wow cinco de mayo!</p>

<p>Today is the third holiday in a row of Golden Week; during which I
have not needed to go to work.  I&rsquo;m just going to ignore the little
detail that I went to an empty classroom on Tuesday; derp.</p>

<p>Today I discovered freeCodeCamp, and have just finished exercise 253.  (most of the first ones were sooper easy.)</p>

<p>I used
<a href="https://goo.gl/k7Q7UQ">.reduce() to find the longest word in a sentence</a></p>

<p>We had 3 men in I-group this past Monday, and 3 men absent&hellip; so 6 all
together!  That&rsquo;s great; we&rsquo;re up 100% since August.  Yay!</p>

<p>And now I just used
<a href="https://goo.gl/fq4rEU">.map() and .reduce() to do this</a>.  Thank you
Travis, for having explained how they work that time while we were
walking to the restaurant you liked.</p>

<li>I gave Lin her first 1 hour massage from me.  She&rsquo;s due for 15 this
year, according to the massage coupon I gave her.  She thinks I
should start doing massages for real, and I enjoyed it enough to
consider the same thing.</li>
<li>We applied to buy our new house in 新百合ケ丘!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m enjoying doing lessons on <a href="https://acloud.guru/">https://acloud.guru/</a></li>
<li>I still have my black iPhone 4S, though I will &ldquo;soon&rdquo; &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; to
Lin&rsquo;s 5S.</li>
<li>I added a pic of me, fred, lin at the skydiving place onto the wall
in my main room of the minecraft server I&rsquo;ve been making for Fred.</li>
<li>I installed <a href="https://mountainduck.io/">Mountain Duck</a> which makes
it easy to copy images to my server, but hard to get image URLs
for those images on my server.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve applied to be a (foot) model on streamen (NSFW), but not yet been approved.</li>
<li>I plan to draw for 1 hour 3 days per week, do MOOV exercises 3 days
per week&hellip; hmm this is still phrased in terms that require <strong>will
power</strong>, so maybe I should tweak it a bit.</li>

<h2 id="18-59-friday-06-november-2015-jst">18:59 Friday 06 November 2015 JST</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>As I write this, I&rsquo;m going the long way home around the Yamanote
Line; I just sat down at Shinjuku station, and I plan to switch to
the Keihin Tohoku Line in Ueno or somewhere convenient.</p></li>

<li><p>Have had a few tickets stacking up for AB and CB websites, but on 1
November, I released version 2.0.0 of both the frontend and backend
of the AB website.  It uses a new system for logins which allows
the login to be decoubpled from the persona using the site.  Soon,
different &ldquo;types&rdquo; of users will be able to log in.</p></li>

<li><p>CB site has requested a few changes as part of their low-key
redesign. Basically they want to redo the entire site, but I don&rsquo;t
know how to design well enough to do it, so we&rsquo;re doing it kinda
piecemeal.  16 November will be the next visible change.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I have started thinking about buying land &ldquo;out in the
country.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m happy to do it just as an investment; I imagine its value
will appreciate more quickly than if the money just rots in the
bank.  Lin has a bit more practical aspirations, so somewhere in
between we&rsquo;ll probably get a house that&rsquo;s not too far out and can
be &ldquo;fixed up&rdquo; in a reasonable amount of time, whatever that means.</p></li>

<li><p>I drew a vision board-ish thing showing the land we&rsquo;d like to buy,
featuring a stream and some adjacent open land on which MKP
trainings can be held.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been in touch with a guy in the US who&rsquo;s starting an import
business, so in a way I&rsquo;m starting an export business.  No one has
profited yet except the post office and convenience store where I
paid for shipping within Japan, but it&rsquo;s still a fun project for
now.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve not been studying Japanese recently, but I sorta kinda have
considered possibly starting again.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve not been drawing mazes recently, and I haven&rsquo;t really
considered starting again as much as I&rsquo;ve thought about studying
Japanese again.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve started drawing images again.  It takes a bit of effort to
create all the meta data: posting them to my wiki, my URL
shortener, and Patreon, but it&rsquo;s still pretty fun.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently bought some new markers, but haven&rsquo;t used them yet!
Hopefully I will like the colors.</p>

<p><a href="/images/art/supplies/markers_2015-11-06_21.55.20.jpg"><img src="/images/art/supplies/thumbs/markers_2015-11-06_21.55.20.jpg" alt="markers" /></a></p></li>

<li><p>I sent Fred&rsquo;s 2016 journal today.  He likes that late nights and
weekend days get ample space for entries.</p></li>

<li><p>I may start teaching lessons on Friday night; it&rsquo;s for a single
semester if in fact they decide to start.  Trial lesson is next
week or something.</p></li>

<li><p>Ted has started coming back into the house, but he hasn&rsquo;t yet
stayed inside with the door closed.  He regularly comes in to eat,
snoop around the house a bit, and go back out.  We could close the
door while he&rsquo;s in snooping mode, but I want him to feel
comfortable that he can go back out.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin has been working lots at work, and I often don&rsquo;t see her until
10pm at night.  She enjoys the work, using English while helping
her clients, and getting to see lots of different houses.</p></li>

<li><p>We recently bought a Dyson vacuum cleaner, which is battery
operated, and lighter than our previous plug-in version.  It&rsquo;s
pretty neat, and has their signature clear dust catcher in which
all the dander has a party before heading on a new adventure.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m planning to give Lin a massage coupon which says something
like <em>2016 Special Massage Coupon</em>, and has a checkbox by each
month of the year, plus an extra checkbox in March for her
birthday, and July for our anniversary.  Don&rsquo;t tell her.</p></li>

<li><p>Also planning to get her Harrod&rsquo;s Bears for 2011 and 2015, to
bookend the three she has already.  Don&rsquo;t tell her.</p></li>

<li><p>Pop Pop Chaos features variable pricing for bubbles!  There are
about 600 blue bubbles now, and they cost about 700 points to make
new ones.  There are approximately 0 green bubbles now, and
whoever logs in can <em>gain</em> points for creating new ones.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve kinda mussed up user thunderrabbit on the game though; I
hyper-clicked to create blue bubbles and laughed as Meteor didn&rsquo;t
keep up with my clicks, allowing me to go past my point credit
limit.  Then it caught up and I&rsquo;m in the red like 75000 points.  Dang.</p></li>

<li><p>My plan to meet Lin tonight worked!  I&rsquo;ve just switched to
Keihin-Tohoku line in Ueno (by simply walking across the
platform), chose one of the plentiful seats, and will arrive in
Kawasaki around the same time as Lin so we can have a nice date!</p></li>

<li><p>Tariq and I have been working on an app for Apple TV; it&rsquo;s sorta
kinda almost finished, though I still need to work out a couple of
bits that I&rsquo;m not sure how to do.  It basically presents 140
business vocabulary words which are the most commonly used + most
commonly unknown by his students.  Tariq has worked for 10 years
compiling the list, so it&rsquo;s certainly valuable!</p></li>

<li><p>Tokyo I-group will have its first open meeting on Monday November
16th in Hiroo from 6pm - 8pm.  One of my mates from Japan will
join us; I&rsquo;m optimistic he will benefit from the work and attend
regularly.</p></li>

<li><p>This coming Saturday Lin and I will be going to a Reiki share in
Asakusa.  Oh maybe while we&rsquo;re in the area we can get some good
prezzies for people in the US for belated Christmas.</p></li>

<li><p>While in Texas, Lin and I plan to go skydiving, eat steak, and get
officially married in the US!  Might even get a driver&rsquo;s license
for me, cause they cost $3000 in Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>Haha I just realized this is the second time I&rsquo;ve been in
Hamamatsucho today.  First time was for a lesson, and I left on
Yamanote Line; this time is just passing through on Keihin Tohoku
Line.</p></li>

<li><p>At the toy store I visit each week before MM lesson, I found an
intricate maze puzzle had been broken with a bit of brute force,
probably applied by an over enthusiastic person.  The store
employees were like, &ldquo;welp, you can have it!&rdquo; and I was like,
&ldquo;yay!&rdquo; cause I fixed it in about an hour (not counting time to let
the glue dry), and it&rsquo;s perfect now.  Retail price 5800 yen or so.</p></li>

<li><p>I should show the maze to Travis before taking it to the US.  It&rsquo;s
basically the same architecture as he suggested once, but with one
extra, um, twist.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of Travis, I left my neobbbbium magnets at his house a
couple weeks ago when we went for a visit to see them and Johan,
Matt, and Claire.  Maybe we can arrange for a swap; I&rsquo;ll show him
the maze (before taking it to Fred in the US) in exchange for the
magnets.  (not that they&rsquo;re being held hostage)</p></li>

<li><p>In Minecraft, I <code>/sethome</code> in a cave under a lava-soaked
mountain.  I immediately dug a staircase down to level 10 or so,
and have been digging a &ldquo;huge&rdquo; hole around the staircase, just
because it&rsquo;s funny.  Man, what a waste of time.</p>

<p>I need to somehow convince myself to spend as much time drawing in
real life as I do digging in Minecraft.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I have been eating much(!) more healthily for &hellip; a week
now.</p></li>

<li><p>For the past three weeks, I have joined an online I-group on
Thursday mornings, Tokyo time.  I guess at a basic level it
amounts to life coaching and holding each other accountable for
achieving our individual personal goals.</p></li>

<li><p>Yesterday in Kamata, I taught three (3) lessons, featuring a total
of 8 young students between ages 6 and 11.  The best thing is that
in the nearby convenience store, I found my <em>favorite</em> candy bars
still available!  I saw them &ldquo;everywhere&rdquo; for a while, but then
stopped seeing them.. It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re no longer being
produced. boooo</p></li>

<li><p>Still haven&rsquo;t really nailed down our plans for the US.  It&rsquo;s kinda
weird to have things to do during vacation; how can I plan shit if
I have no idea what other fun things will be available?</p></li>

<li><p>In general, I&rsquo;m teaching 6 lesson hours per week, programming
about 25 hours per week, most of which is done at home with the
cats catting around the balcony door.</p></li>

<li><p>Arriving in Kawasaki now; see ya in a sec while I chill out at the
clock to wait for Lin.</p></li>

<li><p>I did <em>not</em> end up buying a new computer a few months ago when I
was preparing for this one to go to the shop for its
end-of-warranty checkup.  So, I&rsquo;m still using my MacBook Pro,
which is now about 3+ years old, I guess.  I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve
made an entry for it in my <code>Items:</code> category on my wiki.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m still using my iPhone 4S, with iOS 7.1 or so.  The lastest
models are iPhone 6S and iOS 9 or so.  I&rsquo;m sorta-kinda looking for
a replacement phone; I will almost certainly go with Android.</p>

<p>BUT, I don&rsquo;t really want to give up this phone since I have an
uncapped unlimited data plan for a fixed price.  That plan is
apparently no longer available, so I&rsquo;m sure that when I switch
phones, they&rsquo;ll force me to pay for a different plan.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve recently purchased unlimited encrypted storage on SpiderOak,
for $149 per year.  It sounds great, but I don&rsquo;t see a way to just
toss data on their servers without it <em>also</em> residing on my device
here.  I guess if I have N computers, I can store all of their
data separately; .. hmm maybe I&rsquo;ll try to install a SpiderOak
client on my not-really-used Ubuntu machine which is essentially
just wasting away on my desk.  (it&rsquo;s the one I got as a possible
(interim) replacement for this machine.)</p></li>

<li><p>I need to pee, but Lin&rsquo;s about to arrive in about 2 minutes haha</p></li>

<li><p>Recently Hideo sent me an email with dates of a clinical trial in
January, but we&rsquo;ll be in the US.  I guess I won&rsquo;t be going down
there again unless they have trials with an age limit above 45!</p></li>

<li><p>I recently took apart a little ionizer thing that Lin said didn&rsquo;t
work anymore.  I extracted its squirrel cage blower (did someone
say generator??) and may play with it, but it&rsquo;s pretty low
priority now.</p></li>

<li><p>I gave blood a bit more than three months ago, so I&rsquo;ve just added
an alarm to remind me to give blood again soon.</p></li>

<h2 id="19-01-tuesday-08-september-2015-jst">19:01 Tuesday 08 September 2015 JST</h2>

<ol>
<li>Maybe the biggest overall thing, which I <em>hope</em> will become a big
thing in the future: In October, I&rsquo;m going to staff a NWTA in
Perth, with other men from <a href="https://mkp.org">https://mkp.org</a></li>
<li>I have my plane tickets and all other costs are covered cause I&rsquo;m
coming from overseas.</li>
<li>I just bought a soft plastic stackable brick toy set for Lin&rsquo;s
clients&rsquo; son&rsquo;s enjoyment. PolyM, Art.-No. 73061 Helicopter, after
having been given the chance to play with a big box of the bricks
to make &ldquo;anything,&rdquo; so long as it fit on the shelf here next to
まい&rsquo;s creations.  I guess she was all created-out after making a
few different displays with the bricks.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t take a picture of my creation, but it was kindof round;
the pieces are soft-ish and more forgiving than LEGO, both for
construction and trodding with bare feet!  I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re also
far less durable, but oh well.</li>
<li>Today I saw a note that c0de is stepping down from his many years
of hosting DELTA minecraft server.  I thanked him for his hard
work, and he&rsquo;ll certainly be missed!  (not that it will affect me
at this juncture; I haven&rsquo;t logged on to the server in months)</li>
<li>Today at work I helped Satomi fix her /etc/hosts file to reconnect
to a website which inexplicably has had its DNS misconfigured. I
mean how hard can it be?  I said, &ldquo;it should have the same IP
address as (ABC site),&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s still not fixed.</li>
<li>Mutsumi has retired from lessons for the time being.  He said he&rsquo;s
busy.  No, not Mutsumi!  The <em>other</em> Mutsumi!  Happily, Mutsumi&rsquo;s
still attending, and I&rsquo;m thankful for her hard work, both at study
and looking for other students to fill Mutsumi&rsquo;s place!</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t gone to Japanese class for months(?)</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t drawn a maze for a month?</li>
<li>BUT, Pop Pop Chaos is coming along pretty well.  I am sorta-close
to having rolling high score list implemented, but I just need to
deal with user&rsquo;s names having been stored in different locations
based on how they logged in (via U/P or Oauth).  Bubbles grow when
clicked, the turn dark in proportion to how close they are to
popping, and people reach the high score list based not on points,
but on <em>creates</em>, which require points to obtain.  I&rsquo;m pretty happy
with it so far.</li>
<li>The GG lesson used to be M, T, and Te, but now it&rsquo;s going to be
just M and Te.  And only for 1 hour instead of an hour an a half.
Boo, but still better than a big bowl of nothin&rsquo;.  Only problem is
M tends to speak more than Te, so I want to be careful to make sure
Te has enough talk time.</li>
<li>Had a new student today in other class (via Tariq); he&rsquo;ll join for
two months, which is perfect because C has said she&rsquo;ll be busy for
2 months.  She will hopefully enjoy slightly easier lessons than
what I had been doing to challege her before the new student
joined.</li>
<li></li>

<li>I recently received two Dell laptops.  One had Windows 7 on it, so I&rsquo;ve left that.  The other had no hard drive, so I bought a new 700GB drive and put Debian on it.  It didn&rsquo;t have wifi, so I bought a USB nano wifi dongle.  Still couldn&rsquo;t wifi, so I installed Debian again to see if it would pick up the wifi automatically.  Nope, so I installed Linux Mint, but didn&rsquo;t like it, so I&rsquo;m back to Debian, but this time trying to get the internal wifi card to work. No luck yet, but I&rsquo;m still confident in my plan get it working.</li>
<li>Today I met new student TEM. It was a trial lesson, so we&rsquo;ll see if she joins.</li>
<li>Recently I&rsquo;ve been entering sentences in to my new anki flashcard type.  Basically sentences using the word in question, and then the word itself. then pronunciations and translations of each.</li>
<li>Recently my right elbow has been hurting.  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s due to too much mousing.  I thought I had my mouse close enough to a neutral position, but apparently not.</li>
<li>We regularly let Jennie outside now.  Lin has come to realize that Jennie will come back after not too long.  Thus far I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s spent the night outside, though she&rsquo;s been outside at night.</li>
<li>S has moved on from the toy store and seems to have gotten a manager position or something at a different branch. Great for her! M now chats with me when I go to the toy store.  Recently we&rsquo;ve been playing with tops, and yesterday we flew a styrofoam airplane.</li>
<li>Tariq and I are working in Unity3D to make our version of pong, which is sorta kinda ready for its version 1 release.</li>
<li>There are a few different design competitions that I&rsquo;ve entered recently.  Who knows what will come of those?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been attending Japanese classes at 80&rsquo;s Cafe in Akihabara 2 or 3 times per week. Along with my Thursday GG class, that puts me in Akiba 3 or 4 times per week! It&rsquo;s allllmost enough to warrant a teiki.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>It&rsquo;s the beginning of the month and I happen to have written to my old i-group:</p>

<p>Yesterday while walking through Ebisu, who should I see, but E; what a surprise!  We had a nice chat and I thought it was high time for a group check-in.</p>

<p>Lin and I are married, living in Kawasaki.  We have no kids, but we have a cat!</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s super busy with work, enjoying her job as a real estate agent.  She&rsquo;s off today, and we just had a heart-to-heart discussion about the challenges of juggling career and relationship.  At the end of the discussion we agreed it&rsquo;s a struggle and worth it to persevere.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working a variety of jobs teaching English and programming websites and apps with the goal of making passive income.</p>

<p>About once per month, I&rsquo;ve been attending ET Contact events&hellip; basically using meditation and consciousness to invite benevolent extra terrestrial intelligent beings to engage in mutually beneficial dialogue.  We haven&rsquo;t really &ldquo;met ET&rdquo; yet, but have heard and seen some interesting anomalous sounds and lights.</p>

<p>In my free time, I must say I&rsquo;ve been mostly attached to my computer, sometimes for too many hours at a time!  Part of that goes to creating mazes for my website <a href="https://www.amazeaweek.net/">https://www.amazeaweek.net/</a>, but a lot of it goes down the proverbial tubes, watching cat videos and porn (not at the same time).</p>

<p>Some of my time wasting is due to not taking care of myself when Lin is working long hours.  I judge I need to learn to take care of myself a bit better.</p>

<p>Sometimes I miss having a partner with whom I can speak easily.  Lin and I use English, but she&rsquo;s self taught, and has a few rough spots.  I feel sadness/anger if I judge I&rsquo;m not being heard, so when she can&rsquo;t understand me, it&rsquo;s a nice opportunity for me to be aware of those feelings.</p>

<p>On the golden side, I&rsquo;ve started studying Japanese to help a bit with communication, though it&rsquo;s a challenging language (as you may know)!</p>

<p>Studying Japanese also helps me feel joy (what&rsquo;s the opposite of shame?); I feel/felt some shame each time I tell people how long I&rsquo;ve been in Japan (12 years) and how terrible my Japanese language still is (but getting better step by step).</p>

<li>Golden week is this week. That means lots of time off.</li>
<li>Lin was involved in an accident a couple weeks ago. She&rsquo;s shrugged it off with flying colors save for the bruise on her leg.</li>
<li>She&rsquo;s been workin&rsquo; lots recently.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve just agreed to work each Tuesday with Sho on projects he&rsquo;s got going on</li>
<li>Might do some work for R at A in E, but not sure yet. Will talk to him tomorrow to see what he has in mind.</li>
<li>Have had one Skype lesson with Chieri, via Mutsumi. They are scheduled for Mondays.</li>
<li>Ted hasn&rsquo;t come back since he got out about a month ago.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t been doing 100 pushups every day, but I&rsquo;ve been considering it!</li>
<li>I have been working on pong; and recently added background music which increases in volume as game play progresses.  It&rsquo;s really neat!</li>
<li>Meeting Mutsumi and her husband + Bruno and his wife to see some art by Magritte today.  I thought she had misspelled Maglite at first (or is it Maglight?)</li>
<li>Weather is nice; I&rsquo;m barefoot today.</li>
<li>Today there&rsquo;s apparently a big fight between two boxers.  I&rsquo;ve heard of one of them.</li>

<p>Oops we&rsquo;re arriving in Yokohama soon so not much time to write.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ted ran away; he has been gone 2 days.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been working on body and soul website with Sho</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been doing AB website for past couple years but not a lot of work now.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been taking Japanese lessons at 80s Cafe in Akihabara, up to 3
times per week (for about 2 weeks now).  Have also been studying
flashcards on Anki, Memrise, and reading TextFugu</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a bit behind on mazes, well not &ldquo;behind&rdquo; exactly but just up to
date.  Need to get some more done quickly to get ahead of schedule
again.</li>
<li>Teaching for JB school a few days per week.  Teaching on Tuesday
mornings and evenings, Wednesday evenings, Thursday mornings and
evenings, and some weekend days.</li>
<li>Have been practicing Unity 2D development, trying to put as much on
github as possible (but recently removed some code from noobtuts&rsquo;
premium offering).</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m somewhat happy with my current direction of my website
setup.. I&rsquo;ve got b.robnugen.com just serving images (b for
&ldquo;binary&rdquo;, a throwback to the old FTP days where we had to tell
which way to transfer the files, as ascii or binary).
www.robnugen.com goes to my old account, but .htaccess quickly
tosses those requests to new.robnugen.com, which is still a bit
wonky as I&rsquo;ve not got my static site generator quite set up.
Middleman is slow as fuck and Hugo can&rsquo;t handle all-utf-8
filenames.
My end goal is to write a static site that contains all the content
from robnugen.com (journal, writings (including the inane stuff
from my wiki (R.O.B.O.T. and other crap I&rsquo;ve forgotten), and
possibly old crap I didn&rsquo;t write), and new stuff: Unity samples,
etc.
All of that should be kept in git via main repo and submodules.</li>
<li>Tariq and I have essentially finished our set of Japanese apps
based on Apple Memory and its little siblings.  One misspelling fix
is waiting for approval now, and we&rsquo;re trying to get the other app
approved, but they&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s confusingly similar to some other
app, which it&rsquo;s not similar to at all.</li>
<li>TJ Bike is outside, but his seat is ripped and soaked with
rainwater a lot of the time.  His chain is rusty, but we don&rsquo;t have
an indoor place to keep him.  I&rsquo;ve just been using Lin&rsquo;s bike, who
has new tires, but no name.</li>
<li>In Unity, so far, I&rsquo;ve just gone through noobtuts tutorials: Pong,
Tetris, and Bejeweled. I am trying to jump into my own project, but
maybe I should keep going through their other toots.</li>
<li>Each time I go down to Fukuura for my lesson, I take the KQ line to
something something station, where I take the Seaside Line, which
is fun because there&rsquo;s no driver and I can sit in front.</li>
<li>Lin is working in real estate again; it&rsquo;s busy and sometimes
stressful, but she&rsquo;s glad to be back in the industry.</li>
<li>Fred and I were talking nearly every day for a while, but haven&rsquo;t
in the past week or so.  I&rsquo;ve not talked to Ma for a while, but my
dad called me on my most recent birthday.</li>
<li>ママ lives in our house downstairs; she&rsquo;s still working early
shifts.  I&rsquo;ve vaguely been able to speak with her more since I
started studying Japanese.</li>
<li>My phone is iPhone 4S which I&rsquo;ve had for a while.  My computer is
aluminum MacBookPro which I&rsquo;ve had for about 3 years now.  It&rsquo;s
about to go out of warranty.  When it can no longer handle the most
up-to-date OS X, I&rsquo;m gonna put Ubuntu on it, and when it&rsquo;s too
tired for even that, I&rsquo;ll get a non-Apple laptop.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been doing 100 pushups per day. I did extra yesterday and only
20 or so today, but I&rsquo;m at 773 for the month, thanks to PUWF (push
ups with friends)</li>
