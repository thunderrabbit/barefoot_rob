<p><center>State of My Life</center>

<ol>

<p><li>I'll be leaving in a few hours for Oklahoma to be an advisor for a week at youth camp!  Wheeee!</li>

<p><li>I'm still hacked about not being able to retrieve my email from flashnet.  Windows 98 screwed up my mailstuff and it looking for a 'postoffice' on my machine.  I created one with the control panel but that didn't do the trick.  I called Flashnet and they said they didn't know.  Argh!!!</li>

<p><li>I am getting new business cards soon.  These will actually be typeset instead of my fun handwritten ones.  I'll make some new handwritten ones soon to reflect my new URL and email and stuff.</li>

<p><li>I have secured www.mrlaboratories.com but the site is not set up yet.
<br>MR Laboratories (pronounced "mister laboratories") is the name that Marcel and I made up during our crazy fun college days. MR stands for Marcel and Rob, or Marty and Rad, the two comic strip characters we developed in our likeness.  The comic strip never got too far, and the company is nothing more than a name, but now we have a URL..  Who knows????

<p>Send us money now and we'll let you know when our stock goes public!</li>

<p><li>After installing Win98, I have just now gotten all my MS Office applications working again.  Linux was never this crazy!!</li>

<p><li>I'm creating a snail mail database of all my homies.  If you wanna be on my snailing list, <a href=mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom>send me</a> your snailing address.</li>

<p><li>Snail Mail..  Think about it.. that's funny!!</li>

<p><li>I'm going to ConCon in a week!! And then I'll see Jen for two days in Palm Springs!  Jen and I have the same b-date and immediately became fast friends when we met several years ago.</li>

<p><li>It's midnight. I still need to do laundry and pack.  I'll probably skip laundry, but I do need to pack.</li>

<h1>State of My Life</h1>

<p><ol></p>

<p><li>Wow!  so so so so so MUCH has happened!</li>

<p><li>I quit my job.  I mentioned that already.</li>

<p><li>I'm busier now that I quit my job than I was before!</li>

<p><li>I got a flat tire on the way to the dentist.  That was an interesting story which just completed today.</li>

<p><li>I went to Rochester, New York for one week for a huge conference called General Assembly! (GA) It was amazing.</li>

<p><li>At GA, I decided to re-start The Feel Good Net</li>

<p><li>At GA, I met Leif Hardison, and soon after GA, we got <a href=https://www.yruu.org>yruu.org</a> set up.</li>

<p><li>After GA, Wende and two friends we met there drove to Niagra Falls.  Parked on the US side and walked to the Canadian side.  Amazing.</li>

<p><li>On our flight home from GA, the pilot swung by Niagra Falls, giving us a spectacular view from only 4000 feet in the air.  Truly awe inspiring.</li>

<p><li>Just today I signed up for health insurance as a self employed type person.</li>

<p><li>Also just today I signed up as a FlashNet distributor. If you want a dialup ISP, gimme a call!</li>

<p><li>I designed new business cards for myself.  They are cool because they're hand written.</li>

<p><li>This morning, I called in to the radio station and won four tickets to IMAX.  But you'd never guess how unless you heard me!</li>

<p><li>Look for all these stories and more coming soon to my journal entries!</li>

<p class=date>24 May 1998</p>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<p><ul>
<p><li>I am for sure going to quit work at my JOB on 19 June.</li></p>

<p><li>I'm super excited about activities planned for the youth group this summer and beyond!
<ul>
<li>First Sunday youth worship</li>
<li>Third Wednesday youth dinner</li>
<li>Last Sunday youth planning meeting</li>
</ul>
and we have scheduled a Social Action Lock-in for 13 June!
</li>

<p><li>I have completed "weaning" myself from my JOB computer. I have my own ISP (FlashNet) and my own modem, zip drive, etc etc. Oh and computer still.</li>

<p><li>Cool thing is that now with my ISP I can have AOL IM chat thing up and ICQ chat thing. Email me if you want my numbers and stuff.</li>

<p><li>I'm a bit behind in journal entries; there are 2 I for sure wanted to get in here, but I don't know if I will. One was that I woke up at 3am to crazy rustling and whining in the tree by my window, and I had no idea what it was and feared the worst: my cat was killing a small whining animal and was about to jump to the window to bring it inside.

<p>Turns out it was just raccoons eating the fruit on the tree! It's a loquat tree and they taste pretty good and are just past ripe (by my judgement) now.

<p>I forgot what the other thing was.</li>

<p><li>I'm excited about GA coming soon to a city near me! (Rochester, New York (okay, not so near, but I'm going!))</li>

<p><li>Today at church only kT, Jon, and Nicole were there.  kT and Nicole babysat; Jon and I chilled and helped them a bit.</li>

<p><li>Today I'm going with my mom to Slidell to see her sister who has cancer. It's an icky all-over-body cancer and I'm sad to see her all messed up.</li>

<p><li>I have an Astroworld Season Pass but I have only gone twice this summer so far!  Auugh!!  I expect I'll go many more times once I quit my job.</li>

<p><li>I am reading <em>Your Money or Your Life</em> by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin. Somewhere in the book it describes that before the industrial revolution, people worked about 3 hours per day. Three.

<p>I think I'll make that my goal.</li>

<p><li>My skating abrasions are healing nicely.</li>

</ul>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Wow-  I haven&rsquo;t written in a while.  Lots of stuff has happened but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get caught up.</li>
<li>I got a new computer:  Pentium II 233 Mhz, two 2.5 gig hard drives, 64 Megs memory, 24X CD Rom, 17&rdquo; monitor with 4 Megs on the card, sound card, etc.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been messing with it a bit each day and will hopefully have a 56k modem working soon, and then I&rsquo;ll get the Feel Good Net going again, which hasn&rsquo;t gone out in 2.5 weeks because THEY at my JOB say &ldquo;thou shalt not surf&rdquo; while at work.<br>
I&rsquo;m surfing now!!! HA HAHAHAahaahaahhaa</li>
<li>Oops there&rsquo;s the boss gotta go.</li></p>

<p><hr>

<p><font size=-1>7 May 1998</font>

<p><li>So I got my computer hooked up last night and I tried to finish this entry but the computer at WORK quit responding so what I typed was lost.</li>
<li>I am now back to working on the New Invoice Service at work. I am adding the capability to write output to a disk file instead of just to the screen or printer. It should be pretty easy.</li>
<li>I am actively working on taking a leave of absence from work. I want time off this summer to do or attend the following:
<ul>
<li>General Assembly (24-30 June)</li>
<li>New Orleans Rally (3-5 July)</li>
<li>laser surgery on my eyes (circa 6 July)</li>
<li>SWUUSI (26-31 July)</li>
<li>ConCon (3-9 August)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the Job won't give me that much time off, I say, "fine- I don't need the money."</li>
</ol></p>

<b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
My brother Fred and I have been working a bit on some genealogical pages here on my website.  They are not yet available for general consumption, but stay tuned.
</li>
<li>
Wende is going to move into another apartment on May 9.  We have been hanging out lately and still are friends and all that. I am certainly glad and pleased for her!
</li>
<li>
I am way likely to quit my job by 3 July 1998.  I have chosen that as the last possible date because it is just before I want to take 2 weeks off for SWUUSI and ConCon.  I will have just taken a week off for GA.
</li>
<li>
Another possible quit date is 19 June 1998.  This date is just before GA.
</li>
<li>
Another possible date is anytime now.  I've been pretty frustrated with having nothing to work on, except one crap project that is compiling as I write this.
</li>
<li>
There are 4 websites in the webring for people named Rob!  I am way excited about that!  And there are 2 sites in the queue (waiting to be part of the ring, but they haven't added the HTML to actually be part of the ring)  Yayyy!!
</li>
<li>
I am working to create a 1/4 time paid position at my church as a youth advisor.  I will soon need to make some money in ways other than working here.
</li>
<li>
I purchased a ZIP drive last night and am in the process of getting a new computer to replace the one that work gives me.  I am planning to get about a Pentium 133 with 32 megs memory and two 1 or 2 gig hard drives.  One drive will be Windoze 95 and one will be for Linux.
</li>
</ol>

<b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
I normally don't do State of My Life Addresses so chronologically
close together, but I am now.
</li>
<li>
At work I've been working much longer hours than normal and I'm still not getting my project done as fast as I want.  I'm working in C++ and I'm stuck on a problem I'm having with some objects written by another group. The objects are designed to create a menu system and allow user input, etcetera. However, for some reason I can't get them to trap CTRL-Z the way I want. It's been pissin' me off for 4 days now.
</li>
<li>
I just found out about dates that Tori Amos is going to play on her tour!  I'm way excited! I'd like to see her in Los Angeles, because then I can see Jen, who is my Tori Amos fan soulmate! Jen's birthday is the same as mine (25 March).
</li>
<li>
I'm listening to <b>nine inch nails</b> <em>closer to god</em> CD.
</li>
<li>
This weekend I'm going to Austin to play Ultimate!
</li>

Some years ago I heard the President's <em>State of the Union</em> address and I thought it would be cool if I wrote <em>State of My Life</em> addresses in my diary.  
<p>
They go something like this:

<b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
I am flat tired of living with Wende but I'm too fucking scared to tell her because I don't want to break her heart.<br>
(This is probably the 1 thing I needed to get off my chest; how ironic that I can tell the whole world but not Wende. I'm not really telling the world, though; almost no one visits my page anymore.  Well, except for you, and I appreciate it.)
</li>
<li>
I have been King of my I-Group for the past 4 weeks.  This coming Monday we will be meeting at Dave and Buster's instead of at our normal place.
</li>
<li>
I learned that Manda, one of my ex-girlfriends, and actually the one ex-girlfriend I think about most, was in a major accident, but walked away physically unscathed.  I haven't actually talked to her about it, but heard about it from her mom.
</li>
<li>
The disk drive on my computer goes into sleep mode every minute or so, even if I'm working on it and typing and stuff. If I'm in a bad mood, it further pisses me off to have to wait for it to cycle back on.  See? it just did it again.
</li>
<li>
I have just gotten back into gymnastics class; I think I wrote that in a previous entry.  The first night I started, I was able to do round-off back flips.  Big tall ones.<br>
The next week, I was able to do round-off back flips and punch fronts (front flips).<br>
The next week, I worked on the runway trampoline on back handsprings and was able to do them pretty well, and I even did some back handspring back flips.  Cool.<br>
Currently the gym is closed for 2 weeks so they can move to a bigger facility next door.
</li>
<li>
My stretch in I-group was to spend some money on myself. That week, I purchased an Astroworld Season Pass, and I am way excited about it.<br>
The coolest thing is they just built a new coaster that has 4 loops!!!  I am so excited that I might go on opening day, which is tomorrow!
</li>
<li>
I need to get some new glasses.
</li>
<li>
I would like to spend more time on myself... more time writing on my webpage, more time meditating.. but for some reason I just haven't been doing that.  I cite Wende living with me as the reason I don't, but I'm not sure that's a good reason.  I don't know what the deal is.
</li>
<li>
At work, I just finished the latest version of invoice_lookup_server, and I am really proud of it. The main addition I made allows it to read information from an RDB (Relational Database) using SQL (Structured Query Language).  I have designed it so any query can be made on any database, and the format of the output is pretty darn flexible. New queries may be added, and existing queries may be changed without a coding change.  All of the queries and formatting are defined in text files and can be changed no problem.
</li>
<li>
At work, I am supposed to begin working with Allen on a project, but I'm not looking forward to it because Allen is a dork and the project requires changing some old old old crappy crappy crappy code.  It's a monster program written in PL/1 and I'm not happy about working on it.
</li>
<li>
It's 2:34am.<br>
I wrote the above 10 entries and just now spent almost 1 hour separating my 1997 and 1998 journal entries into two directories. I feel good to have gotten that cleaned up.<br>
My next goal will be to rename the 1997 entries.  Realistically, I may never do that.
</li>

<h1>State of my life address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Though my sign on my wall says &quot;Stop Looking (for a girlfriend)&quot; I still kinda am
but not entirely.</p>

<p>Cathy has said no because I won't have sex.  Diana is too religiously inclined for me.  She said
she's thought about becoming a nun so she could simply serve God.</p></li>

<li><p>My camera has been stolen.  In it were pictures of Thanksgiving activities and shit.  That
really upsets me - I can't trust the UH campus as much as I'd like to.</p></li>

<li><p>I learned a new fresh frisbee move from Danny, the light dude from the band Catherine
Wheel.</p></li>

<li><p>I have read <em>Journeys Out of the Body</em> by Robert A. Monroe.  It will take much
practice, but (I see my hands therefore I am dreaming) the first step he says is to let your body
fall asleep while your brain stays awake.  So far I have only <del>succed</del> succeeded in
falling asleep with my body.  However, my dreams are either bigger or somehow more vivid or more
memorable or just all around more.  I'm not sure what it is exactly.  I don't remember my dreams
any more than normal but I have a feeling that my conscious brain knows I'm dreaming but just
doesn't remember it.  I will keep trying.</p></li>

<li><p>My house is a fucking mess but I'll get it better.  I've built or otherwise installed small
shelves.</p></li>

<li><p>I've gone CD crazy.  I'm signed up with BMG music services &amp; I signed up Heather and I
want lots of CDs.</p></li>

<li><p>The days are getting shorter.  I look forward to the approach of Fred's birthday.</p></li>

<li><p>2 More weeks of school.</p></li>

<li><p>I have really hated Database this semester.  I hope to pass.</p></li>

<li><p>Eva the babe TA with braces kissed some guy in the hall.  Fuck.</p></li>

<li><p>I'm not looking for a girlfriend - just someone to kiss.  This changes daily.</p></li>
