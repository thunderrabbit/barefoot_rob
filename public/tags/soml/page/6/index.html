                        <p class=date>17:39 Tuesday 14 September 1999</p>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>I love my new job!  I&rsquo;m network administrator for a small company called FSD Data Services.  We have about 15 computers networked, about ten Windows NT 4.0, two Windows 95, and one unix (Free BSD).  Unix box is the email server, one of the windows NT is our web server.  I&rsquo;m slowly crawling up the learning curve hill and loving getting paid to learn this stuff!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m working about 30 hours per week, have Tuesdays off to do KTRU (9-11am CST (listen on <a href="https://www.ktru.org/realaudio.html">realaudio!</a>)) and whatever else I want to do.  Making $17 per hour which is less than at Telecheck, but I get to wear shorts and T-shirt and run around the office barefoot!</li></p>

<p><p><li>All that happy money is going toward paying of my $9000 debt which I accumulated on credit cards during my 13 months of not working.  Once I&rsquo;m out of debt this time (I got out of $26000 debt after college) I&rsquo;ll more carefully invest some dollars and continue to work for as long as I am happy doing that.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I keep on thinking &ldquo;Road Trip!&rdquo; in my brain.. driving into west Texas somewheres and just playing.  I keep on squawking about this but never do it, and there&rsquo;s tons of references to &ldquo;digital camera&rdquo; in my entries..  The desire is still here; I&rsquo;m not sure why I don&rsquo;t just do it.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I recently finished my scrapbook (not online) of Costa Rica!  Nice feeling to <em><b>finally</b></em> get those damn pictures off my kitchen table and archived nicely in a book on one of my shelves.</p>

<p><p>I have also archived pictures from my two week adventure in Iowa.  Did that just today.  It didn&rsquo;t take as long because I didn&rsquo;t write notes throughout the book naming people or describing the events. We&rsquo;ll see if I ever do that.</p>

<p><p>The goal of all this picture archiving is to clear off my kitchen table. It&rsquo;s a beautiful round wooden table, given to me by Christine&rsquo;s parents some years ago.  I think the table (and I) will be happier with less crap on it.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Over the weekend, Spot, my cat, developed a big lump on his left jaw.  When Fred came in at 8am Saturday, he noticed it.  The lump was bigger on Sunday, and Spot was obviously experiencing pain trying to eat, so we took him to an ER vet clinic.  The girl at the desk said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an abcess.&rdquo;  The doctor, after poking and proding and listening to Spot&rsquo;s heart and lungs said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s probably an abcess.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(watch out, it gets gross)
<br>I paid $190.  They knocked Spot out, shaved his left beard, lanced the lump and apparently squirted out 3 ounces of puss-y (pun intended) cottage cheese looking puss.   Mmmmm.. cottage cheese&hellip;</p>

<p><p>By 2pm, Fred had left (after we went to see Ma preach at <a href="https://www.firstuu.org">First UU Church</a> on Fannin (Ma = our mom)) and I went to get Spot, who was only bleeding a bit, and certainly seemed happier.  Soon as I got home, he hopped out of the open car window and I had to grab him before he hopped the fence.  He&rsquo;s an indoor cat for a week or so until he heals.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I have stopped being super active selling FlashNet accounts. That&rsquo;s kind of a misstatement; I was never super active in the first place. But the reason I quit even thinking about being super active is that I just harshed myself for not being active, not making tons of cash, not doing the steps required to make some dollars with FlashNet.  I feel a million times happier now that I have released myself from the need to be successful in that arena.  It feels great!</li></p>

<p><p><li>Today during my day off, I did KTRU (did not violate any FCC rules this week!), went grocery shopping (bought the wrong type of razors), worked on my photo archiving (put New Orleans Rally, Youth Council, and Con Con pics in a book), reviewed a CD for KTRU (number 37 since I&rsquo;ve started as a DJ there in January(?)), and read a bit of a Newsweek magazine that came to my mailbox unexpectedly.  Oh look- it&rsquo;s for the wrong address.  I really just now looked and saw that.</p>

<p><p>But actually, that (it came to my address in error) is interesting.  Magazine arrived, I read the articles on the internet, found a URL for a webcam site <a href="https://www.jennicam.org">jennicam.org</a>.  I visited the site, and found she has some sparse journal entries and was inspired to write this entry.  And now you&rsquo;re reading it!  All because the postal service misdelivered a magazine to my mailbox.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Now I&rsquo;m going to drop off the CD at KTRU and attend a monthly reunion of the Project Heart graduates.  Fun stuff!  I&rsquo;ll write more when I get back.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Wow.  <a href="https://www.jeffdurstconsulting.com/heart">Project Heart</a> (I&rsquo;m not sure if this is the correct URL; the site is not responding) is always great for me!  I&rsquo;m reinspired to continue work on my roller coaster book; I&rsquo;m going to call Astroworld business office and begin a process of interviewing long time employees to uncover the history of Astroworld, especially its coasters!  As &ldquo;just a customer&rdquo; I know a lot about the rides and the park, more than some employees.  I&rsquo;d like to learn more!</li></p>

<p><p><li>That reminds me; I haven&rsquo;t seen Dawn in since whenever that was that Dude and I lunched with her.  But I called her last night just to say HI (HI Dawn!).  We will probably go munch lunch or something sometime soon. Depends on when her next job starts.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I haven&rsquo;t shaved in several days, nor done laundry.  These will happen soon.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I just finished a website for a friend of mine who sells baby blankets from her home.  Check out <a href="https://www.blanketstoyou.com">Blankets To You</a>!</li></p>

<p><p><li>It&rsquo;s now 7:34am Wednesday 15 September 1999, only 108 days until 2000!!!  Do you have plans?  I pretty much don&rsquo;t.  I feel like I&rsquo;ll go skating downtown and/or in Montrose and watch people.</li>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>
<br>&ldquo;Feast or Famine&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>This entry is ramblesome; read it only if you&rsquo;re entirely interested.</p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>I&rsquo;ve heard many times that insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  Some parts of my life are insane in this manner; others are not.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I was working for a little at a company that shall remain nameless (have I already told this story?)  I think I have.  Anyway, they were inventorying their stuff for Y2K compliance, I hated the work, so I quit after only 3 days.</li></p>

<p><p><li>quit?  Yeah - I quit in order to stop the insanity.</li></p>

<p><p><li>So what do I plan to do for dollars for Australia?  Hmm.  Well, I&rsquo;ve got a lot of pictures of roller coasters that I think are pretty good.  I&rsquo;m going to enter some into a local art show around the end of the month; we&rsquo;ll see how that goes.</li></p>

<p><p>This is Step 1 of doing something different in my life.</p>

<p><p><li>Step 0 was working at KTRU; that has totally brought some fun new experiences and friends into my life!</li></p>

<p><p><li>Step 2 is actually like step 1.5: work more on website design.  I&rsquo;ve got 3 accounts kinda on hold.  One while I figure out how to get the Perl cgi shopping cart to work, the other 2 while the customers get their ISPs set up for shopping cart use.</p>

<p><p>Actually I can help them make that process go faster.</li></p>

<p><p><li>And lastly; somewhere in all these past 2 weeks I am certain I&rsquo;d have more journal entries on my website if I had a laptop computer handy.  I could just type type type while on the plane, or in the car or chillin&rsquo; in the hotel or by the pool&hellip;.  I am not totally sickly attached to my computer, but I just really enjoy having my journal entries online.</p>

<p><p>I can&rsquo;t explain it.</li></p>

<p><p><li>So I&rsquo;m in the market for a Dell P133 laptop.  I choose Dell because I&rsquo;ve heard they can run linux quite nicely.  Compaq apparently does not.</li>

                        <p class=date>1:01pm Tuesday 22 June 1999</p>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>Right at this moment I am missing KTRU.  I&rsquo;m scheduled to be there, but I&rsquo;m at work.  Super duper special thanks to Aline for covering for me.  Unfortunately, I won&rsquo;t be able to KTRU (KTRU is a verb) next week either; I&rsquo;ll be in Salt Lake City!</li></p>

<p><p><li>I got a job. I&rsquo;m making $13/hour doing Y2K compliance type stuff.  That amount looks pitiful, but I was making nothing otherwise, or not much.  Dude and I got a nice phat $900 each for a website we worked on (<a href="https://www.frontofficeautomation.com">www.frontofficeautomation.com</a>) but I&rsquo;m not super impressed with the site.  Our guy won&rsquo;t give us content to put on the site!</li></p>

<p><p><li>So anyway the job I&rsquo;m at (Dude is here too) is nearly pointless.  This company (call it KZ) is still doing inventory of their stuff, which was originally scheduled to be completed 31 Dec 1998.  The technique is pretty wack as well.  KZ has offices all over the world, and has asked all their offices to send an excel spreadsheet of all their stuff that might be affected.   Here at KZ headquarters, they receive an excel spreadsheet, cut and paste columns of fields into a different-formatted excel spreadsheet, then import the spreadsheets into MS Access running a program called Tracker.</p>

<p><p>Tracker is designed to monitor the progress of all the stuff and keep track of what is compliant, what&rsquo;s not; who&rsquo;s in charge of each part, the risk, the cost associated.. all that.  That makes enough sense for reporting, but it&rsquo;s written crappily, (or maybe on a slow server, but I don&rsquo;t think so; I got here at 8:00am and was the only one access the database and it was still slow) so it&rsquo;s slow as crap.</p>

<p><p>So the excel spreadsheets are imported and then a big report is printed and then the report sent back to the office that sent the data in the first place.  That office marks up the report and says, &ldquo;actually this item goes in this category, and these go here, blah blah&rdquo; and then we modify our database to reflect their changes.</p>

<p><p>That&rsquo;s where KZ company is now.  Still receiving excel spreadsheets, and I just made changes to about 100 records in the past 1.5 days.  Only 100 records, and I was given 3 days to do it.  The system is so slow and crappily written that it really takes that type of timeframe.  BLAH!!</p>

<p><p>Thanks for listening.</li></p>

<p><p><li>On Sunday, Wende and I went to my dad&rsquo;s and I gave him a hand painted glazed pottery bowl labeled &ldquo;DAD&rsquo;S BIG ICE CREAM BOWL!&rdquo;  I love it.  We ate ice cream and then chinese buffet and just hung out all day.</p>

<p><p>Dad&rsquo;s, um, friend Karin was there and she looked at my roller coaster pics.  She loved them!  She greatly encouraged me to have some enlarged and matted and framed and sell them!!!!  Holy cow!  I agree the pictures are nice, and yes, actually, I could see some of them as posters or prints, but wow..  it&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine actually being able to make money selling pics of roller coasters!  I am certainly open to the idea.  Any suggestions on <a href="mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom">how to market</a> them??</li></p>

<p><p><li>Last night I skated 11 miles in an hour.  Down my street to Montrose, to W Dallas, to Taft, did not wreck crossing the intersection at Allen Parkway, to downtown, down the Louisiana street hill, to Main street, down the Main Street hill, all the way down Main to Richmond, to Montrose, then back to West Gray and home. Nice.  I really needed that exertion.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I was inspired to skate after being at my dad&rsquo;s and he told his version of my <a href="../../skate/skate06.html">skating accident</a> story. He said that while I was in ICU, my pulse was at 55 beats per minute, and my breathing between 8 and 12 breaths per minute. The doctors were all, &ldquo;yeah - we don&rsquo;t see this too often; only in marathon runners and stuff.&rdquo;   &ldquo;How about skating 60 miles per week?&rdquo; my dad offered.  &ldquo;Yeah, that would do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wow. I really love being healthy.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Jen is in town again!  She&rsquo;s going to move to Houston in like August or something, and now she&rsquo;s here to look for a homestead and network for jobs and stuff.  Also, we are going to Salt Lake City for a week starting Thursday!  This is for a large <a href="https://www.uua.org">UU</a> conference called General Assembly, actually at which Wende and I met Jen last year in Rochester New York. (I think I never finished those entries did I?)  Anyway, we&rsquo;re going to SLC, and will make a side trip to visit Lagoon Beach (or something) where they have a few roller coasters and fun stuff!!</li></p>

<p><p><li>Wow big storm cloud moving in.</li></p>

<p><p><li>So anyway, about this roller coaster pictures and stuff:  If I can make dollars selling images of coasters, that would be so entirely infinitely fabulous!!!!  Truly making dollars doing what I love to do; ride coasters and taking pictures.</p>

<p><p>Wende is currently intentionally unemployed, Jen is here currently unemployed, and ironically Dude and I are employed, but we&rsquo;re not sure what we wanna do for real.  Dude should be climbing mountains for a living, and actually I think he&rsquo;s on track for that.  I&rsquo;m getting on track to sell some coaster pics. Maybe <em>this</em> will inspire me to get some scanned and online!</li></p>

<p><p>Oh, so I was saying Wende and Jen are unemployed; maybe I can use them as cheerleaders to get my pics enlarged matted and framed.  This will be great fun!

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>Jason and I are going to Australia in November.  That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re working to save some dollars now.  We&rsquo;ll also take scuba lessons so we can dive while there.</li></p>

<p><p><li>This morning I was pondering the phases of my life since high school in terms of Big Focii Of My Life.
<br>Graduated high school in 1988.
<br>Spent 2 years at North Harris County College.
<br>Spent 5 years at University of Houston (3.5 years barefoot with frisbee)
<br>Spent 2.5 years working at Telecheck
<br>Spent 1 year not working at Telcheck, part way working on my businesses (website design with <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">MR Labs</a>, internet sales with <a href="https://www.flash.net/~robnugen">Flash Net</a>)</li></p>

<p><p>This most recent phase is where I am now, and I&rsquo;m beginning to add something to it.. on the surface, it appears that I&rsquo;m traveling a lot and riding roller coasters all over the US (well, I&rsquo;ve just gotten started but that&rsquo;s the idea).  I&rsquo;m creating a book during/of this process.  The book is a prototype for my big coffee table book which I&rsquo;ll create when a have funding from some wealthy entity.</p>

<p><p>Under the surface of all this travel and roller coasters and fun is an intangible something..  a belief that life doesn&rsquo;t have to be hard.. a set of beliefs:
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t have to work a 9-5 job
<li>I don&rsquo;t have to work at all to be a good person
<li>I can do what I love and the money will follow
<li>I trust that the universe will provide me with any resources I need
<li>I can teach other people the same thing
</ul></p>

<p><p>This last one is a big part of my coaster book - that I can teach by example that anyone can do whatever they want to do.  Just believe and trust and go do it.</p>

<p><p>We are souls having a human experience.  The soul knows we cannot die, but the human ego does not.  Con<em>sole</em> your ego, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re scared, but trust me this will be fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><li>Part of me thinks that people will read the above and be all, &ldquo;what a load of crap!!&rdquo; but I trust that someone will read it and connect.  For that person who wants to learn more, email Janice or Jeff about <a href="https://www.jeffdurstconsulting.com/heart.htm">Project Heart</a>.  This is the course that has really helped me believe I can do it.  Also read Conversations with God by Neale Walsch, also read Your Heart&rsquo;s Desire by Sonia Choquette.</p>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>I recently came to the realization that my life feels too busy/complicated lately. With help from Wende, I pondered this in my diary and found that back in my college days, I was busy, but not quite as busy as now. Also, back then some of my busi-ness included good exercise (Ultimate and disc golf), good friends (hanging at the dorms) and good food (dorm food is more balanced than my current eating habits)
<br>Hmmmm.
<br>Wende also pointed out that my life had 1 big focus: COLLEGE. Now I have a couple of big foci: Business/financial, Youth group work, men&rsquo;s group, my websites/email
<br>Hmmmm.</li></p>

<p><p><li>For New Year&rsquo;s I went to Northwoods Unitarian Church (the one I grew up in) for a youth lock-in. We played Sardines, Silent Football, watched movies, and made a life sized pinata of Jason Fricke!</li></p>

<p><p><li>This weekend I&rsquo;m going to Atlanta for a FlashNet conference! I&rsquo;m super excited about it; and expect to return with a plethora of ideas and energy to build my business (and my busi-ness!)</li></p>

<p><p><li>Yesterday I made some <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> page flyers advertising my FlashNet business and handed out small stacks to four different apartment complexes. They were all quite happy to put them in with their Move-In packets for all new residents! Yay!!</li></p>

<p><p><li>Manda and I recently went to see Rush Hour at the theater on family night when every seat is 50 cents! We spent an equal amount on a pinball game before the movie, and she totally kicked my ass at it! She did so well that she kept getting bonuses and extra turns and everything and it actually made us a tad late to the movie! Watching her do so well was worth the wait. Today I bought her an orange &ldquo;Push Up&rdquo; ice cream thing and a Kit Kat for myself.</li></p>

<p><p><li>It&rsquo;s after midnight and I still haven&rsquo;t packed for this weekend!!! Shannon is picking me up at 6:30am (actually her boyfriend is driving us).</li></p>

<p><p><li>It&rsquo;s one week and 20 hours until the Houston Rally and we still need 30+ registrations in order to break even. I know we&rsquo;ll do it; the forms will begin to flood in up until the last minute!</li></p>

<p><p><li>I took Spot (my cat) to the vet for his yearly check-up, and he still weighs 8 pounds just like last year!</li></p>

<p><p><li>In February I&rsquo;m going to see Jen in New Hampshire!  See, she is coming down to Houston in August to visit Rice University and I was all, &ldquo;do you realize how hot it will be in August?&rdquo;  and the conversation grew to the point where we decided to exchange cities during the most extreme temperatures of the year.  Makes sense to me!!  (BTW, today I think it got up to 79 degrees in Houston)</li>

<p class=date>6 November 1998</p>

<h1>STATE OF MY LIFE</h1>

<p><ol>

<p><li>After some meditation, I have determined something. My want is not "to be successful in my own business."  I already knew I don't want a full time job.  
<br>My want is to make some dollars and then have time to travel and play.</li>

<p>So I decided to become a gigilo.  Wait! no. no. just kiddin'.

<p>So I'm looking for some kind of part time consulting work - programming or HTML or whatever, and to that end I have called a couple of people and have put my want out to the universe, and now on my website.

<p>(For those keeping close tabs, I still signed the contract for the register receipt tape advertising on the Kroger stores.  One will begin on 29 December, the other like 21 January 1999.  They will each run for 12 weeks, I think.  I'll scan those and let you know how that all turns out.)

<p><li>My trip to Costa Rica is coming soon to an airport near me!!  I'm super excited about it, and will likely go purchase a camera (instead of borrowing Wende's all the time).  Hey, is Costa Rica flooded and destroyed now as I understand Honduras is? Hmmmm. That might be important to find out.</li>

<p><li>It's gettin' cold here in Houston! Cold by Houston standards -- it's around 60 degrees daily and down in the 50s at night. My cat Spot sleeps with me at night now. Today he climbed into a grocery sack and we play fought through the bag.</li>

<p><li>My ankle is getting better after I messed it up a couple weeks ago jumping over Maggie's couch.</li>

<p><li>I have almost completed my marble-track ball-clock. 
<p>"What the heck is that?" you may ask.

<p>Okay. Um, imagine, if you will, a chrome marble a bit less than one cm in diameter.  Okay, now imagine that marble on two popsicle sticks like on a train track. Tilt the sticks slightly, and it will roll down.

<p>Okay. <em>Now</em> imagine a long track of popsicle sticks with twists and turns and guard rails and a bunch of chrome marbles to roll down it.  That's the "marble-track" part of the project.

<p>Now imagine a novelty clock from like Sharper Image, that has an arm that picks up a marble at the bottom of the clock and drops that marble at the top of the clock exactly once per minute.  The clock has pathways and little levers to line up the marbles and roll them around and it keeps track of time that way. The Sharper Image version of this clock is all black plastic.

<p>My dad got such a clock a long-ass time ago for Christmas - like in the early 80s. Some time later he gave it to my brother who enjoyed it for a while, who gave it back to my dad, and he kept it for a while and then he gave it to me.

<p>I kept the little plastic levers, but I ripped out all the plain boring straight plastic track and have replaced it all with popsicle sticks, toothpicks, and two tongue depressors to hold the whole thing up.  This project started in late September, and I was 2/3rds done by mid October.  Just yesterday I began work again, and will soon complete the whole thing.  (I know the dates because I've written the date on practically each stick as I glued it on.)

<p>If I can, I'll get pictures of it and put them on the site. (It's really small, like 5x5x4 inches, so I'll have to get a close-up focusin' camera.)</li>

<p><li>I've been listening to KTRU, 91.7 Rice Radio, and it's really cool because they play all these obscure unpopular songs, so they have a small listening audience.  Therefore, whenever they give away like movie passes or whatever, I can always win! I got passes to ORGAZMO recently, and just yesterday I won passes to Happiness.  I'll go pick them up today.</li>

<p><li>SCOTT, a band featuring Kris Scott on vocals, guitar, bass, drums and keyboard, just put out a new album. It's got covers of a bunch of different bands: They Might Be Giants, Sonic Youth, Pavement, Radiohead, The Pixies, and others, plus original tunes that express a variety of moods and stuff.  Anyway, that's my plug, and if you want a copy, it's only 5 bucks and supports my friend Kris who is just getting started in the music biz. Email him <a href="mailto:bitter-boy@juno.com">here.</a>

<p><li>Oh, so I forgot to mention the reason I mentioned that is when I go to KTRU to pick up my passes, I'll drop off the latest SCOTT album and get SCOTT on the airwaves!</li>

<p><li>I wrote a resume yesterday.</li>

<p><hr align="center" width="25%">

<p><li>1:29pm same day
<br>I just picked up the passes from KTRU and while at the station
I was all, "do you have to be a student to work here?"   

<p>"No, but preference is given to students.  You might try during Christmas 
break."

<p>!!!! So I'm going to apply to be a DJ at KTRU over the holidays!  Truue!</li>

</ol>

<p>See ya!

<p class=date>30 October 1998</p>

<h1>STATE OF MY LIFE</h1>

<p><ol>

<p><li>Today begins San Antonio Rally.  From previous experience, I know if I don't write before the rally about stuff that happened before the rally, it probably won't be written</li>

<p><li>This past week, Manda and I saw the movie ORGAZMO, the new Trey Parker film.  There were 5 people in the theater, including us, and we had free passes to get in. It was pretty funny in that Southpark kinda way, but I'm pretty glad I didn't pay for it.</li>

<p><li>That night she spent the night and we spent just about the whole next day in bed.  Okay, maybe the movie did have some merit.</li>

<p><li>D'oh! but I missed an appointment for a general physical exam that I decided to do just to do it before I go to Costa Rica.</li>

<p><li>In the early part of the week, I was feeling pretty crappy in general, unproductive, that kind of thing. Scott (my car) went to the doctor on Tuesday and was feeling better $240 later.</li>

<p><li>I signed the paperwork to get MR Labs advertised on the back of the receipt tape at two Krogers near my house!
A friend of mine pointed out that advertising there would not be his suggestion; he wouldn't look for professional website design on the back of register tape, and I almost didn't do it, but when I thought about it later, it just felt like the right decision.  We'll see what happens.
They don't go out until January 1999.</li>

<p><li>Last night Wende and Eric and I went to see ORGAZMO. We had two free passes, and figured we could pay for 1 between us, but ironically, Eric and I left the pass at my apartment and he just paid for all of us.</li>

<p><li>I've been chatting in the Sauna on <a href="https://www.wbs.net" target="wbs">www.wbs.net</a>, an online chat thing.  My character is Thunder Rabbit, who likes to jump on the trampoline in there and play Chickenball.</li>

<p><li>Matt and Nathan are here chillin' until the rally.  They just came in from New Orleans by bus.</li>

<p><li>Oh! In the latter part of this week, I felt much happier and more productive when I figured out how to do stuff with cookies and forms and JavaScript!  I was able to make a couple of pages that set cookies and remember a user's name and what color they chose.  If you want to see them, <a href="mailto:thunderrabbitATcheerfulDOTcom">ask me</a>, and I'll give you the URL.  (2003 July: they're long gone; don't ask)</li>

<p><li>I spent some time updating the /images directory of the Southwest District YRUU website.  Nothing amazing; I didn't add any content, but just organized the pictures into directories and stuff.</li>

<p><li>Part of me thinks, "wow; what a boring week" but I'm still having fun.</li>

<b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b>
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>I have mostly recovered from losing my hard drive, and I am more careful to archive the documents I update regularly. However(!) my disply adapter is only running at 640x480 pixels and 16 colors!  I've tried everything I can think of and I can't get it to do more. Kinda hard to scan pics this way!</li>

<p><li>I had fun at gymnastics tonight - did roundoff back flips and got some that were pretty high compared to normal for me.  I bounced lots on the trampoline too.
<br>Oh and it was weird since I wore my glasses there; I can't tumble with them on, so I was essentially tumbling blind, or at least very blurry.  Kinda fun!</li>

<p><li>I quit my part time job today.  Now It's just me and MR Laboratories, my web design company!  I'm nervous and excited all at once! I opened my business bank account and have tons of tax forms and all kinds of craziness. Come on by <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.mrlaboratories.com</a> to see my site there!</li>

<p><li>My dad gave me a clock that we've dubbed "the ball clock."  It has an arm that picks up a marble from the bottom and drops it into the top of the clock once per minute.  With a few simple weighted levers, the balls line up and keep track of time.

<p>This clock has been in our family for years..  Probably like 15 or 20 years.  It's been dormant at my dad's house for as many as 10 years; it's been with my brother for some years, and my brother gave it back to my dad, and my dad gave it to me.

<p>Yay!! I enjoyed watching the clock do its thing for a few weeks.

<p>Yesterday I ripped out the assembly of troughs that guide the marbles to their appropriate levers, which I left intact. My goal is to rebuild the troughs with popsicle sticks!

<p>Really.  Don't laugh!  I can do this, and maybe I'll get pics of it on here (I've been promising a lot of pics on my site lately, haven't I?)</li>

<p><li>Over the weekend I had a Beastie Boys marathon, listening to all their albums over and over, especially _Hello Nasty_, which I really enjoy.</li>

<p><li>Spot, my cat of two years, has been more talkative lately.  He still jumps out the second story window to a branch to go outside, and comes back the same way. I just thought I'd mention him.</li>

<p><li>Starting the second weekend of October, I'll be busy for 6 weekends in a row. Wow..  That includes driving to San Antonio, Lake Texoma (on the border of Texas and Oklahoma, hence the name), and a drive to and from Tulsa.  Crazy!</li>

<li>It's currently 3:06am.  Why am I up so late?</li>
<li>I just uploaded two pages to my new domain <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.MRLaboratories.com</a>! This site is for my webpage design business!</li>
<li>Spot, my cat, is curled up so very cutely in a small box beside me.. If I just had a camera!</li>
<li>Speakin' of cameras, I got a lotta pictures from when Houston flooded this past weekend!  I still intend to get some scanned and onto my site.</li>
<li>Oh yeah-- I have just recovered web access and stuff after my machine was down all last week.  I lost a 2.5 gig hard drive and <em>all</em> my email before like 9 September or so. Sigh.</li>
<li>Yipes! I haven't sent out a Feel Good Net in a while!</li>
<li>I'm going to Costa Rica in November!  I think I'm leaving on 18 November (Tammy's birthday) and coming back on 26 November. I'll be meeting my friend Kathryn (from California) there. I am totally excited about this trip!</li>

<h1>STATE OF MY LIFE</h1>

<p><ol>
<p><li>I am pissed right now at Windows 98 because my web browsers keep locking up and stuff.</li></p>

<p><li>I've been feeling overall crappy in my life; I feel unproductive even though I'm doing stuff all the time. I'm doing youth work, organizing projects, encouraging participation, pulling staples, attending conferences and dinners...</li>

<p><li>but my apartment is a wreck and sometimes I think "I shouldn't have broken up with Wende" cause she obviously did a lot more work on the apartment than I ever recognized. Or maybe it's just been because I've been out of town for essentially 3 weeks of the past month.</li>

<p><li>I haven't gotten my ConCon journal entries transcribed yet. They are all written in my diary, but not here on my webpage.</li>

<p><li>I got 10 rolls of film developed from the week of ConCon. Fabulous pictures in several cases and I may scan them and get them on here.</li>

<p><li>I'm getting a few hits per day; I thank you all for visiting and/or returning as the case may be!</li>

<p><li>I have to zip off to the Lodge now for work.</li>

<p><font size =-1>3:30pm</font>

<p><li>after work I'm feelin' better, and have scheduled a chat with my friend Char (pronounced "shar"), who I see infrequently.  Each time we talk, she offers fabulous insightful thoughts that have always helped me become clear about my life.</li>
