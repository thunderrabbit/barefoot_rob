<p>Recently,</p>

<ul>
<li>An elderly man fell as he was getting off the bus with an elderly
woman. Everyone on the bus exclaimed, but the bus driver took off
before anyone moved.</li>
<li>I nearly completed the M Splitter on Marble Track 3.</li>
<li>I tried getting Netlify CMS working, but still have a few bits
missing, starting with authentication.</li>
<li>I failed an test at TY.  There will be other chances, but I felt sad
because I had thought I would do better.</li>
<li>Eight men attended men&rsquo;s circle last Tuesday.  We may have even more
this coming Tuesday.</li>
<li>I finished <em>The Saint&rsquo;s Rise</em>; Michael said my edits/comments were great help!</li>
<li>Sleeping Bag, the first classical music event where attendees were
invited to sleep during the performance, was a great success,
despite having had limited time for advertising.</li>
<li>I got an old copy of the new SB DB from Alfonzo.</li>
<li>Jennie can now enter/exit PRN through her door.</li>

<h2 id="05-37-monday-04-september-2017-jst">05:37 Monday 04 September 2017 JST</h2>

<ol>
<li>As of last night, Lin and I plan to go to Peru, likely to The Way Inn, in 2018.</li>
<li>I am up early to head to work (teach) at IL.</li>
<li>I will soon have another lesson starting on Mondays, kinda within walking distance (1.5 hour walk)</li>
<li>I have to leave for work in 5 minutes, and am debating taking my computer to work on SoML. Okay I will take it because I think writing in my journal is an important artifact of my life.</li>
<li>The left hand ctrl key doesn&rsquo;t work on this USB keyboard. I am not sure why I haven&rsquo;t mapped it to caps lock, but I may do that.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve got semicolon mapped to backspace and apostrophe mapped to return.  This is so my right pinky doesn&rsquo;t have to move as far.  Awesomely enough, my middle finger was just now able to hit F8, which I have mapped to apostrophe. (and F9 to quote.  Let&rsquo;s see if I can hit it without looking {&ldquo;.  Pretty close.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s now 6:20am and I&rsquo;ve just sat down on the Romance Car, which will arrive in Shinjuku at 6:41am.</li>
<li>I had an idea for a new app game thing.  MVP: People place messages
with geo-coordinates.  The messages can only be read by people who
are sufficiently close to those coordinates.  Next, messages can be
password encrypted.  Next, messages can have a readable radius
attached to them.</li>
<li>I wonder when/if I/who will write the app.  I can start with a sample geo-tag photos app and then go from there.</li>
<li>I have not been working on AB as much as before.  I wonder if they are done with the project.</li>
<li>Noborito station now has rails again. This time they were welded together before being placed.</li>
<li>I am considering starting a new men&rsquo;s circle (on Saturdays?) to which I will invite the men from SOGO.  Gotta find a location first and see if most of them are good with Saturdays.  Actually, I should see if they are good for Saturdays first, and then see if any of them know a location.</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 now has about 2 minutes of video worth of exposures (at 12 frames per second).  At this point in the movie, the characters are approaching the spinning (flying) bearing with hooked poles so they can center it above the stage.  After that, the screws will be placed and the screwdriver will drive them into the stage.  After that, the helicopter will be turned to 11 so it can fly the stage itself.</li>
<li>I found a restaurant in Tokyo Tower where I can use an electric outlet.  When my Monday afternoon lessons start, I will probably chill there for a couple hours (and work) while waiting for the lesson.</li>
<li>Lin and I have Jennie (the cat named after Jennifer) who is now about 4 years old I think.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t reached Dad since Houston flooded, but I am sure he&rsquo;s fine because no news is good news.</li>
<li>I am up to level 414 in Dots and Co.</li>
<li>I just heard the Welcome Back Kotter theme as muzak in a convenience store.</li>
<li>I just saw about 0.5 cubic meters of food being removed from that convenience store, in a garbage bag.</li>
<li>Why don&rsquo;t we have teleporters which can send food to places that it&rsquo;s needed?</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t talked to Fred in a bit.  I&rsquo;ll email him now.</li>
<li>From Fred: We were fine, got some rain and my car smelled like
mildew for a few days, and that was it. Dad was also fine. Katy&rsquo;s
house in Houston flooded, as you may have seen on FB, and they are in
an apartment for the next several months.  (by &ldquo;got some rain&rdquo; i mean
it was really fucking rainy, high winds and zero visibility when
passing 18-wheelers, and i had three inches of rain inside my car for
four days.)</li>
<li>AB said I did some work for them which was my idea and not their request.  I still haven&rsquo;t learned what work they mean.  (Upgrading Ubunutu server?)</li>

<ol>
<li>Lin, Ma, and I just got home from Nagano</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s raining harder than it does during the misnamed/mistimed &ldquo;rainy
season&rdquo; of the past couple of years.</li>
<li>I recently created <a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/">https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/</a> to be the MKP website for Tokyo / Japan.</li>
<li>Takeshi has talked about starting a Japanese-language men&rsquo;s group (on Saturdays)</li>
<li>I need to sort out different languages for the site (currently compiled by Hugo)</li>
<li>mypowercircle.org is currently only in English.  I do not know what Japanese content I can add while testing, but I think Takeshi will be the first to write Japanese for the site.</li>
<li>I will email him now.</li>
<li>Have recently re-started messing with XCode and trying to get our apps to work in latest iOS <del>garbage</del> version</li>
<li>Hugo keeps saying too many open files and the solutions here don&rsquo;t help <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/168">https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/168</a></li>
<li>Yay I got it working with <code>hugo server --watch=false</code></li>
<li>We have one cat (Jennie) and no other animals nor kids</li>
<li>We have lots of plants though. I basically just have Alex and his progeny</li>
<li>One of Alex&rsquo;s leaves seems to be taking root near the corner of the park at the top of the steps</li>
<li>The new Odakyu Line in Noborito had rails but recently <em>removed them again!!</em></li>
<li>We talk to Ma about once a week</li>
<li>We talk to dad less frequently; he always seems to be busy</li>
<li>We may go see Lin&rsquo;s dad this year</li>
<li>I have the AB hard drive to try to get old data off the drive</li>
<li>I am sure the data does not exist, but gosh if it does that would be great</li>
<li>At this point, Marble Track 3 movie is in two parts, totaling like 1 minute 50 seconds <a href="https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2017/08/16/mt3-playlist-mt3-movie-so-far/">https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2017/08/16/mt3-playlist-mt3-movie-so-far/</a></li>
<li>The playlist in the link above may get more / longer videos.</li>
<li><a href="https://mt3.robnugen.com">https://mt3.robnugen.com</a> should show the latest video or news</li>
<li>I plan to work on MT3 a bit tomorrow.</li>
<li>Ma is leaving on Tuesday.  It has been such a quick visit!</li>
<li>I just emailed Takeshi and note that I am 25 messages behind inbox 0 (not counting 173 starred messages</li>
<li>bah</li>
<li>About to try first attempt at Japanese on mypowercircle site via <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/">https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/</a></li>

<h2 id="20-50-monday-31-july-2017-jst">20:50 Monday 31 July 2017 JST</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Today was the first day to teach at a restaurant in Hiroo. 10
students, most of whom are beginners, but all were able to get
through some language, including, but not punctuated as, &ldquo;how many
in your party please follow me here you are here is the menu what
would you like to drink please let me know when you are ready to
order&rdquo; and &ldquo;this is sirloin sukiyaki may I help you prepare it we
recommend rare but how would you like it cooked this is our
original sauce dip the sirloin in egg wrap it around rice and
enjoy&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Today was the second of five nights I substituted for Patrick at
AK.  At first, Eiko told me about how job and drew some pictures of
how plastic containers are made.  Then I reviewed the homework at
Mifuyu&rsquo;s request and suggested an article which she tried to print,
but wasn&rsquo;t able to, so I will print it and bring a copy next week.</p></li>

<li><p>Today is the first day back after the Gunma trip.  We have been
talking about it on FB; there were quite a few problems, but the
proprietor has been clear in how most of them were not her fault,
so it is hard for me to give further feedback.</p></li>

<li><p>I plan to do it, though; probably via email.</p></li>

<li><p>Goodness I almsot just fell asleep.  (I plan to leave that
misspelling of almost because it is indicative of my state.) I am
currently on the train headed to our station from Noborito, but I
was up at 5:10am or so and have not yet caught up on sleep after
the weekend.</p></li>

<li><p>I just realized that next week is the mikoshi thing but I do not
want to go.  I would rather join SOGO at the beach.  I need to RSVP
for SOGO, so if I forget to do that, I will do the mikoshi thing in
Kawasaki.  Gosh it would be a bummer to miss the beach.</p></li>

<li><p>Next station is my destination.</p></li>

<li><p>Today I missed my destination by two bus stops.  Then I went back
but missed it again, not knowing that on the way back the bus stop
names are not aligned across the street.</p></li>

<li><p>I have done 13 hours on Marble Track 3.  I plan to work on it
tomorrow.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not done enough work work recently (according to part of my
brain) so I plan to work some on paid website work this Friday and
Saturday.</p></li>

<li><p>Good to talk to Steve yesterday about IT stuff while he drove us
home (and dropped me off in Takasaki station)</p></li>

<li><p>Tomorrow night is the 1st or 3rd Tuesday of the month, so
therefore men&rsquo;s group.  Oh, I made a website
<a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/">https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/</a> I think it should be mkptokyo or
mkpjapan or tokyo.mkpjapan maybe.</p></li>

<li><p>We have one cat (Jennie) and no other pets or kids or anything.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not drawn any art for a long time.  I still own
amazeaweek.net but have not touched it nor wiki.robnugen.com for
quite a while.</p></li>

<li><p>Dealing with the aftermath of our Gunma trip may take a while, but
I am optimistic for getting it done by next week.</p></li>

<li><p>I walked from Tokyo Tower to Shibuya station today (with teaching
at the restaurant as a two hour pit stop in the middle)</p></li>

<li>I completed 40 frames of animation yesterday with new camera and
trial version of DragonFrame.  I think I will buy a license for
it.  One big question at this point is how to handle N*10^6 images
in the final project.</li>
<li>I am currently headed to SOGO (Suns Out Guns Out) an exercise group
I joined late last year, like in September I guess.  I only go on
Sundays, but there are other activities people do every day of the
week.  I am most interested in rock climbing, but I teach Sarumama
on Mondays when the rock climbing group meets.</li>
<li>I started messing around with Mailchimp again to set up reminders
before meetings, but have not completed it yet.. They do not have a
way to send out mails every 1st and 3rd Tuesday, which is what I
want.  I got messages to send via their API, but have not connected
it to cron yet on my server.  So close; why did I not finish?  I am
an expert at not finishing projects.</li>
<li>I plan to meet Tariq today after SOGO.  We want to upgrade our iOS
apps to latest and &ldquo;greatest&rdquo; version of iOS and XCode, the
steaming pile of okay well I have not used XCode 9 yet, but I
assume it will be just as annoying as always.</li>
<li>Interesting to think about how I like to take pictures of
construction over time, I am doing a stop action animation project,
and I am planning to write (in reverse) a
<del>book</del><ins>story</ins> within commit messages of these
journal entries.  This is the first time I have mentioned it in the
content of my journal and not the commit messages.  All of these
seem like stop motion animation to me. I must be fascinated with
changes over time or something.</li>
<li>Lin wants to buy a new mattress and to clean my room.  Cleaning my
room took priority over the mattress, so I am curious as to how
much she really wants a new mattress.  It&rsquo;s my fucking room; forget
about it.</li>
<li>We have been calling my mom every week. I should call Dad too.
Shit it is fathers day this Sunday I think.  That is today here and
tomorrow there.</li>
<li>The co-gender circle has had 3 meetings; we are going through
Kauth&rsquo;s book <em>A Circle of Men</em>.  There may be some new men joining
the men&rsquo;s circle soon.</li>
<li>I bought domain name mypowercircle.org and authenticcircles.org but
have not done anything with them except redirect to
<a href="https://tokyo">https://tokyo</a>. in each case.</li>
<li>Abbrevs because arrived and gotta get off train.</li>
<li>Just switched trains in Yoyogi Uehara to the Chiyoda Line, on
which Helma used to live before she got kicked out of the
country for overstaying her visa.  #srsbzns</li>
<li>We have one cat (Jennie), zero kids, zero other animals, a lot of
plants, including a bit of a garden with herbs (Lin&rsquo;s hard work),
a subscription to milk delivery (just like old times except with
cartons instead of bottles) and occaional meal-ingredient
delivery.</li>
<li>I have recently bought a new laptop cooler for my 5 yo Macbook.</li>
<li>9:57am Just arrived in Meiji-Jingu-Mae/Harajuku so see ya after SOGO<br /></li>

<li>I am downstairs in Wendes/First Kitchen in Shibuya, and Tariq will
arrive soon.  There are outlets available.  I am super low on cash
right now, but I had enough for a chicken burger, and I have
enough to get back home.</li>

<ol>
<li>I met Caroline, who seems to be a soul I&rsquo;ve met in previous lifetime(s)</li>
<li>Two men might join Tokyo men&rsquo;s circle, which would put us up to 5 (cause it seems <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> men have stopped coming)</li>
<li>A woman is interested in joining Tokyo co-gender circle.  That will put us up to 7 if all 6 people come next time.</li>
<li>Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle meetings are on 1st and 3rd Tuesdays each month.</li>
<li>Tokyo Co-gender Circle meets on 2nd and 4th Tuesday each month.</li>
<li>I am the contact person for both</li>
<li>We have had two (2) co-gender group meetings so far.</li>
<li>The short term plan is to keep going and keep inviting new people into the circles</li>
<li>Medium term goal is to find enough people interested in learning how to do facilitation that it makes sense for us to have a facilitation trainer come in and teach for a weekend.</li>
<li>Long term goal is to have women leaders lead the co-gender circle as a women&rsquo;s circle</li>
<li>Vision is to reduce the number of suicides in Japan by giving people a safe place to talk about their feelings.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m on the local train now headed home from CB</li>
<li>We are planning to switch their servers over to new servers tomorrow.  Hopefully it will go smoothly.</li>
<li>I plan to do final testing tonight; I need to compare a buncha URIs on each server to make sure the content is exactly the same (JSON).</li>
<li>Yay(?)</li>
<li>Before the great server-swap, I plan to meet Caroline for a private session.  I have kinda been thinking of questions but have not written them down yet.</li>
<li>* How can I act more loving toward Lin?</li>
<li>* Am I on track with current diet or should I be even more careful than recently?</li>
<li>* What did you mean when you said I was healthy?</li>
<li>* How can I align my heart with income?</li>
<li>* how much time should I spend on Marble Track 3?</li>
<li>* What else are you inspired to tell me?</li>
<li>I am currently level 24 in Pokemon Go.  I plan to get to Level 25 so I can zoom through a bunch of Evolutions while I have a Special Egg or whatever.</li>
<li>I have not touched iOS apps with Tariq for a while; they are well overdue for updates.</li>
<li>I have been working on Marble Track 3 each Tuesday, though I probably will <em>not</em> work on it tomorrow.  I am making a choice to meet with Caroline and then do the server upgrade with CB, which will probably eat up all my time before I-group.  Boo hoo to a degree, but I really think I should have had the upgrades done by now, had shit not gone awry.</li>
<li>Oh, so anyway, MT3 so far has zero (0) photos taken for the stop animation portion.  But I did buy a nice camera..  ohhhh that is what I can do.  Between CB and Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle tomorrow, I plan to go buy a tripod for the camera.</li>
<li>I bought mypowercircle.org and authenticcircles.org about 10 days ago, but have not put anything on them.  I will probably end up using tokyo.mypowercircle.org and let the other domain go bye-bye.  Thanks to Paola for (correctly) suggesting that a real domain is better than a Facebook Group.  More legit, more exandable, more reassuring, more work, more fun.</li>
<li>I have been sort-kinda steady-state low-key studying Japanese, taking up to three (3) lessons per week.  but during server upgrade madness, I had not been doing homework. I did a teeny bit of homework before recent lesson with Fumiko.</li>
<li>庭にワニは鶏を食べた。Why has no one offered me this variant? I just made it up after hearing some other kids practice the conventional version.</li>

<li>I wonder why I&rsquo;m writing an SOML now before the end of the month. Usually they are on the first, or recently, late, or very late.</li>
<li>Lin and I are watching Alien Domicile, and I cannot say I am really expecting much.</li>
<li>For time considerations, I abandoned upgrading to Ubuntu 16.  Updating all my projects to use PHP 7 <em>and</em> figure out Ansible was too much.  Upgrading to only Ubuntu 14 allows me to stay with PHP 5 and just focus on Ansible</li>
<li>And recently, focus on creating a new VM for use locally</li>
<li>Because I unexpectedly killed connectivity to my former local VM and needed to recreate it.</li>
<li>Lin will soon go to her second meeting regarding purchase of 1000万円 company.  This time with a CPA to evaluate its expected future value.</li>
<li>I have not done anything with the three styrofoam blocks I bought at the beginning of the month.</li>
<li>We just bailed on Alien Domicile after Lin was like &ldquo;meh&rdquo; and I confirmed our suspicions with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6574700/reviews">these reviews</a></li>
<li>We are watching an introduction to Bitcoin!  I hope Lin will be more interested in BTC after this.</li>
<li>Aw man.  She was like &ldquo;meh&rdquo; despite my passionate plea that she try to understand the future potential.</li>
<li>Now we are watching Secret Life of Pets</li>

<li>Lin and I are on our way to meet Tariq who will tell us what
questions to ask of the business owner who offered to sell Lin her
business for １０００万円</li>
<li>I got a surprise phone call the other day: &ldquo;Hey Rob can I talk to
Lin?&rdquo; and offered the idea of selling to Lin.</li>
<li>My first reaction is no way because I have no biz skizzles, no
interest, and am too busy.</li>
<li>Been working on Ansible playbooks to get servers upgraded to Ubuntu
16.04.  Fred helped me with some Bash script to backup historical
monthly database snapshots in year-sized bundles.</li>
<li>I recently e-met Mike in Oregon who is the first person I have
written who had an answer to how to sponsor a community in MKP.</li>
<li>This past Tuesday, I presented Head Heart and Soul for the second
time in Tokyo.  Several of the people I invited canceled at the
last minute, but mostly thanks to Roh, we had 11 participants, 8 of whom
had not seen the event the first time.  One of the men in
attendance has expressed interest in joining Tokyo men&rsquo;s circle.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s cold today, and rainy.  Is it always this cold on April 1st or
is the weather trying to fool us?  No, it&rsquo;s just trying to cool us.</li>
<li>I bought 3 styrofoam blocks which I intend to convert into stairs
for Jennie to climb down from the balcony without cracking the
sunroom roof.  They are currently in my room, waiting to be assembled.</li>
<li>Assembly is probably easy, but affixing them to the roof without
affecting the roof is the trick.
10.I knocked Noisy off my bedside table last night, and its battery
came out.  I guess if I tie a string to it so it won&rsquo;t hit the
floor, I can pull it back up without waking up too much, and
possibly the battery won&rsquo;t bounce out.
11.Lin is super happy with her work; she is freelance-ish with what used to be an annoying full time job.
she was like &ldquo;I quit&rdquo; and they go &ldquo;okay okay okay you can skip the
annoying bits and just do what you like!&rdquo;
12.I have been learning lots with my work while doing a big project
due at the end of April..
13.plus doing my men&rsquo;s group; I am leading Tokyo men&rsquo;s circle, a place to get shit off our proverbial chests
14.And I just went to the dentist today
15.and had a 2 mile flat ground barefoot hike to meet my friend at The Pink Cow!</li>

<li>The US shifted their clocks forward, so my online I-group now meets at 9:30am Tokyo time.  That means I do not have enough time to head home before the meeting, and that means I need to find Wifi.  I&rsquo;ve been using Wired Cafe in Lazona, and I will probably resume.  It also means I have my computer with me for this morning lesson to which students are often late.</li>
<li>Been doing lots of work for AB.  Added a field.. actually split a field into two pieces.  I thought date_available and date_marketable were the same.  False.  Well they have been the same in the DB for 6 years, so kinda true.</li>
<li>While doing all that work, I should be preparing to move them to Ubuntu 16.04</li>
<li>Apparently the CB project will end in June.  I hope it&rsquo;s not foolish to hope it&rsquo;s conceivable that it could possibly go smoothly.  Just sayin&rsquo; I miss having a project manager who can push back against certain requests.</li>
<li>I just taught a trial lesson yesterday for It&rsquo;s Me.  They were beginners, but genki and tried pretty hard.  First lesson starts a month from now; have to wait for new annual business cycle to start.</li>
<li>I gave a copy of Simon&rsquo;s book to Patrick.</li>
<li>TY had a baby!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been going to SOGO since like August 2016.  I just invited Menya to my HHS presentation on March 28th.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be presenting Head Heart and Soul on March 28th.  It&rsquo;s basically an introduction into the type of emotional clearing / personal growth we do in my men&rsquo;s group.</li>
<li>I built a cage with chopsticks to surround my glass desk with a protective cat shield.  Inside the cage (which can be easily removed by people with thumbs (haha, cat!)), I plan to make a marble track.  Expect it to start soon after April.</li>
<li>In addition to weekly online I-group, I attend monthly I-group council call (being the representative for all the I-group<del>s</del> in Japan), and monthly Community Growth call (being that Japan has only one I-group).</li>
<li>One of the things suggested by the Community Growth team is to have patience.</li>
<li>I have not been meditating regularly.</li>
<li>I just started bringing my disk to SOGO so we can throw a bit after workout.  Only one taker 12 days ago, but about 4 people this past Sunday.</li>
<li>Student just arrived 11 minutes late.</li>

<li>The morning weather was 2 degrees C, basically too cold for me to happily go barefoot, but it got up to 12 C today, which is relatively great barefoot weather.</li>
<li>I really enjoy teaching students who enjoy learning.  I wonder how long I can do it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been watching Mythbusters on Netflix.  I&rsquo;m up to Season 4 now I think.  Interesting that Scottie just vanished from episodes, replaced by Grant without fanfare.  I hope she left on good terms.</li>

<li>I&rsquo;ve staffed 3 <a href="https://nwta.mkp.org/">NWTAs</a> for <a href="https://mkp.org/">Mankind Project</a>.  Most recent two were in Perth, in October 2016 and October 2015.</li>
<li>on 31 January, I presented Tokyo&rsquo;s first Head Heart and Soul presentation, as suggested by John Gaughan in Perth last year.</li>
<li>14 people in attendance and great supportive response</li>
<li>There are 6 men in the Toyo I-group, including 3 men who have not yet attended NWTA.</li>
<li>I expect the group to expand to as many as 9 men in the next month or two.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d like to consider running circles on more nights, and possibly co-gender groups as well, to help introduce women in Tokyo to <a href="https://www.womanwithin.org/">Woman Within</a></li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been invited to attend monthly I-group Council meetings, as the representative for Tokyo I-groups.</li>
<li>Today is the first week I used Noisy to wake up for my Thursday morning lesson.</li>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t (yet?) made an entry for Noisy in &ldquo;Items&rdquo; category of my wiki</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve nearly finished my cage to keep Jennie off my desk which will soon have my marble track under construction.</li>
<li>I plan to do a stop-action animation so it will look like little pipe-cleaner people made the track.</li>
<li>I also plan to livestream the building of the track, which will take <em>ages</em>.</li>
