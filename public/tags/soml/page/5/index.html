<h2 id="16-32-wednesday-04-february-2015-jst">16:32 Wednesday 04 February 2015 JST</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>TL;DR: I&rsquo;m really happy with my situation right now.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m working for a few different people/companies, going to
different places each day.  Mostly I&rsquo;m teaching English, but also
doing website work for AB and probably do some more website work for a
different project, &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>On new moon weekends, I&rsquo;ve been attending
<a href="www.meetup.com/Tokyo-ET-Contact-Group/">Tokyo ET Contact</a> meetups,
organized by Mark, and on some other weekends, I&rsquo;ve been attending
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Reiki-Circle/">Tokyo Reiki Circle</a>
meetups.  When there&rsquo;s a conflict, I go with ET group because it&rsquo;s
only once a month.</p></li>

<li><p>Otherwise, I have a lot of free time to fitz around with my
website, chat with Fred online, make art, meditate, and play with the
cats.</p></li>

<li><p>Oh, and free time to do laundry and think about cleaning and cooking!</p></li>

<li><p>Lin is back in real estate, coming home each night saying she had a
good day.  I&rsquo;m super happy about that!</p></li>

<li><p>Lin seems to only be able to relax if the house is clean, which I
know, but don&rsquo;t really understand.  I&rsquo;m often like, &ldquo;yo baby don&rsquo;t
worry about it&rdquo; and sometimes help her clean, but egad it already
seems clean enough to me!  Plus it&rsquo;s just gonna get dirty again
anyway!</p></li>

<li><p>We have a subscription to Hulu and watch movies on it pretty
regularly; maybe 3 per week.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m considering moving from Hakyll to Pelican since I&rsquo;m
too&hellip; lazy/disinterested in learning Haskell, and my knight in
programming armor has gotten too busy to add the extras to what he
made already.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m still evaluating Pelican, though.  Need to make sure I can
make it do the things I want, which I haven&rsquo;t necessarily defined
well.</p>

<p>a. pagination
b. calendar
c. Dream CSS
d. tags
e. categories
f. date based on filename and meta data
g. images
h. Unity apps</p></li>

<li><p>1% chance I will split my non-art categories from my wiki to static
pages on my site.  Actually yeah that&rsquo;s a pretty good idea; the only
reason I have art on wiki is so that other people can edit the pages
for the particular piece they obtained. So let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a 2% chance
= 100% chance I think it&rsquo;s a great idea now * <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> ability to
prioritize it anytime soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I think I&rsquo;ll make a category called &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; or something; it
can hold my R.O.B.O.T. pages and other crap I pooped out some years
ago.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve switched robnugen.com to use www.robnugen.com; Travis
explained that having domain names which are substrings of other
domain names is a (Javascript?) security hole.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m going to let airplaneday.com and isfuzzywilltravel.com expire;
I&rsquo;ve not don&rsquo;t shit with those domains in years so they&rsquo;re just
wasting money.  Oh, and pekoneko.com.  That was for Hitomi.</p></li>

<li><p>I want to evaluate my robnugen.com subdomains.  Some of them are
shit; some are empty.  I will move each one to its own (virtual)
server, or wipe it off the proverbial face of the internet.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>1.
Definitely want to keep the following:</p>

<pre><code>a. wiki.robnugen.com (for my art)
b. art.robnugen.com (shortlinks to my art)
c. www.robnugen.com (blog and shit (hopefully all static))
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>without looking at what exists, I can&rsquo;t think of any others I care about.</p></li>

<li><p>I was going to be in a drug trial at CPC for the first two weeks of
this month (Feb 2015) but I wasn&rsquo;t selected after passing the initial
medical check.  I guess it was a lottery-type selection process.</p></li>

<li><p>Tariq and I have switched to Unity for further app
development. It&rsquo;s become clear that I&rsquo;m unable to keep up with the iOS
updates, plus I&rsquo;m definitely not able to write for Android, etc, while
writing for iOS so we&rsquo;re hoping Unity can help deploy to multiple
platforms.</p></li>

<li><p>So far, I&rsquo;ve just done the first roll-a-ball tutorial, and expanded
on that a little bit.  I&rsquo;ve not even figured out a cool and consistent
way to &hellip; oh I know.. there&rsquo;s gotta be a reasonable way to do it with
Pelican.  I just want to slap the files on my site, optionally with
links to source code.</p></li>

<li><p>I read on Reddit someone suggesting that <em>all</em> software will be
open source in the future.  I guess it&rsquo;s a nice idea, and I hope it
comes to pass, but I dunno.  Smert algorithms could keep up with the
pace of development without the need for an army of devs + testers.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m happy to open source any programming projects I write on my
own, but interestingly, I&rsquo;m not yet willing to open source my art.
I&rsquo;m not sure why, though.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I live in Kawasaki.  I&rsquo;ve sent four (4) postcards on
<a href="https://www.postcrossing.com/">postcrossing.com</a>, and received two
(2).</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve sent a few emails encrypted with PGP (GPG) extension on
Thunderbird.  Still haven&rsquo;t quite sorted out how to do all the key
(signing) business, but it&rsquo;s definitely interesting stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to some of Andrew Basiago&rsquo;s statements about
the future come to pass.</p></li>

<li><p>I have taught a few substitute lessons at Toshiba, but don&rsquo;t yet
have a consistent schedule there.  They&rsquo;ve got some really interesting
exhibits, about which I enjoy learning more.</p></li>

<li><p>We have two cats (Jennie and Ted), but zero dogs or kids.  Jennie
and Ted are getting along pretty well, and have been peeing in their
designated place for a while.  I would love to let them outside, but
we agreed upon their adoption that we&rsquo;d keep them inside, safe from
city life.</p></li>

<li><p>I pretty regularly can &ldquo;pop&rdquo; my neck, by tilting my head
backwards.  I&rsquo;m sue that&rsquo;s a symptom of &lsquo;text neck&rsquo;, so I&rsquo;ve been
trying to maintain better posture, but it&rsquo;s hard to do so with my
current lifestyle.</p></li>

<li><p>I don&rsquo;t have a train pass because I don&rsquo;t use the trains enough
times in a month to make it worthwhile.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven&rsquo;t spoken with my dad in a bit; maybe I&rsquo;ll try to connect
with him soon.</p></li>

<li><p>Holy shit I just saw a Japanese(?) couple embrace with long hug
and passionate kiss.  They hugged for more than like 15 seconds each
time, and he held her face and kissed her.  So happy for them!</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p>TLDR: I&rsquo;ve been a lazy bum recently.  And I love it.</p></li>

<li><p>Maybe the coolest thing recently: Mutsumi introduced me to
Funatsu-san, who liked my art and asked if she can put some in a
show in January!</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been teaching a few lessons per week with a language school,
but other than that, doing a lot of Minecraft, and drawing a few
mazes.  With the news above, I&rsquo;m more excited to make some art!</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I live in Kawasaki with our two cats, Ted and Jennie, who
are currently not allowed to go outside nor sleep with us at night.
I&rsquo;d love to let them outside, but Lin agreed with the shelter that
she will keep them inside.  We had let them sleep with us, but one
of them urinated on Lin&rsquo;s comforter so they&rsquo;ve lost their bedroom
priveleges.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m arriving now at a train station where I need to change; I might
forget about this entry.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve just moved from AWS to DH.  Due to a blip in Dreamhost&rsquo;s DNS
something something, I had to write to them to get the site
activated; I think it&rsquo;s working now, and I Stopped the EC2
instance.</p></li>

<li><p>Because I&rsquo;m using markdown to mark up my journal, I don&rsquo;t have to
use the actual number when creating numbered lists.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m sitting in the driver&rsquo;s seat of a driverless train on the
Seaside Line, heading to 福浦.  (I guess that kanji is correct.)
This is what driverless cars might feel like, except my insulated
environment (in the train) is inside an insulated environment
(elevated roadway with limited public access)</p></li>

<li><p>Hmm.  I don&rsquo;t see a way to make multiple paragraphs within one
numbered section.</p></li>

<li><p>From this train, I can see a large wind turbine, which I htink is
the same one I could see from our previous apartment (in 朝日町ハイツ)</p></li>

<li><p>Oh shit I see the line splits; I hope to goodness that I&rsquo;m on the
right track!!!  Ah, I guess that&rsquo;s not for public use; the line
drawn on the map is just a straight line with no branches.</p></li>

<li><p>This is more like a stream of consiousness thing instead of a State
of My Life.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m still using my iPHone 4S which I&rsquo;ve had for a while. The
battery has been draining a bit faster than I&rsquo;d like.  I thought I
had all the energy-drainers turned off, but maybe not.  Maybe the
battery is just getting tired.  My phone number is the same one
I&rsquo;ve had for years in Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>Main work projects: unpaid iOS work with Tariq (though we are
hoping for some sales with our latest set up updates)</p></li>

<li><p>Every time I use my computer for longish periods of time, my hands
get cold.  Especially my mouse hand.  I imagine taht&rsquo;s a good
reason to <em>not</em> do computer stuff for longish periods of time.  Is
it my body&rsquo;s way of telling me to stop it altogether? Or shall I
just set up a more ergonomic setup?</p></li>

<li><p>I need to convert AB&rsquo;s EC2 instance to two instances: one for DB
and one for the website.  I&rsquo;m guessing the DB can be behind a
firewall; I don&rsquo;t know the optimal way to set it up, much less the
optimal way to transition to that new configuration.  I&rsquo;ll
basically just rtfm, and maybe some toots, and hopefully it will be
all good.  AND I&rsquo;ll document the proverbial shit out of everything
I do.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve got emacs set up to create journal entries, though I don&rsquo;t
have the final touches set up.  I mean I can type <code>C-x j</code> to start
a new entry, and it will even ask for the title, tags, and let me
overwrite the date if needed.  However, if I do overwrite the date,
I&rsquo;d like it to put the date I enter and add a note saying the
actual date the entry was written.  I don&rsquo;t yet have a keystroke
way to insert a new date in the middle of the text, but that&rsquo;s not
as high priority as having entries named &ldquo;dream&rdquo; automagically get
class=&lsquo;dream&rsquo; divs wrapped around the text.  I had that kinda stuff
set up before, but I don&rsquo;t know where the code may be hiding.  It
could even be lurking around on my current local drive, but I&rsquo;m not
sure.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven&rsquo;t written any automated stuff to have Sublime do journal
entries, partially because I haven&rsquo;t registered (paid for) Sublime
yet (and therefore don&rsquo;t use it much).</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I went to the Tokyo ET Contact group in November, and plan
to go again in December.  I&rsquo;m hoping to attend most of the
meetings; I want to foster relations between our civilizations.  I
want a degree in intergalactic diplomacy (or at least intergalactic
relations)!</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m scheduled to go to CPC clinic in February; not sure if I&rsquo;ll do
it though.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I are planning to take a <del>reasonably</del>
<ins>vaguely</ins> long bicycle ride during the new year holidays.
No specific plans yet.</p></li>

<li><p>I need to go to 二子玉川 to get (one of) her Christmas
present(s). (I promised her a Harrod&rsquo;s bear each year that we don&rsquo;t
have kids.)</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been using some of my free time to meditate more and maintain
awareness of consciousness.  I haven&rsquo;t noticed any &ldquo;amazing&rdquo;
experiences, not that conciousness itself isn&rsquo;t amazing.</p></li>

<li><p>Been working with Soness a bit to help get her paperwork sorted.
It&rsquo;s fun to chat with her more often than we had been for the past
couple years.</p></li>

<li><p>I ain&rsquo;t really talked with Dad in a while, nor with Ma.  Nor with
Fred, for that matter; he and I used to talk just about every day
for a couple months there.  I sent him a present and it&rsquo;s been
chillin&rsquo; at the post office in Austin (I can tell from the
tracking website); he must be busy!  I sent him a reminder and he
was like, &ldquo;oh yeah!!&rdquo;</p></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>From my perspective, at a larger scale:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We still live primarily in a fiat currency based system.  Some
crypto currencies have been developed on &ldquo;the blockchain&rdquo;
(Bitcoin, Litecoin, probably others), and some other similar
currencies have been developed, my favorite being Dogecoin.</p></li>

<li><p>We still primarily burn fossil fuels for energy.  There are
whistleblowers online saying free energy is possible, but hidden
from public access.</p></li>

<li><p>We still primarily use &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; methods of
transportation. There&rsquo;s not even a specific word that I know of to
describe transportation not via teleportation.</p></li>

<li><p>Extraterrestrial life has not been publicly acknowledged by (most?)
governments.</p></li>

<li><p>Earthquakes are officially not predictable.  Weather is not
particularly changeable (that I know of, except by cloud seeding
to make it rain)</p></li>

<p>The very best thing about not using Wordpress or Hoken: I can repeat filenames and not have the URLs get mangled.</p>

<p>#State of My Life Address#</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I ain&rsquo;t journaled consistently for a long time.</p></li>

<li><p>I hope to become more consistent for years to come.</p></li>

<li><p>THis SOML might get cut short, though; Lin is about to arrive in 8 minutes.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I are married, living in Kawasaki, Japan.  We live in a two story house (paying rent, moe joe, but it&rsquo;s more space and less rent than our apartment was) and her mom lives downstairs.</p></li>

<li><p>We have two cats, Ted and Jennie.  Lin named Ted, and I named Jennie after Jennifer, who found a place for Spot to live after I left the US for Japan.</p></li>

<li><p>I have vaguely good ability to understand basic spoken Japanese, but am losing my ability to speak Japanese.  I&rsquo;ve been here 11+ years and it&rsquo;s starting to get embarrassing, but it just proves how lazy I am and how easy it is to live in a bubble here.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been going around barefoot as much as possible for the last two years.  I&rsquo;m barefoot now, sitting in Kawasaki station as I wait for Lin to arrive.</p></li>

<li><p>Lin has just told me she&rsquo;ll be working for HJ starting in January.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve not worked full time in a while.  I stopped working at Accent after pissing off the boss at the other Accent by allegedly sexually harassing an employee, but really it was in jest and not meant in any kind of sexy way.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying being a <del>lazy bum</del> er house husband, though I&rsquo;m working a bit here and there.</p></li>

<li><p>TJ Bike and I still ride around a bit, but his chain is rusty.  I often ride Lin&rsquo;s bike just because it&rsquo;s lighter.</p></li>

<li><p>We&rsquo;ve considered taking some long rides; we rode to her friend Mika&rsquo;s house a month ago or so ago, and planned to ride to Paola&rsquo;s after that, and Sourou&rsquo;s after that, and then an overnight adventure after that, but havne&rsquo;t done anything beyond riding to Mika&rsquo;s.</p></li>

<li><p>I plan to attend the next Tokyo ET communication night thing on 22 November.  Find the meetup group if you&rsquo;re interested, but please understand that on the first time, you won&rsquo;t be meeting ET close encounters style.  Might see some twinkling lights or whatnot.  (That&rsquo;s what I expect, but I probably need to drop even that expectiaton)</p></li>

<li><p>Tariq and I have teamed up with Christina in New York (I was just kidding when I called her <em>The Christina</em> a couple days ago) who does social network stuff.</p></li>

<li><p>We&rsquo;ve got three apps ready to release, but want to build up some excitement first.  I&rsquo;m super excited, but not sure if anything is really going to happen.  I&rsquo;ll let you know.</p></li>

<li><p>In the cat+computer room, Lin put down some <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch foam rubber flooring. which the cats love to claw.  It&rsquo;s proving to be an excellent investment in keeping their claws off the walls!</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve got four mazes queued up for <a href="https://www.amazeaweek.net/">A Maze a Week</a>, but one is scheduled to go out tonight.</p></li>

<li><p>I just fixed the tab key on my keyboard.  It had gotten sticky and didn&rsquo;t travel quickly each time I pressed it.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is &ldquo;Silver Monkey&rdquo;, a Macbook Pro about 2.5 years old.  I think it has a 15&rdquo; monitor.  It&rsquo;s running Yosemite (OS X 10.10)</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been so anti-impressed with Apple for the past 2.25 years that I am sure I&rsquo;ll not buy another Mac with my own monies.   When this one starts to get tired of the OS upgrades, I&rsquo;ll switch to Ubuntu.</p></li>

<li><p>My phone is &ldquo;Little Blue Monkey&rdquo;, an iPhone 4S with iOS 7.1.</p></li>

<p>Tazura is a beautiful weimereiner, but I think weimereiners are beautiful by definition.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t yet know how to organize our android app.</p>

<p>I finished my first Roy G Biv hex maze today. Just need to scan it.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll attend Kevin&rsquo;s advanced shamanism course, day 1 of 4 of advanced practice. I guess I should practice on my own as well as attend his classes.</p>

<p>I feel conflicted; I want to keep working on the Android project for work.</p>

<pre>
Wende and I are separating. We are both sad, and
continuing to communicate and stuff as we split up.  

You may know that I have never lived alone (and not
been seriously dating someone) since I got out of high
school.  I'm choosing to live alone and be flat single
and not available for relationship for a while.  (like
a year at very minimum)

We intend to not sell the house right now; one of us
will live in it and the other will be in an apartment.
 It appears that I'll be living in the house, but
that's not clear yet.   For now, we will live as
roommates (I'm in the downstairs bedroom) until we
save up a few dollars so she can move out.

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Wende and I are leaving for Australia tomorrow!
 I've had my passport since Costa Rica in November
1998.  Wende just got her passport last Thursday.  I
got our ETA (Electronic Ticket Authorities (visas)) on
Friday night.</p></li>
 
<li><p>We've started beeper duty at work.  I just had
it for a week and will give it to Dave tomorrow
morning.  It was my first duty at this work and it was
quite easy.  I think there were only 2 errors and they
were fixed by Patrick.</p></li>
 
<li><p>I just got my new (replacement) Handspring
Visor.  Its color is called "ice", and it's vaguely
translucent.  I'm using it and my Targus Stowaway
Keyboard to type this entry.</p>

<p>I replaced it because the other one was draining
batteries ridiculously quickly.</p></li>
 
<li><p>I still have not determined exactly how many
hours difference is between Houston and Melbourne.  I
want to know so I can have a dual time framework for
my entries.</p></li>
 
<li><p>I'm youth advisor for Northwoods youth group. 
Their youth Sunday is this coming Sunday, and I will
sadly miss it due to our trip.  They said they will
record it for me to watch though.  :-)</p></li>
 
<li><p>At work I have been working on making the big
big project generic so it can handle many different
surveys at once, using the same compiled code.</p>

<p>I have just given Kevin the overview of the Ritz
project, which I have made generic and called the OG
project.  That code is already written so the same
compiled code can run multiple projects.  It will be
great to see it work in production.</p></li>
 
<li><p>Wende and I have 3 cats:  Spot, my cool cat,
Tinkerbell, her white long hair princess kitty, and
Peter, her gordo tabby.</p>

<p>They are 5.5, 7, and 8 years old
respectively.</p></li>
 
<li><p>I have collected some 71 snail mail addresses
to send postcards to people from down under.  I pulled
a lot of the addresses from my old school address
books entries, so I might not send cards to them all
if it becomes too expensive.  We'll just have to
see.</p></li>
 
<li><p>I'm greatly looking forward to Silent Football
with Bryn!</p></li>
 
<li><p>Wende and I are taking Spanish classes through
Leisure Learning Unlimited each Tuesday night.  We
will miss the 5th class meeting due to our trip.  (We
were able to take the 4th class early because she's
teaching a Monday night class as well, and they are a
week ahead of us.)
</p></li>

<li><p>The walls in our living room are still white
(in our whole house actually), but we have picked up a
bunch of color samples and will paint all kinds of
wacky colors sometime in March.</p></li>
 
 <li><p>At KTRU, I am sharing the Saturday night 7-9pm
shift with Donna.  I have met her now.</p></li>

<li><p>Wende and I might get new cell phones soon. 
Cingular is our current goal because they have
unlimited customer to customer talkin'.</p></li>
 
<li><p>Tomorrow I'm taking Scott to the doctor to fix
his leaky power steering, brakes, and air conditioner.
 The air conditioner has basically never worked since
I got the car 3 years ago, and the power steering
hasn't worked for a while.  the brakes went bad after
stupid Midas shop "fixed" them, but I never went back
to complain because they still worked kinda and I
didn't want to mess with it.</p>

<p>It will be like having a whole new car!</p></li>
 
<li><p>Wende and I have outdoor christmas lights
hanging from the rafters in our ceiling for a lovely
basking glow instead of the super bright
floodlights.</p>

<p>We bought them from Melissa from Wende's work for
$10</p></li>
 
<li><p>Wende and I are meeting with a marriage
counselor to help us work out any issues before we
actually got married.</p></li>

<li><p>Okay, according to my Visor, Melbourne is 17
hours ahead of us.  So as I write this at 11:11pm
Sunday here, it's 4:11pm Monday there.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>State of My Life Address</h1>

<ol>
<p><li>Erick Morrow has been killed.  He was apparently drunk and playing chicken with a car (a friend (also drunk) was driving)  one friend got out of the way of the car; Erick did not.

<p>He was a recently graduated YRUU youth.  A lot of peeps in the YRUU community are emotionally upset about it.

<p><li>I'm working on El Project - the coding is done; today we worked on getting the datasets all cleaned up.  I found no fewer than 40 repeated names and emails (similar or identical spellings) in the data they gave us.  Out of 900 correct names is that a good ratio?

<p><li>The family reunion was fun. (I've written a lot about it on my Visor) I just haven't moved the entries to my site yet.  I'm close.

<p>(17:28 just lost power for about 20 seconds. (a lot of lightning outside)  I'm thankful I was typing this on my Visor and not on computer.  Yay for smart thinking!)

<p><li>I got a pretty good amount of genealogical information from Wende's mom and (step)dad on the way home from family reunion.  Having this information makes me feel closer to the family and happier about the <em>marriage</em> and other things that might scare me.

<p><li>Oh!  I sent some pics to photoworks.com and got them back (electronically) today!  There are some of the Hazard Street bridge being built (that's the one by the tube through which I crawled) and some of me on unicycle and some funny ones of Tinkerbell inside Wende's shorts (while Wende was still in them too)

<p><li>BBST is still fun and silly!  Visit <a href="https://www.geeky-boy.com">https://www.geeky-boy.com</a> and tell us Thunder Rabbit sent you!

<p><li>Ultimate tonight if it's not raining.  Maybe not and I'll just sleep or watch a movie with Wende.

<p><p><li>Wende and I are almost unpacked into our new house.  I unpacked a couple of boxes yesterday.  Maybe we are not as far along as I think, but the end seems to be in sight!</p>

<p><p><li>We are DSL connected at our house!  My work is paying for it, which is way cool.  I was able to get Wende&rsquo;s computer connected, but have not yet gotten my linux box set up.  Seems that I need to do some more research to find a NIC that will work for it.</p>

<p><p><li>I have recently learned that full-sized collapsable keyboards are available for Palm Pilots!  That means I&rsquo;ll be able to much more easily write journal entries &lsquo;on the road&rsquo; and quickly get them online when I get back to an internet connection.  YAY!!</p>

<p><p><li>Wende and I plan to visit Australia in February 2001, so we may attend Irene and Nick&rsquo;s wedding.  (That reminds me that I need to tell work about vacation time I want to take for Youth Council in August and Australia in February.)</p>

<p><p><li>At work we have finally finished the big project we had been working on for months.  The new project has already started.</p>

<ol>
<p><li>Wende and I are engaged to be married!  Planned date is Friday 21 
June 2002.  Ceremony will be Friday evening by a lake, then stay in cabins 
overnight, then play all day Saturday!  Everyone we know will be invited!

<p><li>On more immediate time scale, we're in the process of purchasing a 
house!  Our offer/contract has been accepted, and our loan broker is 
searching for a loan for us.  Such excitement!  Closing date is 14 April. 
 Move in date is April 15 and 16.

<p><li>I am soon going to be working full time at my job.  I love my work! 
 Barefoot, shorts, rally t-shirts every day..  I'm working on a variety of 
projects and it's just great great great!

<p><li>KTRU is great fun - this is my 5th semester, counting summer and 
winter.  I've reviewed 60 CDs for KTRU!!

<p><li>I'm in the process of cleaning up my apartment so I can pack up my 
junk, and so my landlord can show the property.  I've lived there 10.5 
years, through 4 different owners.  Wow.

<p><li>Tax Day is coming up!  I'm doing my taxes online at <a 
href="https://www.turbotax.com">www.turbotax.com</a>.  I'm hopefully going 
to get a good refund.

<p><li>Wende has been looking at refrigerators, washers-n-dryers, and 
portable phones to put in our new place..  Thank you Wende!

<p><li>This weekend is Centex, an Ultimate (frisbee) competition on Austin. 
 If I can get a ride, I'll get to go!

<p><li>I've ridden my (borrowed) unicycle all the way to the bank and 2 
blocks less than all the way back to my apartment.  It wasn't in one ride - 
more like one hundred.  But it was great practice.  I was able to go about 
1 block at a time when I finally got balanced and rolling well.

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>I have reviewed 48 CDs for KTRU, many of them this semester!  I like being able to listen and shout in my mind, &ldquo;I reviewed that!!&rdquo;    &ldquo;Review&rdquo; in this context means listen to the CD to see if it&rsquo;s broadcastable by KTRU standards. We rate the songs on a 5 point scale basically and DJs know what&rsquo;s good on the CD before they&rsquo;ve ever heard it or even heard of it. I usually randomly grab CDs I&rsquo;ve never heard and play them when I&rsquo;m there.</li></p>

<p><p><li>A couple nights ago while talking to my dad he was all, &ldquo;if you choose to attend USM, I&rsquo;ll help pay for tuition.  There is a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tuition scholarship available for first year students, so you could have your first year tuition paid.   &hellip;.  if you drop out, you&rsquo;ll owe me the money back.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wow.</p>

<p><p>USM is Univeristy of Santa Monica, where he received his masters in Spiritual Psycology with and emphasis in consciousness, health and healing. I have felt myself pulled in that direction-ish.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I was dating someone until&hellip; Monday night I guess.  Now we are broken up.  It didn&rsquo;t happen in one swoop; she was distant over the weekend, I called her on it, and she said &ldquo;I have
been feeling weird about us lately, like I&rsquo;m not getting what I need from our relationship.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I was basically, &ldquo;okay,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you told me.&rdquo;  When I said, &ldquo;maybe we should just be friends,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;okay&rdquo; as soon as I uttered &ldquo;friends.&rdquo;  Fair enough.</p>

<p><p>Oddly, I felt a sort of positive surge of energy, like I had been pushing my energy toward her to try to draw her to me maybe.  When I recognized it was over, my energy came back and I felt better. Hmm. Nice.</li></p>

<p><p><li>In a subsequent conversation with a friend of mine, I described the afforementioned events and five years of my relationship history. The question came back to me, &ldquo;let me get this straight: you&rsquo;ve been in &lsquo;relationship&rsquo; with someone for essentially all of your adult life?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>That hit me pretty well. &ldquo;Um, yes.&rdquo; How pathetic of me.  For how long have I been saying, &ldquo;I need to just <em>not</em> date anyone for a while.&rdquo; ??  How long does the while last?  A month at most.  Okay, maybe 3.  Not a year.  Maybe I should try a one month at a time committment to myself. That feels right.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I have ordered a new domain. Am I too computer nerdy for my own good?  This will be 3 (technically 4) domains that I own. It should be working in a day or so.  I should have it full of data within a couple weeks.  or more.
</li></p>

<p><p><li>On Tuesday night, I went to KTRU to talk with Dennis (DL on the airwaves) who hosts the Hip Hop show every Tuesday night.</p>

<p><p>Oh oh oh oh and!!!  AND!!!!  I got a ticket to DJ Shadow!  The Music Directors or the Promotions Director or somehow the right people knew that I wanted a ticket and I got a message all, &ldquo;Rob, there is an extra Zap Mama CD; it&rsquo;s in my box if you want it&rdquo; from Michael, one of the music directors. (I reviewed and enjoyed our first copy of it.) I was all, Thanks!!! and went to get the CD this morning and BANG there&rsquo;s a DJ Shadow ticket in my CD case!!!  Too too cool.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I finished my plate that I&rsquo;ve been painting at <a href="https://www.themadpotter.com">The Mad Potter</a>! It&rsquo;s a paint-your-own pottery studio on my street. They provide white pottery and paint. Customers provide creativity and a few dollars and get to take home dishwasher safe, totally useable dish!</p>

<p><p>I had been working on this plate since 16 August. I estimate I put about 37 hours into it.  It&rsquo;s pretty detailed, - not an image <em>per se</em> but swirly twisty weaving ribbons of lines and dots.</p>

<p><p>I also did a plate that sports the logo for FSD Data Services on it. I like my job, and wanted my own FSD plate.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Tonight is DJ Shadow concert at Numbers!  1.25 hours until doors open.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Tomorrow (Friday) begins San Antonio Rally, to which I&rsquo;ll be driving a vanload of youth for 35+ hours of talking, play, music, zany antics, and just about any fun (legal) thing one can think of.</li>
