      <description>19:13 Wednesday 20 February 2019 JST Finally figured out why the sorts were not working on AB; I changed the way GET parameters were cleansed and did not set it to cleanse all 60 required to deal with 20 DataTable columns. Now it works and is on the live site. It is apparently working well, but AB will have some change requests by tomorrow night. We will discuss them on Friday.</description>
