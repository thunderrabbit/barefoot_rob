<li>Yesterday I walked from Shinjuku to Hiroo, from the men&rsquo;s group new
meeting location to our old one.  Last night we met for the last
time at Takeshi&rsquo;s office, and next week we will be in Shinjuku, at
a place I have not yet seen.  I have booked it for all of September
and October, and trust we can get it for longer if we like it.</li>
<li>I did my first workshop last month (Eye Gazing, on August 17th).
We had a great turnout so I am planning to do it again on September
28th.  Yay!</li>
<li>Last night Mark gave me the idea of doing workshops for a living.
It certainly fits my skillset <a href="/journal/2019/09/03/brain-pounding-eyes-vibrating-too-much-computer/">moreso than programming</a>!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 now features CSFERP (Caret Splitter Feeder
Extenstion Reflection Protection), put in place yesterday by
Reversible Guy.</li>
<li>I have not yet gotten into the groove of writing blog entries, but
recently I have put that on my daily ROBOT pages as a 10 point todo
item.</li>
<li>I have been keeping daily ROBOT pages since May, thanks to Hiro for
the idea.</li>
<li>I had my first session with Dean Ramsden.  It was less illuminating
than I guessed/hoped it might be, but I have different sets of
questions for next time.</li>
<li>Lin and I have been doing better over the past month or more,
mostly because I have been chilling tf out and being more
accomodating for communication styles and grammars.</li>
<li>I got AB&rsquo;s DB moved to AWS RDS.  Yay!  Thanks to Travis for
introducing me to Ansible.  Thanks to Ansible for making things
replicable.</li>
<li>I created a Page on FB.
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/barefootrob/">Barefoot Rob</a>.  I
resisted giving in to the borg for a long time, and still want to
keep my content on my server, but they make it so dang easy!</li>
<li>I am ecstatic with the turnout from
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2465227863708851/">my first Eye Gazing workshop</a>;
14 people attended, incluing myself.  I have scheduled a second
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/493730671447073/">Eye Gazing workshop</a>
for Sep 28th, and a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2054284838201319/">Remembering Past Lives</a>
workshop for September 7th.  Looking forward to both!</li>
<li>I have been fascinated with the idea of channeling information
from non-local sources.
<a href="https://www.bashar.org/">Bashar via Darryl Anka</a> is the first
that I paid attention to, and now Abraham via
<a href="https://www.abraham-hicks.com">Esther Hicks</a>.  I wonder about
developing my own channeling skills.</li>
<li>Jennie is still our cat. Lin recently said Jennie is 7 years old.</li>
<li>I still do not have a driver&rsquo;s license in Japan (nor the US, since
my old license expired).  Lin wants me to get one, but I do not
really want to drive in Tokyo.  Especially not have to drive her
&ldquo;big&rdquo; minivan.</li>
<li>I showed up 25 minutes late to my online group today and no one
was there.  It&rsquo;s like my worst dream come true, after I had just
written a page of gratitude to the men of the group for keeping it
going while I am not in attendance.</li>
