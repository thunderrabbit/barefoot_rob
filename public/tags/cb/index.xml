      <description>17:00 Tuesday 08 December 2015 JST Meeting with Satomi was fine as usual. yay! We got her inbox filters fixed so she actually sees emails sent from redmine when I do updates; because those emails were skipping her inbox (and redmine folder/tag) she didn&amp;rsquo;t see when I finished things and so didn&amp;rsquo;t approve them until the next meeting.
Now they can preview things and I removed the unused sharing options (Mixi, Google+, Pinterest) from the (demo) site.</description>

      <description>15:04 Monday 16 November 2015 JST Well the site is up, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as smooth as I had expected. For some reason some of the CSS is borked, though we tested it. bah.</description>
