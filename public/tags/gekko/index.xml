      <description>18:09 Saturday 21 October 2017 JST Good time at Gekko, though a bit expensive overall. 4500 yen for 3 hours of all we can eat; 2 hours for 2&amp;frasl;3 the price would have been better for me.. BUT we got to have grilled bananas with cinamon, so yeah that was pretty good.
Talked to Sebastian, Tim, Mi-chan, Sayori. Sayori got progressively intoxicated and entertaining, though it may have worn out after much longer.</description>
