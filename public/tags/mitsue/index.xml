      <description>21:36 Saturday 08 September 2018 JST I have been taking Soness&amp;rsquo;s Step On The Red Dot course, part of https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/
Today was a normal marathon session of getting stuff done, plus lots of witty anecdotes which I hope are helpful for everyone.
I had to bounce out of the Zoom session after 4.3 hours or so and recorded my second Facebook Live video.

      <description>20:56 Sunday 04 March 2018 JST Went to SOGO for workout with about 50 people in attendance. Great weather and great workout. I met Shell, Koji, Tyler, and others, but cannot remember now.
Went to lunch with Lisa at Laska and chatted with her a bit, and got to see a video of the type of dancing she is doing.
Went down to Tsujido for karaoke after recording video at karaoke with Kai, Mitsue, and Soness as the stars.</description>
