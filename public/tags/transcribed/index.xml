Dug a hole for myself on the beach but it was too far from the waves to bury me in the sand. Headed down to the water a bit more and meditated with Lin. Kept moving down toward the water so I was in the waves from 0 to 40cm deep, avg 2~10cm. たのしかった

Nice time walking around with Paola and Jon after eating in Sendagay at a Japanese restaurant with an American sounding employee who gave us her recommendation for seaweed pizza: nori and mayo basically, but pretty good!
We went to eat ice cream after dinner and there appened to be a MiniStop just down the street so we got Hagen Daaz and then walked toward Harajuku by way of the building where I teach Mutsumis, and the toy store I frequent before those lessons.</description>

      <description>(transcribed from my diary 5:36pm CST Monday 20 January 2003)
(this entry written 29 March 1987)
Hello! This is my new diary. I&#39;ve had this book lying around in my closet for a long time. It&#39;s been waiting for a good use. So now it&#39;s Robert &#34;Ted&#34; (RoberTed) Nugen&#39;s Diary. I&#39;ll need a name for it later. I need to tell about me. No telling who may find this thing. I was born March 25, 1970, in Fort Knox, Kentucky.</description>
