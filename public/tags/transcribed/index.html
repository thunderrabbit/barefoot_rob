<p>Dug a hole for myself on the beach but it was too far from the waves
to bury me in the sand.  Headed down to the water a bit more and
meditated with Lin.  Kept moving down toward the water so I was in the
waves from 0 to 40cm deep, avg 2~10cm.  たのしかった</p>

<p>Got Godot app to highlight clicked items today and got it to highlight
subsequent mouseovered items and unswipe backtracked items.</p>

<p>Right now 8:00 at Lin&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s restaurant calling her sisters and he
wants them to sell products in Japan and oldest sister is like False.</p>

<p>But the best news is for MT3.  Her dad gave me hundreds of ice cream
spoons of a shape I had never seen before.</p>

<p class="note">(transcribed from notepad)</p>

<p>Nice time walking around with Paola and Jon after eating in Sendagay
at a Japanese restaurant with an American sounding employee who gave us
her recommendation for seaweed pizza: nori and mayo basically, but
pretty good!</p>

<p>We went to eat ice cream after dinner and there appened to be a
MiniStop just down the street so we got Hagen Daaz and then walked
toward Harajuku by way of the building where I teach Mutsumis, and the
toy store I frequent before those lessons.</p>

<p>Though the store had closed at 7pm, they were nice enough to do あいさつ with us
at 8pm for a few minutes and the guy was like, &ldquo;Robu!&rdquo; when he saw me
while opening the door to tell Lin they were closed.  He went and got
まいちゃん as well and we said HI etc for a few minutes and then I was
like, &ldquo;well sorry to intrude&rdquo; (お邪魔しました) and they waved bye as
we left.</p>

<p>Then we walked through another shrine thing to bypass most of 竹下通
and hopped on 山の手 line in Harajuku.  There was a cute girl with
face-framing bangs, and lips which reminded me a lot of SBK which is
really interesting cause I just had the dream about her a couple days
ago.</p>

<p>Paola and Jon got off the train in Shibuya so we said bye to them and
I expected the cute girl to get off there as well, but she stayed on
the train even longer than us, so I said <em>see ya never</em> in my head as
we got off in 品川.  We got seats on Tokaido Line (Tokyo Ueno Line)
and I wrote this entry in the notebook I bought to write work notes
after swimming.</p>

<p class=note>(this entry written 29 March 1987)</p>

<p>Hello!  This is my new diary.  I've had this book lying around in
my closet for a long time.  It's been waiting for a good use.  So now
it's Robert "Ted" (RoberTed) Nugen's Diary.  I'll need a name for it
later.  I need to tell about me.  No telling who may find this thing.
I was born March 25, 1970, in Fort Knox, Kentucky.  I lived there in a
trailer for about a year.  Then we moved to Columbia, Missouri.  We
lived there for about 8? years.  Then between 2nd and 3rd grades we
moved to a 2 story house in Spring, Texas.  There were railroad tracks
behind that house.  Then between 7th and 8th grades, we moved to
Tomball, Texas.  I'm still here.  I'll relate stories about the past
in all of those places and vacations I've taken and other stuff later.
I'm debating as to wether I should scatter throughout here as they
come or put them in a separate book.(*) Right now I'm in 11th grade at
Tomball high School.  I'm taking English III with Miss Carter, World
History with Mrs. Roach, Chemistry Honors with Mr. Hamm, Lunch,
Spanish II with Mrs. Sherman, Typing I with Mrs. Benefield, and
Algebra II with Mr Reagh.  They are all good classes.  Spanish and
History are the hardest.  I should be failing Alg. II, but I solved
the "carpet problem" and he is giving me a 90 for the year.  I need to
earn it, because next year I won't have carpet problems to fall back
on.  I'll describe the "carpet prob."  later.  Typing is incredibally
(sp) easy.  I'm averaging about 25 words per minute, and I don't even
have good style.  Next year I'm taking all honors classes except Art
I.</p>

<p>I started this diary for myself, mostly.  I often go on trips and
rallies and come back with lots of memories.  But, I can't get them
all in order, and that bugs me.  Most recently, was my Spring Break
Science Trip.  I have that about halfway in order.  I told a tape
recorder about it.  That is my "rough draft" I think from now on, I
will try to write down the days' events in here each evening.  Each
morning, I will write down my dreams.  For about 3 days, I've been
trying to have lucid dreams.  It may be a phase.  I hope not.  If I'm
on a trip, I don't want to take this with me.  I will have a smaller
note book to record dreams and events.  Even at home I think I will
write down dreams in a smaller book each morning and copy them into
here at night, just before bed.  Well, I guess that's all.  I'll put
guidelines about how to write in here.  Hey!  new idea!  this has page
numbers.

(*) I will scatter things throughout the book as I think of
them.  Anything not written in chronological order will be listed on
the page after this one.  How much should I put in here?  Do I care if
anyone reads it?  I don't know.  I'll think about it.  It would be fun
to write everything so that I may get in trouble if anyone else reads
it.  Well, skip that problem for now.  On to writing.</p>
