      <description>23:30 Sunday 23 June 2019 JST Slept a lot because sick, but I spent some time on getting my site theme figured out.

I thought I had removed Professional and Creative from the homepage, but seems they only got removed from the navigation.</description>

      <description>17:56 Thursday 16 November 2017 JST Mutsumi introduced a new style lesson format where the guides sit down together with me instead of just having individual lessons. Hopefully this will help them improve listening skills by listening to other people have conversations in English.
I showed mt3s.robnugen.com to Miyako and Ayaka. Miyako showed me pics from her trip to the US with Haruka.</description>

      <description>10:52 Wednesday 24 May 2017 JST I just downloaded v0.90 of Blockstack https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-browser/releases/ and sent 0.01 BTC to what is apparently my wallet so I can buy a username.
1 confirmation so far.
11:44 Wednesday 24 May 2017 JST 6 confirmations yay!

Interestingly, I looked up rap.id (not available) and vap.id (available for 0.7BTC). thunderrabbit.id cost 0.008BTC.. (*) so I guess they go by name length (etc) to calculate the price.</description>

      <description>00:34 Sunday 02 October 2016 JST Lin&amp;rsquo;s sleeping with her head on my right arm, so I&amp;rsquo;m typing with my left hand. In Terminator 2, Sarah just said a guy has 215 bones in his body.
Okay, so anyway, several months ago, I wodered how a crowdsourced story might turn out. Can we make something reasonable?
Hmm I better add a public license to it.
The domain name was originally going to be a fake email generator, but now it&amp;rsquo;s a crowdsourced story.</description>
