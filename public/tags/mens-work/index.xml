      <description>05:40 Wednesday 29 August 2018 JST The Mission Workshop was a great success last night, with 8 men in attendance.

What kind of world is it? _________, ___________, ____________.
Then we went back to this ideal world and found ourselves living within it. Not only living, but interacting and behaving in new ways in this ideal world.</description>
