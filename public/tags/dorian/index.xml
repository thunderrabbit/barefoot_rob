      <description>SWUUSI
11pm Tuesday 28 July 1998
transcribed from my diary During Sean&#39;s Hair and Foot Washing Workshop, I got my hair washed by Anna Magwood and Katy Robinson and my feet washed by Josh Voyles. The nurturing attention was wonderful. I was pretty well sunburned today with all my time spent at the lake, even though I started the day with SPF 50. Maybe it wasn&#39;t as waterproof as I hoped.</description>
