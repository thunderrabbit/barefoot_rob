Fucking hell.
Angel, who I knew originally as Red Fern back on the Castle of Dreams (on Fidonet) has apparently committed suicide. Someone on her page wrote something like &amp;ldquo;I cannot forgive you for this; you had so many people to turn to&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;
I have similar sentiments; I know she had some medical debt, and some medical issues, but dang.. could that have warranted a bullet to the head?</description>
