      <description>2 February 1999
My Aunt Mercedes died a few days ago. She had pretty bad and icky cancer all over, so I&amp;rsquo;m glad that she&amp;rsquo;s no longer suffering from that.
She remains a super great loving wonderful memory in my mind. I appreciate all the care she gave to her kids and us.
Today Fred is driving down from Denton to Houston and he and I will drive over to Slidell, Louisiana, a trip we&amp;rsquo;ve taken several times with lots of fun memories.</description>
