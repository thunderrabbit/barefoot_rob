      <description>19:48 Saturday 11 July 2015 JST Redmine Q on superuser took more time to research and write than to just rewrite all the time entries (there are 9), but fuckit; what if I had a million entries? or a quadrillion? (*)
I logged several time entries to an issue in project A, but they should have been logged to an issue in project B.
I tried using Redmine GUI to edit the time entries to be associated with the correct issue, but (because they&amp;rsquo;re in different projects?</description>
