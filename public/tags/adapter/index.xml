      <description>15:43 Friday 20 October 2017 JST I bought an AC adapter to use with my camera. Today I had been able to use the battery for about 90 minutes before it conked out. The adapter was 2000 yen from Amazon, but between 6000 and 8000 yen at Bic Camera and Yodobashi Camera. How will this play out in the long term? Bic Camera connect with Amazon Buy Now inside their store?</description>
