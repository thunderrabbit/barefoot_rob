      <description>21:28 Wednesday 13 February 2019 JST I finally made a dental appointment (with the dentist right under JB&amp;rsquo;s office) after over a year of not going. It&amp;rsquo;s for April 10th; there was no availability that lined up with mine. I will probably go to a dentist near our house sometime in Feb or March.</description>

      <description>15:38 Monday 15 October 2018 JST Dang marbletrack3.com is broken now. Netlify created the SSL cert and neither of my browsers like it.
I will switch back to hosting on Dreamhost if Netlify cannot sort it out.

I have created a support ticket with Netlify.
And to think I was about ready to shift all my static sites over.</description>

      <description>12:11 Wednesday 08 November 2017 JST Rohini just called to see if I am available all day Friday and Saturday&amp;hellip; Oh my goodness I almost am!! All day cycling on Kyushu sounds lovely, especially given that we would be paid for our time!
Virtual I-group meeting is tomorrow and I choose not to cancel it given that I am the organizer.</description>

Actually this happened yesterday; actually I don&amp;rsquo;t know when it happened but I first noticed yesterday. The local installation of AB site isn&amp;rsquo;t responding. git says nothing has changed, but &amp;hellip; something has changed!</description>
