      <description>01:55 Tuesday 01 January 2019 JST 2019 is pretty easy to type because the numbers are right next to each other on both sides of the keyboard.
Lin and I went to her sister&amp;rsquo;s house for new years celebrations. Went to karaoke and then a Chinese izakaya (fusion?) before going to the local shrine where some guys were burning bamboo in metal drums.
We arrived home about an hour before 2019 and took turns taking showers.</description>

      <description>13:27 Monday 08 January 2018 JST Today is the last day of winter holiday for me. Lin and I have been back home for a week, during which I have mostly worked on Godot, read The Power of Now, watched movies with Lin, and worked a bit on MT3.
This past Saturday, we went to see her family for Happy New Year, and I have been chatting with her niece in English on LINE since then.</description>
