<p class=date>8:35am CDT Thursday 22 June 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Before work today, enjoying the early morning sun, I unicycled
outside our house.  I stayed close by the driveway (and phone); I was
waiting for Alisa (Elisa?) to come sleep on our couch between work
ending at 8am and beginning at noon.  (E/Alisa is my dad&rsquo;s
girlfriend&rsquo;s daughter)</p>

<p><p>In order to stay close by the house, I practiced fine tune stuff:
tight turns within the width of the street!  I was able to do them
almost consistently, turning each direction.  I also practiced
starting <em>without</em> having the wheel butted up against a curb.
I started with the wheel parallel to the curb and my right foot on the
right pedal and left foot on the curb.  Then <em>zoink</em> zip my
left foot from the curb to the left pedal and pedal around (or fall
off).</p>

<p><p>Great great fun!</p>

<p><p>A/Elisa arrived once I had decided to rest, I showed her inside,
took a shower, and now I&rsquo;m off to work.  Today is Kevin&rsquo;s birthday and
I get to give him his new plate!</p>

<p><p>Tonight is 1 day away from Summer Solstice!!  For some strange reason, this fact has totally been escaping me&hellip;  I&rsquo;ve been wasting precious daylight!</p>

<p><p>After eating at Mission Burrito with Deborah (sp) and Wende, I rode
my (borrowed) unicycle a total of about 13 blocks!  All the way from
our house to the middle of the American General parking lot (4 blocks
or so), then a few short rides in the parking lot, then several false
starts when leaving the parking lot, but once I got started, I rode 4
blocks along West Dallas (4 lane street) to the Chevron station at the
corner of Montrose and W Dallas (including going up their little
driveway ramp!)  I filled the tire with air, and found it even easier
to ride back home, even over some small bumps and some gravel.  Great
job!</p>

<p><p>Drenched with sweat when I came back in.  I got in the shower and
slowly turned the water from warm water all the way to cold water
only.  Oh so nice to cool off!</p>

<p class=date>6:20pm CDT Friday 19 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I just unicycled around the block!!  I did it in only 2 starts!!
Actually it took 4 starts, but 2 of them resulted in immediately
dismounting (falling off;-).</p>

<p><p>ps: I have noticed that a lot of my journal entries are short, and
I think it would be much nicer for you, my lovely reader, if links to

<p><p>I think it will be relatively simple to add this feature; although
it <em>might</em> slow down the script a little.  (Depends now how well I can
write it.)</p>

<p><p>Wow.  In one hour I unied (past tense of &ldquo;rode my (borrowed)
unicycle&rdquo;) from our house, three blocks to the gas station, put air in
the tire (it was a little flat) and rode almost all the way back.  On
the way back, I found it so much easier!  Note to fellow uniers: keep
your tire inflated!</p>

<p><p>(oh!  At the gas station I saw Meek from Saturday Night Ultimate!
He waved wildly at me, but didn&rsquo;t stop.)</p>

<p><p>Without falling, I rode 2.5 full blocks with full tire, including
turning and avoiding holes, etc.  Super great!  I rode two blocks away
to the nearby restaurant, then back, each direction in one shot. (not
both directions in one shot).  I rode a tiny bit more after reaching
the house again, but find myself just tired (pun intended).</p>

<p><p>I have a slight curved scar on the back of my left calf from the
pedal grinding across my leg when I fell.  Now I have a curved cut on
the back of my right calf.</p>

<p class=date>10:01pm CDT Wednesday 10 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>So I didn&rsquo;t go to ultimate after all.  Got downstairs and
thought&hellip; &ldquo;unicycle&rdquo; because I haven&rsquo;t ridden in a while and my
(borrowed) unicycle is right here in my trunk, while ultimate is way
over there in a field.</p>

<p><p>I did relatively great!  I successfully turned 360 degrees within
the radius of our street (3 cars wide) plus sidewalk (including going
up and back down the slight driveway slope)!  In the intersection of
two 3-lane streets (I&rsquo;m talking 3 lanes total - two for parked cars
and one for traffic in between) I successfully turned 360+ degrees
more than once!  Super cool.  And once just once I felt perfectly
relaxed while riding.  Normally my muscles are all tense and jumpy.  I
think a lot of being able to relax is sitting correctly on the seat
(so that all my weight points straight down through the center of the
wheel).</p>

<p><p>At one point a girl driving by stopped.  &ldquo;That is so coool!!&rdquo;  She
described a guy in Jamaica that could ride a tall unicycle &ldquo;just like
it was his own feet&rdquo; and how she was so impressed by him!  We talked a
bit, and I thanked her for her encouragement!</p>

<p><p>Rode around some more until sweat drenched my shirt, making me too
hot n sticky to wanna ride.  Great job, Rob!</p>

<p class=date>7:44am CDT Friday 28 April 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Last night I pulled out (from my trunk) the old unicycle.  It&rsquo;s
been since my last journal entry that I&rsquo;ve ridden it; I&rsquo;m guessing
over a month, maybe two months ago.</p>

<p><p>Delightfully enough, I have discovered that unicycling is just like
riding a bike; once I&rsquo;ve learned how, I didn&rsquo;t forget.  Granted, I
wasn&rsquo;t great at it, but last night I rode just as well as I had the
last time!</p>

<p><p>After a couple of false starts, I rode the two blocks to my old
apartment (including across the 4 lane street and halfway up the
driveway slope!)!</p>

<p><p>Nancy was outside talking to her plants and cats; we exchanged some
stories of the past couple weeks since I&rsquo;ve seen her.  More cats have
immigrated to the area.  My old apartment is being super-refurbished
and will probably rent for $650 (I was officially paying $435, less
$10 to $60 for doing work around the apartments each month).  They
locked all the windows so I couldn&rsquo;t sneak in to look.</p>

<p><p>I wonder if anyone still has a copy of the key. ;-)</p>

<p><p>Of course, I will come in during the day and ask permission to take
pictures.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday I purchased gas for Scott.  $1.51 per gallon!!  Depending
on where you live, this may seem like nothin&rsquo;, but it&rsquo;s fully 22 cents
higher than it was last week.  Yipes!</p>

<p><p>^^^^^ That&rsquo;s just a side note.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m feeling antsy right now; just like gotta go <em>do</em> something!</p>

<p><p>So I&rsquo;m going to ride my unicycle to the bank.  I got a check in the
mail today for some computer work.  Yay!  I&rsquo;ll let you know how the
unicycling goes.</p>

<p><p>Good luck, me!</p>

<p><p>Wow.  I am officially tired.</p>

<p><p>This was certainly a feat of persistence.  On the way to the bank,
I essentially didn&rsquo;t walk at all.  At each point that I fell (stepped)
off the unicycle, I started from that same point, or at an
easier-to-start point (telephone pole, for example) behind where I
stepped off.</p>

<p><p>I deposited the check at 9:41pm (according to the bank).</p>

<p><p>I got better mps (miles per start) on the way back.  However, by
the time I was about 2 blocks from my house, I just walked the rest of
the way.  My legs are all wobbly-tired, and the sidewalk is quite
uneven.  (I used a side street instead of the sidewalk on the way
there.)</p>

<p><p>So that was it!  I&rsquo;m officially done being antsy tonight.</p>

<p><p>Have a great night!!</p>

<p><p>Ultimate was great fun tonight!  Now I know how some of the guys (John) who play Saturday night have gotten so much better!  On Wednesdays the field is huge and everyone runs!  The structure of play is different, too: instead of playing a game to a certain number of points, we just play one point at a time.  We maintain 7 or 8 people on each team, and as people get tired of play, they swap with people on the sidelines.  That way we don&rsquo;t waste time picking teams between games, and it&rsquo;s a bit nicer to not worry about score.  We just don&rsquo;t keep score at all.</p>

<p><p>On Saturday there&rsquo;s an ultimate tournament, &ldquo;Huckin&rsquo; For Love,&rdquo; sponsored by <a href="https://www.strayconesports.com">www.strayconesports.com</a>.  I just found out about it tonight, and am on the edge of late turning in my registration!  So I shall drive it to the downtown post office tonight and save one mail hop.</p>

<p><p>After ultimate, I somewhat randomly stopped in the large movie theater parking lot and rode my (borrowed from Scott) unicycle!  It had been suggested by Scott that using a shopping cart would be a perfect way to help me learn!  So I found a cart that had been left out for the night and tried his suggestion.  It didn&rsquo;t work worth crap for me.  So I just tried to ride it.</p>

<p><p>The huge flat expansiveness of the parking lot did the trick!  While I had previously been able to uni one block (on not totally flat sidewalk), about 300 feet, this time I was able to uni 112 wheel revolutions, and then a bit later, 145 wheel revolutions!  Lemme do the math - 1 foot radius wheel ~= to 6.2 foot circumfrence, * 112 and 145&hellip; I rode 703 and 911 feet!!!  Super awesome!!!  Those records of mine included some directed gentle turns as well.  Great!!</p>

<p><p>(I didn&rsquo;t do the math above in my head - I used dc, the reverse-polish desk calculator that came with Linux.)</p>

<p class=date>8:46pm CST Thursday 20 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Today I unicycled over 200 feet!  I first started practicing when my brother bought a unicycle around December.  He and I were each able to go about 30 feet, and he could sometimes go 40 feet.  I was so thrilled by my improvement that I borrowed a unicycle and today after practicing less than 2 hours, I went 226 feet!</p>

<p><p>I borrowed it on Tuesday from a guy (Scott) who skates on Tuesday and Thursday nights.  Tonight I made it a goal to uni from my house to where we meet!  I wasn&rsquo;t able to get there in one shot (I even walked part of the way), but by the time I got to the parking lot, I went from one corner to where they were standing on the other side, nearly the entire block!</p>

<p><p>I measured it later to be 32 wheel revolutions, with a wheel 1 foot in diameter, it&rsquo;s like 6.2 * 32 feet!  After they left to skate, I started home and went a distance of 36 wheel revolutions, including down a slight incline!  Aww yeah.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve heard that tonight is full lunar eclipse night!</p>
