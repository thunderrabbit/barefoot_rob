      <description>13:27 Monday 08 January 2018 JST Today is the last day of winter holiday for me. Lin and I have been back home for a week, during which I have mostly worked on Godot, read The Power of Now, watched movies with Lin, and worked a bit on MT3.
This past Saturday, we went to see her family for Happy New Year, and I have been chatting with her niece in English on LINE since then.</description>
