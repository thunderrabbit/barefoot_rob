      <description>20:33 Sunday 10 January 2016 JST Title says it all, but actually I was the only one who ate at 31. I had Vani Vani Vanilla, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as good as Popping Shower.
Taiyaki Hiiragi are the azuki bean filled pastries, &amp;hellip; and they were full.
The ramen shop tasted like ramen to me, but it had come twice recommended to Joanna.
Ouca ice cream was served with salty seaweed, which I thought was gross.</description>

      <description>##22:13 Saturday 27 December 2014 JST##
Lin and I went to Paola&amp;rsquo;s for dinner with some cool peeps including Jas, Rob, Rio, Ryo, and Tomoko. Ryo and Tomoko brought their rabbit, Nana; Rio brought a box of tissues. Rob works with Jon who had to work a bit during the evening.
Food, of course, was amazing, and I tried amaretto for the first time. Pretty yummy!</description>
