      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m headed to Nathan&amp;rsquo;s dentist which is now my dentist.
I like this dentist because he didn&amp;rsquo;t waste time checking my teeth three (3) appointments in a row without doing anything.
First appointment: &amp;ldquo;I recommend you fix this; wanna do it now?&amp;rdquo;
Yes!
16:49 He worked on two teeth, and best I can understand, he filled a filling on the left lower third from back tooth, which also suffers from gum disease (receding gum).</description>

      <description>11:57 Wednesday 09 May 2018 JST Hey Nathan I am making a marble track, a.k.a. rolling ball track, similar to this one I made several years ago, visible here https://mt2.robnugen.com/ This time, however, I am not just making the track, I am also making a stop action animation of some characters making the track. Clips of the video so far are here https://mt3s.robnugen.com in a playlist. (No audio nor background yet; that is a whole other project (I asked you about Blender before)) The project is about 5% finished, and has taken a year to get this far.</description>
