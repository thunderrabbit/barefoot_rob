      <description>01:43 Saturday 07 October 2017 JST 00:43 Saturday 07 October 2017 Perth Super thanks to E for picking me up from the airport and hosting me in his house. I&amp;rsquo;ve got twin beds in my own room. Very cozy!
We ate yogurt, apples, cinammon. I had chia seeds and nuts as well.
Hot tea and now a hot shower for me and bed because we are going to leave in 6.</description>
