<li>Lin and I still have our cat Jennie, still keep her in at night,
still live in Asao-ku near the bottom of a hill.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still working on Marble Track 3, trying to do at least 2 hours
of livestream per week.</li>
<li>I have been working on AB, getting tests added to cover the
important parts of the codebase.  I do not have a lot covered, but
10 tests is an order of magnitude more than 0.</li>
<li>Plus I figured out a way to test AJAX even though I cannot use
Javascript in my tests yet.  (run the AJAX call directly)</li>
<li>I have all my flights purchased for my trip to Vancouver, Houston,
Austin, Hawaii, all focused on MKP, but trying to see some of my
peeps.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, I messed up regarding seeing Colleenie Beanie
<em>again</em> this year.  I said I will sort it out for sure next year
and she said &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;   Fair enough.</li>
<li>I gotta let my Houston and Austin peeps know.</li>
<li>Have written two video briefs to make two MKP videos. One focused
on inviting men to our circle, and one focused on inviting support
for our circle and expanding into Japanese language.</li>
<li>I have recently been in touch with Brian (also in IT), Tony (truck
driver), and Frederick (change agent) via Zoom.  I asked for
support from them when I was beginning to get overwhelmed with all
the tasks across my variety of projects.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3</a> has had its site
updated via Deligence.  I think we had some minor communication

Maybe I should hire some other peeps to work on it more.</li>

<p>(written 10:21 Wednesday 09 May 2018 JST)</p>

<p>I spent a bit over an hour on MT3 yesterday. At least half of that
time was spent thinking about what each character should do next.</p>

<p>I did not finish all my Complice stuff; I think I have overloaded it
with too many tasks each day.</p>

<p>Great Tokyo men&rsquo;s circle last night, despite the rain.  The new man
from last week attended again and had great insights on the problem I
presented to the circle.</p>

<p>I read several pages of Planet on Purpose, which inspired me to be a
more transparent leader in the circle, specifically, admitting when I
wasn&rsquo;t able to complete a task I had set for myself.</p>

<p>Been working on MT3 pretty consistently, and started working on AB
again now that the new verbal agreement has started.</p>

<p>Recently I found
<a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">complice (referral link)</a> which
seems like a pretty good system for organizing my day and stuff.  I
have 19 days in my free test period.</p>

<p>Complice has a slight learning curve, but built-in pomodoros plus a
magic way that when I open a new tab it reminds me what my latest
thing to do is.  Complice connects my tasks with my larger goals, and
allows me to fill in some of the WHY I am doing different tasks, to
help keep me on task.</p>

<p>It is because of complice that I am writing this journal entry now.</p>

<p>Anyway, I stubbed the <del>crap out</del> <ins>skin off</ins> of my
toe yesterday and will wear shoes for a bit.</p>

<p>I wonder how long that image will be available.</p>

<p>Right now I am writing this entry while waiting for the AB server to
finish its backup.</p>

<p>Ah wait a minute.  Another backup started at the same time.  That may
be why they are going slowly.  I will look at them tomorrow.</p>

<p>I could not get Zcash to run on Debian inside virtualbox on Amazon EC2
because they do not support nested virtualization.</p>

<p>I tried just using AWS as the provider and using Vagrant locally, but
I kept getting an error like 「this box is not available on requested
provider」(using Japanese quotes because it is not an actual quote).</p>

<p>So I tried spinning up a Debian box directly on Amazon with Ansible.
It starts and then automatically shuts down.</p>

<p>I have not yet tried starting said box with Amazon&rsquo;s launch wizard.</p>

<p>I cried yesterday during my Japanese lesson.  I could not stand not
knowing the answer because I had not studied.  Basically my teacher was
quizzing me and I kept getting answers wrong because</p>

<ol>
<li>I had not studied</li>
<li>I do not yet know the verbs</li>
<li>I do not yet grok (in)transative in Japanese (though I basically
understand the idea in English)</li>
</ol>

<p>She suggested we switch to just reading some text and skip the grammar
until I have time+desire to study again.</p>

<p>I got a backup script running via cron which saves tables in smaller
bundles than Entire Database at a time.  Basically it saves tables by
searching for a prefix.  Only problem (yes the <em>only</em> problem haha)
with my system is when I do <em>not</em> send a prefix, the script has to
know which prefixes to skip.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all just in his house. I want to get a Japanese-speaking
historian to interview this guy and something something something I
don&rsquo;t know what.  Thing is, I don&rsquo;t know if the guy really wants
publicity.</p>
