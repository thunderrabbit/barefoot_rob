      <description>10:34 Sunday 14 April 2019 JST I am on the way back from Loreatec with another new battery in my computer. I replaced it back in December or so, but it never really acted right. Hopefully this one will do the right things.
Lantz offered this battery at no cost after I tried to pay him. We settled on half price.
10:40 Sunday 14 April 2019 JST Battery has gone from 36 to 31 percent in a few minutes.</description>

      <description>11:20 Monday 14 September 2015 JST Now, to be clear, I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually seen/met Lantz, but the Internoodles assure me he can fix iPhones in a jiffy. I&amp;rsquo;m just starting this optimistic journal entry on the way there because I cannot browse cat pictures on my phone.
12:12 Monday 14 September 2015 JST I&amp;rsquo;ve been here for 12 minutes, and the phone is essentially fixed! He removed the bottom screws and backplate, then swapped the broken thing for a new thing and the phone is charging.</description>
