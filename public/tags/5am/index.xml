      <description>14:25 Monday 15 October 2018 JST On Mondays for the past year or more, I have been waking up at 5am on Mondays to work at IL for an hour from 8am to 9am. Today we talked about the new fish market in Toyosu, and how at 40 hectares, it is 1.7 times larger than the fish market that was in Tsukiji (which I never visited during the fish auctions).</description>

      <description>11:05 Tuesday 14 August 2018 JST I have decided to wake up at 5am each day, and on the five days I do not have to immediately go to work (for which I have already been waking up at 5am), I will go for a brisk walk around the neighborhood.
Today I went up the hill and along the ridge and up left on a street I had never walked before, then up a hill into a park and then omg down a spooky mossy staircase with spiderweb strands hitting my face and cicadas buzzing my ears and mosquitoes chomping my legs.</description>
