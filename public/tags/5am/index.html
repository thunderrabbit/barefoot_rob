<h5 id="14-25-monday-15-october-2018-jst">14:25 Monday 15 October 2018 JST</h5>

<p>On Mondays for the past year or more, I have been waking up at 5am on
Mondays to work at IL for an hour from 8am to 9am.  Today we talked
about the new fish market in Toyosu, and how at 40 hectares, it is 1.7
times larger than the fish market that was in Tsukiji (which I never
visited during the fish auctions).</p>

<p>The days of visiting those fish auctions are over; one of the
bugs/features of Toyosu location is tourists are not allowed in the
same room as the auctions.  I don&rsquo;t really care one way or another,
but I imagine it&rsquo;s somehow better to more easily keep the place
cleaner.</p>

<p>After that lesson I ate two bowls worth of raw salad buffet at .RAW
for 900 yen, and then taught at UG.  Akari, Masa, Eri, Ryuya, Taka,
Shinji, and Kazu were there.  No Kenji today.</p>

<p>I am headed home now because it seems no one else will attend the
<!-- mixed gender --> meeting tonight.</p>

<p>I have decided to wake up at 5am each day, and on the five days I do not
have to immediately go to work (for which I have already been waking
up at 5am), I will go for a brisk walk around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Today I went up the hill and along the ridge and up left on a street I
had never walked before, then up a hill into a park and then omg down
a spooky mossy staircase with spiderweb strands hitting my face and
cicadas buzzing my ears and mosquitoes chomping my legs.   Upon arrival
at the bottom, I turned left onto a little street and met Mr Kasahara
who was like, &ldquo;can I show you?&rdquo; and I was like &ldquo;please!&rdquo; and he showed
me a rainbow colored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysochroa_fulgidissima"><ruby><rb>玉虫</rb><rt>たまむし</rt></ruby>
insect he called a <em>tamamushi</em></a>,
and went on at length about how it was such a rare find.  I was able
to understand about 50% of what he was saying.</p>

<p>The area where he lived used to be named Kasahara, but the Odawara
clan(?) came over and Mr Kasahara had to flee (for his life).  He is
85 years old, and apparently has a fair few stories to tell.  I hope
to see him tomorrow and bring my recorder to record some of his
stories for science and study etc.</p>
