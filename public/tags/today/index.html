<h5 id="16-45-friday-30-august-2019-jst">16:45 Friday 30 August 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Several different things on my day off today.  Mostly related to work,
where I realized the value of having a staging server with non-live
data.  &ldquo;Ohhh that is right; I tested saving data as well..&rdquo; when AB
was like, &ldquo;Um, where is the Azabujuban record?&rdquo; which had been renamed
to &ldquo;Doraemon 5e5433a38e2b035689a75c9ed11ffb0e&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once I fixed all of those (about 8 different records) based on the old
live DB which is still available at cli with <code>mysql</code> as root, I
watched episode 3 of The Naked Director.</p>

<p>This show is somewhat a comedy, but fills in my imagination of the
heady days before the bubble burst here in Japan.  I sometimes wonder
what it could have been like then, and this gives me a sense that I
would not have necessarily been better off for being here then.
Interesting to watch, though, and practice listening to Japanese.</p>

<p>I tried to do some more work, but was leaning toward porn after having
watched a shows which leans toward porn, so I took a nap.</p>

<p>Woke up and wrote down <a href="/journal/2019/08/30/dream-unstoppable-trains/">a dream about unstoppable trains</a>.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/20190830_165150_Dream_0000000249.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/thumbs/20190830_165150_Dream_0000000249.jpg" alt="20190830 165150 Dream 0000000249" /></a></p>

<p>And as I write this, I see the messy image and realize if I ever clean
up those images, I hope I either create redirects or think to fix the
links here.</p>

<p>Mohamed asked the URL for my journal, which is nice timing because
today is the first day for me to use ROBOT pages from August 29th,
which include writing a journal entry by default.  Again, this
directory and file structure leaves a lot to be
desired. <a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/2019/">https://b.robnugen.com/robot/2019/</a></p>

<p>I want to have OCR determine the dates of the pages and rename the
files based on those dates.  I have considered posting each page in
this journal stream, but I think it would be better to make an RSS
feed of them (but it would not get updated with each scan (if it was
tied only into this repo of entries)).  It should be a different RSS
feed, built just for b.robnugen.com</p>

<p>Nice meditation this morning and just finished an online group meeting
for Integration Group Coordinators.  It went well, though some
&ldquo;summaries&rdquo; from small groups seemed like they may be as long as the
originals.</p>

<p>I wanna do some work for AB, ConSwi, TEDx, and meditation.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m headed to Hiroo for two (2) workshops.  One, for men
already in the group, a Mission workshop to find or refine our life
missions.  <em>Why are we here in this world, on this planet?  What value
do we bring to the world?  How?</em></p>

<p>The next workshop is for new men, an introduction to our work.  I
think a couple men will attend even though I am the only person who
has responded on Meetup for our second
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/events/260931056/">Journey of the Heart</a>
workshop.</p>

<p>I chalk it up to only having it online for about 10 days with minimal
promotion.</p>

<h5 id="18-11-monday-06-may-2019-jst">18:11 Monday 06 May 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Great workshops today.  Good feedback from the men on both of them.
Great work by men who participated.</p>

<p>Six men in attendance, counting me and Robert Golden who has attended
as a guest facilitator.</p>

<p>I feel physically tired.  Emotionally I feel grounded joy.</p>

<p>Today has seemed busy; my brain was spinning with what to do next for
a while this morning.  I ended up creating a new Part entry for Marble
Track 3 (tssfobls) before attending men&rsquo;s group meeting (Integration
Group Council).</p>

<p>Now I am on the way back from Tokyo station where I met Tariq and Jon
(for different reasons).  Tariq about ConSwi, and Jon to give him a
bag he left at our house.</p>

<p>I will hopefully be in time at home to attend Japanese lesson with
Mana at 3pm.  ギリギリかな。</p>

<h5 id="14-17-friday-26-april-2019-jst">14:17 Friday 26 April 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Noborito station is next.  Looks like I will be home just in time.</p>

<h5 id="20-42-wednesday-09-january-2019-jst">20:42 Wednesday 09 January 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Today was a long day, starting with recording a first draft of a video
for my first GoFundMe campaign, then two TY lessons, two MKP meetings,
lunch with Tomoko, then an hour chillin with &ldquo;a flower in each hand&rdquo;
behind the desk of the Sweets Party Attendants, having a non-lesson
with them because they have nothing going on.</p>

<p>During this non-lesson, Tomoko showed me her &ldquo;personal こたつ&rdquo; which
consisted of a heater under her desk and a blanket strategically
arranged to drape down over her legs.  I showed them the latest MT3
video clip,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&amp;video_id=OHCg01--Zsc">cut and glued 7th outer spiral support</a>.
M&rsquo;s comment was (something like) 「思ったより短い」(but she translated
it as &ldquo;not as much progress as I expected&rdquo;, so I know my adjective is
wrong in Japanese).  Tomoko said she would work on translating more of
the website.  I knew I was stretching it to invite her to (create a
Github account, learn git and) do pull requests (but I tried anyway,)
and when she saw the source code of a page she commented 「難しい！」
so I apologized and thanked her for anything she could do.</p>

<p>Then headed to JB where we practiced &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; with kids
lessons and played a variant of UNO targeting adjectives, animal
names, body parts, and a
couple semantic rules:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see a red nose; I play a red dog&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with the adults in my 8pm class things like &ldquo;I see a reindeer
with brown antlers; I play a tiger standing in front of brown trees&rdquo;
and culminating with Hide&rsquo;s &ldquo;I see an elephant standing on yellow sand
and wearing a yellow ribbon; I play an elephant standing on yellow
sand and wearing a yellow ribbon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with the adults in my 9pm class all calling in absent, I got to
head home early.  I am one station from Noborito now when the class
would just be finishing.</p>

<h5 id="21-56-wednesday-09-january-2019-jst">21:56 Wednesday 09 January 2019 JST</h5>

<p>And now I would be just a station or two from Noborito, but Lin and I
are home.  yay!</p>

<p>Slept late until 8 am after getting home late after long day
yesterday.</p>

<p>Worked on Marble Track 3, where I have just linked to the main scene
the scene which explains the chopstick falling from the heavens.</p>

<p>Great MKP men&rsquo;s group today; I got to figure out (at least one of the
reasons) why I was upset about people not doing what they say they
would do.  I let out some anger onto my old backpack, turning it
inside out in the process.</p>

<p>Headed to work now at SCC for lesson with Liliko and others (not yet
sure who), then off to Akihabara for GG lesson with Mayumi and them.</p>

<h5 id="17-55-thursday-20-september-2018-jst">17:55 Thursday 20 September 2018 JST</h5>

<p>Hitomi donated her 0.5 hour to Liliko, so 1.5 hour lesson with Liliko and
0.5 hour lesson with Miyako.</p>

<p>Now I am in Akihabara across the street from GG lesson.  It&rsquo;s raining
gently, but my rolly bag seems okay.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about my morning routine.  Today I came upon a
grand idea to exercise each morning by walking around my local area
for perhaps 20 or 30 minutes on days that I do not have to leave at
5:45 in the morning.</p>

<p>Lin walked with me today, and we saw some interesting old (and not as
interesting new) houses in our neighborhood on streets I had never
previously used.  This could be a fun healthy adventure!</p>

<p>Had a quick meeting with Tariq this morning about
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi">ConSwi</a>.  At this point
there are 2
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues">open issues</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/2">#2</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/6">#6</a>) and Tariq will
adjust the size of the image which shows players to swipe pieces.</p>

<p>After writing this entry, I will go to SOGO for weekly workout and
after that join Lin at Chazu&rsquo;s house in town.</p>

<p>I contacted the organizer of TEDx Roppongi, which is scheduled for
November 3rd of this year.  I&rsquo;m not sure if I will end up helping with
that, but I&rsquo;m interested, because eventually I would like to speak on
stage at a TEDx event.</p>

<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m preparing for a workshop to be held on November
23rd, which will be an introduction to the men&rsquo;s group work that we
do.  We plan to allow only 12 new attendees to attend that workshop.</p>

<p>We have a typhoon coming apparently.  As always with typhoons in
Tokyo, I&rsquo;m not too worried.  The storms end up being less impressive
than a normal spring storm in Houston.</p>

<p>Mixed-gender group was cancelled today for the second week in a row
due to lack of attendance.  boo.</p>

<p>One of my new students paid me Friday yay.</p>
