<p>On Wednesdays, I wake up at 5am and leave the house at 5:45am so I can
get on a train that arrives in Noborito at 6:29am but leaves Noborito
at 6:57am.  That gives 58 minutes of sleeping time on the train
including both waiting and riding to Kawasaki.</p>

<p>Then lesson in Solid Square with Ayano, Takato, Yohei, Ai, and I
talking about reasons we (dis)like certain months or seasons.  A bit
challenging lesson because the students are at such different levels.</p>

<p>Then chatted for a long time with Christian at
<a href="https://www.japanese.io/">Japanese IO</a> about their upcoming features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sharing</li>
<li>Listening</li>
<li>Automagic SRS</li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully the site will support many people in learning Japanese.</p>

<p>Lunch with Tomoko at SCC and then briefly said HI to Liliko and Hitomi
(who work together) there before lesson with Midori (who works with
Tomoko).</p>

<p>Then to JB for two lessons with elementary school students, and two
lessons with adults from age 24 (or so) to 50 (or so).  These again
were challenging due to different levels.  I&rsquo;m kinda glad Misato could
not make it today.</p>

<p>Walked to the station with Chihomi(?) and Kaori.  Chihomi had just run
a half marathon this past weekend, and asked us abut our marathon
histories.  Mine is zilch, and I was surprised to hear Kaori
had/sometimes(?) runs 5km around Imperial Palace in central Tokyo.  8
times around for a full marathon.  haha yeah I ain&rsquo;t doing that!</p>

<p>Train and then rode home with Lin who usually picks me up at the
station on Wednesday nights.  She had just gone to see
<a href="https://www.amma-rainichi.org/english/">Amma</a> (and Paola, who is
likely to leave Japan for a while) with our neighbor Mai.</p>

<p>Egad I got my credit card bill (yay I have a credit card) and holy
shipes I should have been a bit more careful.  Gotta sort out $450 by
the tenth.  I would think I should have this shit figured out by now.</p>

<p>In other news, Lin and I walked into one of the unfinished homes near
our house.  Did not stay too long and did not go to the second floor
because there were no stairs installed yet.</p>

<p>Oh, and I went to SOGO this morning.  Raisu was back, now living in
Japan so will attend more often.  Kay had to bounce early and Thanuja
was not there at all, but Oliver came!  Yay!  Had not seen him in over
a year.</p>

<p>Oh, and I spent a good bit of time working on ConSwi.</p>

<p>oops it is tomorrow already, but today Lin and I had neighbors Richard
and Mai over for lunch, and then went for a walk with them and Fitz.
We found a geocache.</p>

<p><a href="https://coord.info/GLVJHGHK">https://coord.info/GLVJHGHK</a></p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/2018_april_second_geocache.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/thumbs/2018_april_second_geocache.jpg" alt="2018 april second geocache" /></a></p>

<p>I got a sharp flake of plastic splintered into my foot on the way
home.  Thankfully Lin was able to get it out relatively easily.</p>

<p>Today was the last day for
<a href="https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/">Build Your Speaker Bio</a> course;
I will miss everyone and am really thankful for how much Soness helped
with my speaker sheet.</p>

<p>No one attended co-gender group (besides me) today.  I read several
pages of <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Planet-Purpose-Prosperity-Authentic-Leadership-ebook/dp/B07BNRS5LC/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2609328962?_encoding=UTF8&amp;%2AVersion%2A=1&amp;%2Aentries%2A=0&amp;ie=UTF8"><em>Planet on Purpose</em></a> by Brandon Peele.  Quite a good book for me.</p>

<p>Yesterday I studied during co-gender group; no one else came.</p>

<p>Today I broadcast for two hours on Youtube for Marble Track 3.</p>

<p>Today before the men&rsquo;s group, I met Rohini in Hiroo at Aloha Today
restaurant.  Told her about my experiences in Portland.  She bought me
dinner (yay + yum) and then I went to men&rsquo;s circle.  4 men (including
myself) attended the men&rsquo;s group.</p>

<p>Kinda lazy day, but now am finally caught up after trip last weekend.
Did not get as much done with Complice items as I wanted, but still
got more done than I think I would have without having Complice as a
reminder, or without my accountability partner on the site.</p>

<p>I watched the most recent two episodes of かケグルイ(sp) and had a
Japanese lesson with Fumiko.  She gave me some homework so I wonder if
I will do it.</p>

<p>Talked to Mikako today about kanji for my name; I had wanted to get a
hanko made with my inkan, but turns out it&rsquo;s not easy to get an
officially recognized kanji for my name spelled with western
characters.  Might just give up on the idea, but I still need some
kind of hanko, so I will get something.</p>

<p>After my morning lesson I had a big gap during which I had a big nap
because dang I was tired.  I seem to have gotten over the <em>jet lag</em>
(new vocabulary word for some students today).  I was roused by a
security guard when I tried to nap on a grassy field on 3F of Lazona
(next to Eggs N Things (or something)).  But before he roused me, I
got to sleep there about an hour or so, so that was nice.</p>

<p>They are putting a new green fake grass surface in Lazona, to give it
a (fake) park-like atmosphere.  It looks nice; I wonder how functional
it will be.</p>

<p>Headed to JB at 3:30 and just finished a bit ago.  7pm lesson featured
a discussion of WTC7, and 8pm lesson featured intonation practice.
How are you?  How are <em>you</em>?</p>

<p>Today I spent the morning setting up a test image upload page to see why I can&rsquo;t get the main page to work via https.</p>

<p>Frustrating: the test page is working fine.</p>

<p>Working, I  was distracted from online integration group, and then zoned to SCC and found out the manager is leaving soon.</p>

<p>Now in Akihabara about to go to GG lesson.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a> I added 22 Intentions
for today ranging from online courses to programming, to fixing the
ugg boot which Bryn bought me back in the day. Also, gotta leave at
10:30am to TY today, which is two hours from now, so I am tempted to
work on MT3 in this time.</p>
