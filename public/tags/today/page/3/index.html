<p>Funny talking to Scotty on Marco Polo; he kept not being able to hear
me until I was like &ldquo;okay bye&rdquo; or &ldquo;okay I hope you could hear it that
time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am headed to Kawasaki to support the guides in the English versions
of their work.  Then GG lesson in Akihabara.</p>

<p>Quick online I-group today; everyone checked out so it was just me and
my coach near North Zulch, Texas.</p>

<p>Bleary eyed wake up with <a href="https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Items:Noisy">Noisy</a> at 5:30am.</p>

<p>Was genki and dancing around by 6am to wake up Lin.</p>

<p>cold cold walk to station and caught 6:?? train then in Kawasaki by
7:30 for my 7:50 lesson.</p>

<p>Online I-group after the lesson featured lots of disconnects by the
free wifi provided by Wired Cafe.  But free, for the price of lunch.</p>

<p>Bought a trackball mouse afterward.  It works fine, though I do not
have a name for it yet.</p>

<p>Had a snooze on the train to Akihabara, and am now here at conveni
across the street from my lesson at 6:30pm.</p>

<p>Oh, on the way here I messaged a man who lives in Tokyo.  He said he&rsquo;d
be interested in our local I-group.  yay!</p>

<p>I plan to work for a bit to create an English version of a website and
then head out to SOGO.  The weather looks stunningly good.</p>

<p>The weather was great.  Workout was great.  Some of the organizers
were hung over, and others were hung over enough to not attend.</p>

<p>Eric invited people to Crayon House (vegan buffet) to which I had been
once before; it was great this time as well.</p>

<p>Sat with Tanuja, who&rsquo;s been in Japan one year longer than I, and
Masako, who&rsquo;s been in Japan longer than both of us put together.</p>

<p>Great lesson this morning; we estimated the viability of a product
based on its description.  This process provided a review of vocab
from last time so I think it was really useful.</p>

<p>Worked at work and updated Ghost Inspector tests to deal with new
version of Datatables.  Moving to version 1.10 of datatables I needed
to change Ghost Inspector to find the search field as type=&ldquo;search&rdquo;
instead of type=&ldquo;text&rdquo;. I guess type=&ldquo;search&rdquo; is an HTML5 thing.</p>

<p>Great I-group tonight; I led an exercise that encouraged some &ldquo;deeper
sharing&rdquo; as we would say in YRUU parlance.  Good stuff, and I got some
stuff out and good insights in return.</p>

<p>Watched construction in Shibuya for several minutes after the
meeting.  They had some large containers full of soil which they moved
with a giant crane so a little backhoe could scoop the soil out of the
containers and put it in dump trucks.  It required about 20 scoops to
fill the dump truck, and at least two dump trucks to hold everything
in the container.  Why not just put the container on the back of a
bigger truck?</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m in Shinjuku on Odakyu Line, and train is about to leave
(21:47pm, according to my computer)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m planning to buy some <a href="https://getmonero.org/">Monero</a>, now that
it&rsquo;s gotten a bit popular and just came across my radar.</p>

<p>Today I sent Gary <a href="https://art.robnugen.com/sv15">Summer Vacation</a>, and
I sent <a href="https://art.robnugen.com/ts">Three Straps</a> to Scout Seven.</p>

<p>I logged on to streamen (NSFW) to broadcast my feet today.  Today was
the first time I chatted with anyone on the site!  One person seemed
to really like my feet, but didn&rsquo;t send any tips.  But it was enough
to encourage me to keep trying.</p>

<p>Today I worked on getting Hugo to do some things I&rsquo;d like it to do.  I
created a crappy theme and used pagination functions which spewed out
300 pages worth of entries.</p>

<p>Need to get prev/next working before I&rsquo;ll actually have it a bit
further than Middleman, but wooodoggie Hugo sure is faster than
Middleman!</p>

<p>Worked on pong a bit.  Now the AI is a bit more random about what ball
it chases, but it&rsquo;s definitely not smart about it!  Play
<a href="/samples/unity3d/pong/16-pong-to-50-points/">pong to 50 points</a>.</p>

<p>I signed up for <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> so I can study
and keep my progress synced across devices!!</p>

<p>Oh, and I put some of our homemade yogurt into a towel, hung it in the
fridge, and hope it will make cheese.  Let&rsquo;s see.</p>

<p>Oh, and I made a maze for Katerina.</p>

<ul>
<li>-</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh the one big thing I can&rsquo;t do yet is type Japanese on the Debian
box.  I looked a the docs a bit and was like, ummmm..</p>

<p>Hopefully tomorrow I&rsquo;ll use the new old Dell Debian box to make an
edit to AB website.  T added a ticket today, and hopefully it will be
an easy fix.</p>
