      <description>10:22 Friday 26 July 2019 JST Nice meditation this morning and just finished an online group meeting for Integration Group Coordinators. It went well, though some &amp;ldquo;summaries&amp;rdquo; from small groups seemed like they may be as long as the originals.
I wanna do some work for AB, ConSwi, TEDx, and meditation.</description>

      <description>Late late Friday Dec 27, 1991
(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)
I&amp;rsquo;m mostly caught up on the house &amp;amp; the budget. I forgot to log one check of mine, so that&amp;rsquo;s on hold for a while (until my next statement)
Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m going to play racquetball with Mr Bandecca. That will be cool. Later. Love Rob</description>
