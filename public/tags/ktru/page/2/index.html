                        <p class=date>2pm 29 December 1999</p>

<p>KTRU was great fun today!  I recorded my show (recorded 2 hours of my 3
hour show) for Channing, a youth in Tulsa, who was really excited to
expand his musical awareness!  I think Side A is more musically
expanding&hellip;</p>

<p>But!!  The coolest thing:  A guy called in; &ldquo;Will you play something by
Squarepusher?&rdquo;  (I gave my standard non-committal answer; I didn&rsquo;t know
if I could find it).</p>

<p>I followed my guess to some hip hop LPs and saw Latyrx on one of the
sleeves.  &ldquo;Latyrx!  I saw them at the DJ Shadow concert!&rdquo;  Pulled it
out, and found misfiled in that sleeve, Squarepusher.  For real!  And
that was like 20 seconds after I hung up the phone with the guy who
requested it!</p>

<p>I cued it, played it, got a phone call from the same guy.  &ldquo;Thanks,
bro.  But you&rsquo;re playing it at the wrong speed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DOH!  Sure enough, a large &ldquo;45&rdquo; was slowing spinning around at 33 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>
rpm.  &ldquo;Shall I change it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;nah; I&rsquo;ve never heard it at this speed before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I let the song complete its slow play, then relayed the funny rotation
speed story over the air and played a portion of it at the correct
speed.  &ldquo;So imagine what you just heard being played at this speed and
there you go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faded the song out, &ldquo;And here is Sonic Youth as Ciccone Youth playing
&lsquo;HI Everybody&rsquo;&rdquo; and doh!! I played it at the wrong speed!!!  Aaauhh!! I
fixed this one in within the first 10 seconds..</p>

<p>With Love
- Rob</p>

                        <p>I was on KTRU today &ldquo;helping&rdquo; Alexis interview a guy named Philip
Gayle.  At first I was anti-impressed with the interview; it seemed
trite and unprepared.  But that sponteneity really became great fun!  So
I went out there to see them.</p>

<p>I say &ldquo;helping&rdquo; because I was an unplanned uninvited guest.  But Alexis
was happy to have me join.</p>

<p>Philip Gayle is just a solo artist.  He had 2 little mandolins and would
make up songs:
&ldquo;I call this one &lsquo;I have too much sugar in my chloaca&rsquo;&rdquo;  and just scribble
and scratch the strings, for a full five minutes, including licking his
fingers and rubbing/squeaking the wooden surface of the mandolin&hellip;
crazy!</p>

<p>Alexis is fun; she helped train me as a DJ when I first started working
at KTRU, and now I randomly call her or say HI at her show.  She never
comes to see me&hellip; hmmm.</p>

<p><p>KTRU was great fun today!  I didn&rsquo;t have a theme, but had a few
excellent segues.  One was priceless!  I was playing the Sounds of North
American Frogs CD, which consists of hundreds of tracks.  Most of them
are about 17 seconds long (a few are longer) and of the following
format:</p>

<pre>
This frog, the blahblahbinous blahvine, has a trill twitter sound much
like its cousin, the bluhvine bloovious.   

[Trrriiillllllllll]   [Trrrriiillllllll]    [Trrriiillllllllll]  
[Trrrriiillllllll]    [Trrriiillllllllll]   [Trrrriiillllllll]   
[Trrriiillllllllll]   [Trrrriiillllllll]    
</pre>

<p><p>The spoken part is a very dry humorless voice.  I played about 7
tracks and then just as he was done speaking, I cut off the frog CD and
started a throat singing of India CD, and it sounded so perfect!</p>

<p><p>Anyone listening closely should have gotten a good chuckle.</p>

<p><p>Wende and I are going to work on the mountain fountain!!</p>

                        <p class=note>(transcribed from my diary) [except for text in brackets]</p>

<p class=date>29-31 october 1999</p>

<p><p>5:31am Saturday 30 October 1999</p>

<p><p>Oh my god it&rsquo;s 5:21 am.  I&rsquo;m at San Antonio Rally.  After work I
was all &ldquo;Ohshit! I didn&rsquo;t get the van!&rdquo;
[it would be a very unfortunate situation to have 12 youth ready to go to San Antonio and me have to say, &ldquo;um, I forgot to pick up the van from the rental place.&rdquo;]
Called the place and they were still open until 6pm.  It was 4:45.  I
went and got it no problem.  All the arrangements had been made by
Rog, and it was beautifully easy for me.</p>

<p><p>Drove back to work to get my CDs because there&rsquo;s a CD player in the rental van!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Then to KTRU to spin Side 1 of &ldquo;The Bear That Wasn&rsquo;t&rdquo; on Jonathan
and Sabrina&rsquo;s show. I got permission from the music director to spin
one side per week!
[there are eight sides on 4 disks in this story-album] Jonathan and
Sabrina gave me phat props on the air afterward. Nice!</p>

<p>((Feb 2015: if I remember correctly, the record was a 45 rpm disk, but
the turntables didn&rsquo;t support that speed, so to make it sound natural,
I spun the record by hand at the right speed.))</p>

<p><p>Home and packed for the rally, shaved my head, shaved my faced,
fixed spelling of Mondro&rsquo;s name on my dj_shadow.html entry and then
drove to church, picked up youth and drove to San Antonio.</p>

<p><p>[We left around 8:25pm and stopped by the bus station in downtown to
pick up Nathan and Ashley. Left the city around 8:50pm. On the way
there, we stopped once for gas (had used a quarter tank) and munchies.
Mostly just listened to music all the way.]</p>

<p><p>Arrived around 12:30am and play play play (re)learning more names:
Zara, Dara, Joanna, Hillary, Patrick, Travis, JoJo, Sam, Karen, Adam,
Oliver.. [if I left someone out that means I forgot you or I for sure know your name!]</p>

<p><p>I just realize for the second time that I don&rsquo;t need a huge
DSL-enabled unix laptop to be able to write these entries! Any laptop
with floppy would be great!</p>

<p><p>Talking to Austin - funny stuff: a pogo stick with a hugenormous
spring that would let us bounce hundreds of feet into the air..</p>

<p><p>Maia came up, &ldquo;hey Rob, where&rsquo;s the other half of your brain?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What????&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fricke.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aw man.. Jason had to work. Doh.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>3+ am Sunday 31 Oct 1999</p>

<p><p>YAC meeting was great today.  Joined by Mark Westerburg (sp) who
had super insightful comments and suggestions - great fantastic to
have his input.</p>

<p><p>We got a pretty big lot accomplished - my portion is to help with
website - help Zara update it.</p>

<p><p>Highlights of the day [not at YAC meeting] as I remember them:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Austin and I laffing our asses off practicing our "what's up?" 'skit' thing.  Hardly a skit - a long series of choreographed "gimme five" hand slaps while we kept saying "what's up??" with increasing vigor.  You had to be there.  [We ended up not doing the skit at the talent show because it had no conclusion - nothing really funny about it unless it's spontaneous.]

<p><li>Bryn teaching an American Sign Language workshop.  She taught us stuff like: the letters of the alphabet, man, woman, boy, girl, where, what, why, who, how, my name is ____, how are you?, today, tonight, born, stars, persecute, teach, learn, together, sex, oral sex, lesbian, gay.

<p><li>Talking to Lauren's mom Andrea - and getting big kudos for being ROB that they all love so much.

<p><li>Me and Ashley paired up at worship outside in the freezing cold and having kT come up with her blanket and covered all 3 of us with it.

<p><li>YAC wrote a smoking consequences policy!  Presented it to YRUU and the new bylaws are passed!!!  Yay!! We've been working on this for so long - 3 years I guess.  "No smoking" policy is strong.  It includes 3rd offense = 6 months of no YAC sanctioned events.

<p><li>The funniest thing in the world: 

<p>[pretend you attended Bryn's American Sign Language workshop. Pretend that Ian (tall guy) has walked up with Patrick behind him and Patrick's arms are pointing forward pretending to be Ian's arms. A blanket covers Patrick and Ian's actual arms.]

<p>Austin and I were laughing so hard that our throats were hurting. oh my god this was so funny.  Patrick is signing as Ian translates as if Ian is talking and signing: "lesbian, sex, lesbian, sex, big, lesbian, sex, lesbian, sex" 

<p>[This is just so unfunny compared to the moment.  I told Austin, "this is one of those moments that cannot be captured without a video camera.."]

</ul>

<p><p>Woke up naturally this morning and just found out we gained one hour of sleep!!  yay!!</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>11:07pm Monday 1 November 1999</p>

<p><p>On the way home kT and I laughed for 20 minutes at an exit sign for Chew Rd.  She took a picture.</p>

<p><p>Drove pretty super fast 80-90mph and got David to his drop off point on the edge of Houston actually 30 minutes early.  We did not stop until we arrived there.  I&rsquo;m thankful for no cops or tickets!</p>

<p><p>Waited until 12:30pm when his parents should have been there and left him at 12:38. I felt a bit nervous to leave him there, but I knew he would be okay. We also had to get Ashley to the bus station at 1pm.</p>

<p><p>Fast again and got her to the station a few minutes early.  She was all, &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed with your timing.&rdquo;  Me too.</p>

<p><p>Dropped off youth at church and went home to shower before Molly&rsquo;s Halloween party!</p>

<p><p>I came in to work today for the speedy internet connection, and so I could review CDs while I&rsquo;m online.  At home, I use linux to be online, but I haven&rsquo;t set it up to be able to listen to CDs.</p>

<p><p>Today I reviewed <i>pro audio</i> by neil landstrumm, and <i>a ma zone</i> by zap mama.</p>

<p><p>Neil CD was techno-esque with mostly two step (boom tik boom tik boom tik sound) and lots of layers of electronics on that.</p>

<p><p>Zap Mama features beautiful melodious female vocals with a grand variety of instruments backing them up.  The sounds ranged from jazz, to hip hop, to tribal, to funk, to reggae.  Lots of great stuff.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Last night I went to a party with a friend of mine (I&rsquo;m going to keep this entirely anonymous).  A friend of my friend called the party, with an odd question/concern: had his fiance&rsquo; and a mutual friend showed up at the party?</p>

<p><p>He was at a payphone, slightly intoxicated (he had mostly sobered up after being on the phone with our party for an hour), and had been left there essentially, by his fiance&rsquo; and a friend of his and another friend, because he didn&rsquo;t want to go with them, but wanted to stay home and study.  They refused to take him home, his fiance&rsquo; refused to give him even his house keys&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know the whole story, but he was worried/angry about them, they were no where to be found, and it was just so melodramatic!</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t even really have a point, but it just seemed so odd to me that people would act like that.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>I called Card A today and I have a balance of $5603.22 on it!  Yay!  This is good because it means the balance is being carried at 4.9%, instead of 18 or 13 percent on the other cards.  The 4.9% interest rate is good for 6 months from now, so I will have to move it again in April.</p>

                        <p class=date>7 october 1999</p>

<p><p>Today it was decidedly cold when I woke up!  I&rsquo;ve been sleepin&rsquo; with only a sheet for the past some weeks, and my bedroom window is open so Spot can get in and out via his tree.  But this morning I woke up and brrrr!  It was like 60 degrees!  I couldn&rsquo;t find my comforter in my sleepy state, so I grabbed my sleeping bag and recuddled myself up for a bit.</p>

<p><p>It was about 6:30 am.</p>

<p><p>Oh wait.  Today I was going to do laundry.  So I got up, took a soothing hot shower and collected my ton of dirty clothes, and headed off to the laundry mat.</p>

<p><p>I listened to the Ben and Sarah show on KTRU while waiting for my laundry to complete. They&rsquo;re fun.</p>

<p><p>Finished laundry (that was quick!) and went straight to work.</p>

<p><p>Here at work I&rsquo;ve been reading about DSL and getting some good basic knowledge about how to decide what options to choose and good stuff like that.  But, I even got to show off my smart html / web brain on a question my boss had.</p>

<p><p>He wanted to block all but only certain IP addresses to a set of files.  I figured out how to do it blocking a single IP address, but when it came to blocking a set of addresses, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how Network ID and Subnet Masking came into play.  Hmm.  So I called super smart Marcel and he was able to get me straightened out enough to get it.</p>

<p><p>I got it.</p>

<p><p>Good thing too because tomorrow at 8am we&rsquo;re going to implement the changes!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m splitting now; will pay bills and stuff then go skating at 8pm!  See ya!</p>

<p>This morning before KTRU, I purchased a cassette tape to record
my show for Zara, who requested a Rob Mix tape.  When she asked
me for such a tape, I was all, &ldquo;when will I ever have time to
make a mix tape???&rdquo;  Oh yeah..  I can just record my show at
KTRU!  So that is what I did.</p>

<p>However, at KTRU I was not able to get the station turned on.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s off when I get there in the mornings this semester, but a
quick phone call with the secret code will turn it on. Not this
time.  So I paged the station General Manager, and called the
Station Manager.  Station Manager suggested something to try.
General Manager called me back and suggested a solution, but
after I tried the first suggestion, the station came on.   Yay!</p>

<p>Good thing I was recording the whole event, and entertainingly, I
recorded my end of the last two phone conversations at the
beginning of the tape!  Great!!!</p>

<p>We had a whole stack of passes for two to Happy Texas, a movie
about some escaped convicts posing as beauty pageant experts.</p>

<p>I announced them on the air and I gave away two and grabbed a
pass for myself.  Amanda and I went to see it and thought the
movie was pretty funny!   I even cried at the very end, although
I believe the scene was not designed to be tear jerking. Oh well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Also today, I reviewed a 2 CD set by Momus, called Stars Forever,
which I really enjoyed!!  I turned in milk bottles at the grocery
store to get the deposits back (dollar each for seven bottles)
and then purchased printer ink cartridge for my printer so I
could print the CD review.</p>

<p>Turned in the CD and said HI to the DJs there and asked Holly if
she knew of a PJ Harvey song that had chorus, &ldquo;is that all there
is?&rdquo;  because the owner of Mission Burritos asked and I think
she&rsquo;ll give me free burrito coupons to give away at the station
if we can find the song for her.</p>

<p>Outside the station were 200 or so CDs being tossed, so I went
through the entire stack and pulled out about 4 for myself and
about 12 for presents for friends.  Nice!  Come by the station if
you want some CDs!</p>

<p>Then to Record Rack, where I said HI to Bruce and tried to sell
him 7 unopened CDs from the KTRU stack, but he said he couldn&rsquo;t
sell them.  Oh well, but oh yes he had NIN new album the fragile
(halo 14) which I bought after some internal debate.  Finally I
decided it was NIN; I had to have it.</p>

<p>Then home and listened to the album, while waiting for Amanda to
arrive so we could go see Happy Texas and we saw it and she went
home and here I am.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday I had fun at KTRU.  So much fun that I still want to
write about it 6 days later!!!</p>

<p>I had made a decision before I even started to play &ldquo;Coffee&rdquo; by Awol
off of a certain SKA compilation we have.  It&rsquo;s a good wake-up song
that I thought would be appropriate for 9am.</p>

<p>The song happened to be track 3 on the CD.</p>

<p>Ah, a gimmick for the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;HI This is Rob, and you&rsquo;re listening to K T R U Houston, 91.7fm.  I
have decided to only play track 3 from any CD I play today.  Or only
song 3 from any vinyl I play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I enjoyed the slight added challenge of finding CDs that would nicely
clash (I like to play jazz, then hardcore, then light classical, then
ska - keeps people wondering) <em>and</em> that had good songs for
track 3.</p>

<p>But the funniest funniest thing:</p>

<p>I found an audio book called <em>The Bear That Wasn&rsquo;t</em>.  You know,
like a book on tape so you can listen in your car?  Well, this was on
vinyl.  Well, not actually vinyl, but that old hard thick plastic that
was used for records back in the day. Remember?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember, but I know they were old.  Anyway, this &ldquo;book&rdquo; had 4
disks, and labels &ldquo;side 1&rdquo; through &ldquo;side 8&rdquo; on them.  I&rsquo;ll just play
side 3.</p>

<p>So I cued it up and it was all,
&ldquo;mmmmmoooooorrrrroooooollllaaaaammmmmmmm&rdquo; too slow, so I put it on
45rpm &ldquo;mmmoorrroowwwwaammmm&rdquo; still to slow????  OH my gosh it must be
78rpm!!</p>

<p>Our turntables don&rsquo;t have a 78rpm option.  But, they don&rsquo;t have to be
powered by the motor in order to produce sound.  So I spun the record
with my finger!  I just guessed at what sounded correct as far as the
voices and it was great fun!!  Just the grand silliness of me
broadcasting over live radio, on hundreds of thousands of dollars of
equipment, spinning Side 3 of <em>The Bear That Wasn&rsquo;t</em> with my
finger.</p>

<p>That is why I love KTRU.</p>

<p><p>Friday night is <a href="https://mkultra.txraves.org">MK Ultra</a> night at KTRU, so I cruised out there to say HI to Tejus and Eric, who was spinning ambient techno on the air!  Eric is great fun (same Eric who I DJed with about a month ago 1-4am) and I feel a certain comradery with him, since he&rsquo;s just getting started a spinning and mixing vinyl. It was great to watch and talk and see him get better.  He had great segues in his hour set except for one killer that elicited an agonizing groan from him as my ears went, &ldquo;ouch!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>When he was finished, Eric went home and Dustin came in to mix.  He scratched some records, including some old classical albums that are free for the taking at the station and Tejus and I were so impressed!</p>

<p><p>At 1am when the next DJs came in for their general shift, the input level for the mixing turntables is supposed to be turned off. (The DJs mix in a room different from the control room.) Tejus went in to get some lessons from Dustin on scratching and I noticed it was being broadcast over the music that was supposed to be playing! A caller called and asked for Tejus and I was all, &ldquo;um, he&rsquo;s busy being broadcast but he doesn&rsquo;t know it; are you listening now?&rdquo;  The caller was, and we all had a good laugh. Even Tejus when he found out about it.</p>

<p><p>Today started a new semester at KTRU.  My new shift is now Tuesdays from 9am to 11am.</p>

<p><p>This is my first semester with only a 2 hour shift!  Holy cow it went by so quickly today!</p>

<p><p>The coolest thing is that at 9am, no one is on before me, so I get to turn on the station in the morning.  So check it out each Tuesday at 9am CST (<a href="https://www.ktru.org/ktru.html">www.ktru.org</a>) and you can hear me make the official Sign On Announcement about the station and 50,000 watts and all that.</p>

<p><p>No one called me today at the station, well except for one person, but she was trying to reach someone else.  Oh well.</p>

<p><p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll have a contest this next Tuesday for free bumper stickers!!</p>

<p><p>Oh!!! And the funniest thing!  I gave the opening announcement and then was all, if you have any requests, call 713-___  and I gave <em>my</em> phone number!  No one called; apparently no one was listening.  Good thing because I said, &ldquo;holy shit that&rsquo;s my number!  Ooops I&rsquo;ll just stop talking now and play a song.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>That (saying &ldquo;shit&rdquo;) was my first FCC violation and I could be fined up to $10,000 dollars and be imprisoned for up to 2 years.  Doh!!</p>
