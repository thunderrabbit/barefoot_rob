                        <p class=date>15:46 Saturday 21 August 1999</p>

<p><p>Last night (and every Friday night) KTRU broadcast MK Ultra show - 3 hours of live DJs mixing jungle or techno or breakbeat or any basic rave music.  I love the show so I go to watch the DJs spin and basically just think, &ldquo;wow! [I wonder if I would enjoy spending enough time to get that good?]&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Last night Chris Anderson was spinning; he&rsquo;s big in the Houston rave scene and maybe way bigger than that; I know he&rsquo;s spinning in Santa Fe tonight.</p>

<p><p>So he&rsquo;s just echelons beyond me in all aspects of the skillz, but I enjoyed watching and talking to him.  All the DJs I&rsquo;ve talked to just said, &ldquo;practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Turntables are an integral part of this &ldquo;practice&rdquo; so I&rsquo;m thinking, &ldquo;where do I get turntables?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="15%"></p>

<p><p>At 12:50am, 10 minutes before the show was to end, Eric arrived to cover his 1 to 4am shift.  This surprised me because I was at the station exactly to cover for him (he had sent an email requesting a sub for his show; I was going to be at the station already, so I said yes).  This surprised him because he hadn&rsquo;t gotten my response to his request.</p>

<p><p>So we both stayed.</p>

<p><p>Eric and I had <em>so much <b>fun</b></em> cutting up laughing, cutting up vinyl and CDs, experimenting with sounds and stuff; it was great!</p>

<p><p>We took turns at the console; encouraging each other, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re doing great!&rdquo; and just generally having fun.</p>

<p><p>I mixed up DJ Silver &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Panic&rdquo; with Francis Dhomont &ldquo;Scherzo&rdquo;, which simply don&rsquo;t mix at all, but was great fun to experiment.  We&rsquo;ll bring tapes next week to record the fun for later playback.</p>

<p><p>Today I have jury duty.  The summons came by mail to my apartment while I was in Iowa.  When I saw the summons, I was like, &ldquo;uh oh- I hope I didn&rsquo;t miss it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t miss it.  But I did miss the fact that I am scheduled for KTRU on the same day.  Doh!  I caught this too late and requested a sub only a couple days ago.  I dunno what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>

<p><p>Maybe the station will be off the air for 3 hours.  Maybe I can shout, &ldquo;guilty!&rdquo; and be removed from the case.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll try to call some DJs today at a more decent hour.</p>

                        <p class=date>9pm Tuesday 19 May 1999</p>

<p><p>Today Jason and I worked for a few hours pulling phone cables down walls at a company where I installed about 28 cables, but hadn&rsquo;t pulled them down the walls.  We didn&rsquo;t have exactly the right tools to use, but we had a lot of fun and got most of them done.</p>

<p><p>We could have finished them all, but at noon, we had to leave.  I asked Renee, &ldquo;have you ever listened to KTRU?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I told her and then explained we would be leaving before completing the job and she could listen to us on the radio!</p>

<p><p>Packed up, went home, cleaned up, to the station, cued up a record and we had a blast.  Jason focused a lot on the ska stack, and the general stack, and I played pretty much whatever he gave me.  We inadvertantly played a song &ldquo;I want to be a punk&rdquo; by the Blanks 77 that said &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; in it 13 times, but the voice was pretty much unintelligible; I didn&rsquo;t even notice until the end of the song since I was busy on the phone and stuff.</p>

<p><p>Got lots of requests on the phone (I guess that&rsquo;s what happens with a day shift), and was able to play about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of them.  I couldn&rsquo;t find the rest, though I&rsquo;m sure part of that is simply due to my lack of knowledge about where various artists are located.</p>

<p><p>At one point I found Jimi Hendrix playing a live version of &ldquo;Wild Thing&rdquo; and I was all, cool! and went to play that back to back with Kermit the Frog&rsquo;s rendition of &ldquo;Wild Thing&rdquo; and Kermit CD was missing!!!</p>

<p><p>I was angry that someone would steal the Kermit Unpigged CD, and I told the station manager it was missing.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We pulled it out of the stacks; it was never supposed to be here in the first place, and it was being played <b>way</b> too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Well can I have it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure.  As long as you don&rsquo;t play it here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Yay!!!  So the CD is recovered into my private collection.</p>

<p><p>Though it took a while, Jason finally became more comfortable talking on the air, not a lot, but that&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p><p>At one point I had <em>Less Than Jake</em> CD cued up for him.  &ldquo;So Jason, what can you tell me about this band that I don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Who me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Um, yes, not anyone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re&hellip;good.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(pause)</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay fair enough,&rdquo; I laughed and played the song.</p>

<p><p>Wende came in (she had the afternoon off work) and helped choose CDs and helped me find some requested songs. That was great.  She found The Judys for me, and something else.</p>

<p><p>She was even more mic shy than Jason, but when she gave me a CD to play for her I was all, &ldquo;so Wende, what song is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(silence)</p>

<p><p>I turned the mic toward her, &ldquo;all ears are on you&hellip;&rdquo; I taunted.</p>

<p><p>Finally she overcame her fear. &ldquo;This is I-three with blah blah blah&rdquo; whatever it was.</p>

<p><p>Jason goes, &ldquo;very professional.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Then she even gave the name of the CD and I played it.</p>

<p><p>But, for the Big Huge Culmination of our show, we sang The Yogi Bear song live with no intro, no rehearsal, nothin.  It was great!  All you YRUUers would love it!  Jason has a tape of the show and most of the song recorded.  (I forgot to hit Record for the first 3 verses)</p>

<p><p>A song finished, I turned on the mic, we sang, I turned off the mic, I played another song.</p>

<p><p>Our shift was soon over, though the next DJ hadn&rsquo;t come in.  Meg said she would cover for him.  I put in Frankenstein Symphony and we left.</p>

                        <p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>
<p class=date>Thursday 15 April 1999</p>

<p><p>Wednesday Night dinner was at Chuck E. Cheese last night. We were there until like 10pm.  I played a race driving game against Jon several times in a row; he beat me about 60 percent of the time.  I didn&rsquo;t crawl in the ball crawl.</p>

<p><p>It was like 10pm ish by the time we left. I had to go to bed before KTRU.  Woke up and called KTRU at 1am to make sure Matt was there to let me in at 4am.  He was.  Actually, Allison answered the phone, which was unexpected; she was up there working on a paper.</p>

<p><p>Woke up 3:30 and drove to the station; Allison was still there!!!  She left, then Matt turned the station over to me at 4am.  I played a pretty good variety and had fun, but only had 1 caller all night!  Allison stepped back in for a brief second like around 4:30am.</p>

<p><p>A tad after 6:30 (after I knew Wende had to be awake), I played &ldquo;She Drives Me Crazy&rdquo; from <em>Kermit Unpigged</em> CD.  It was Kermit and Miss Piggy on vocals.</p>

<p><p>At exactly 6:56am I started the wack hidden track on the CD <em>Girl Crushes Boy</em> by Smile.  It is 4 minutes long and is samples from a telephone conversation where a girl totally has a crush on some guy.</p>

<p><p>At the very end he&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;anywhere you want, anytime between 6 and 6:30.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;okay, 6:30 in your pants, your place.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He goes, &ldquo;really?  okay.  Um, how about seven?&rdquo; and the track ends.</p>

<p><p>I paused for a second, &ldquo;&hellip;  it&rsquo;s seven o&rsquo;clock&hellip; . K-T-R-U Houston&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I went on to name all the songs I had just played, and announced that everyone had 17 hours to turn in their taxes.</p>

<p><p>I had told 3 people to be sure to listen right before 7am for that; I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do it for about a month or so, but just got the CD on Saturday.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="10%"></p>

<p><p>So it was 7am, and Mark wasn&rsquo;t there yet.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p><p>I cued up a Texas blues song or something and the phone rang (my second call of the night). I hoped it was Mark.  It was Jonathon.  He&rsquo;s the DJ who has the Wednesday 4-7am shift (He&rsquo;s new like me).  I had invited him to listen to my 7am entertainment.  He thought it sounded great and we talked a bit, but I told him I had to go and try to find Mark.</p>

<p><p>I put on one of my fav CDs called <em>Frankenstein Symphony</em> by Francis Dhomont.  The tracks are all just sounds with no beat - they are like subtle movie soundtrack noises for a horror flick.  But not that scary.</p>

<p><p>I called Mark&rsquo;s number, and it rang like 10 times.  I was just about to hang up when his room mate answered.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is Mark there?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Let me go see..&rdquo;   [pause]  &ldquo;he&rsquo;s sleepin&rsquo;; should I wake him up?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah totally wake his ass up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>[pause]</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;He said he&rsquo;ll be right there??&rdquo;  Room mate was intrigued that Mark knew what the call was about.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Cool.  How long?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>[pause] &ldquo;fifteen or twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;cool.  thanks.  bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So I just chilled and listened to Frankenstein Symphony.  The track was about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> over with 8 minutes left when I thought, &ldquo;boring.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So I grabbed an ambient techno CD called &ldquo;Astral Pilot&rdquo;, which just happened to have an 11 minute track of heavy ambient beats.  Awesome.</p>

<p><p>I cued up the CD and slowly faded the beats of Astral Pilot on top of Frankenstein Symphony, faded FS out, back in, AP out, back in, crazy just fade in out in out each different one, until FS got a tad interesting and I faded out Astral Pilot and paused the CD.</p>

<p><p>FS got dull again and I faded in the beats of AP, then switched them in and out every 4 beats.  So FS was in background and the beats would go [thump] [thump] [thump] <a href="pause">thump</a> (pause) (pause) (pause)
<br>[thump] [thump] [thump] <a href="pause">thump</a> (pause) (pause) (pause)
<br>[thump] [thump] [thump] <a href="pause">thump</a> (pause) (pause) (pause)
<br>[thump] [thump] [thump] <a href="pause">thump</a> (pause) (pause) (pause)
<br>[thump] [thump] [thump] <a href="pause">thump</a> (pause) (pause) (pause)</p>

<p><p>And then FS got interesting again and I faded out the beats for a bit and then back in and I got a phone call.  (My third one of the night).</p>

<p><p>It was a woman&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;What song have you been playing?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Heh.  &ldquo;Well, actually I&rsquo;ve been mixing two songs.  One is <em>Frankenstein Symphony</em> by Francis Dhomont, and the other is &lsquo;Astral Pilot&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;  She almost sounded disappointed, or maybe like, &ldquo;ah that explains it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Can you hear them right now?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I faded down Frankenstein Symphony, &ldquo;this is Astral Pilot.&rdquo;  I faded FS back in.  &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; I faded down AP, &ldquo;is Frankenstein Symphony.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s <em>that</em> for catering to a listener?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Pretty good.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Which one do you like better?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I like the Frankenstein Symphony better.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Cool.  I put that one on for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The track was just ending, so I bumped Frankenstein Symphony back to track 3, my favorite of the four on the CD.  Just then Mark walked in.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m late.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No sweat.&rdquo;  I told him what I had just been mixing and he laughed.  I asked him to let this one song continue for my unnamed listener and he said no problem.</p>

<p><p>Signed off the station log and went home.</p>

<p><p>Aw man, first, super duper special thanks to Wende for reminding me last night that today is Thursday and I was supposed to work at KTRU!!!!  I had totally forgotten it, and she mentioned it offhandedly (whatever that is supposed to mean) and I was like, &ldquo;!!!!!!!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wende and I had just eaten at Dude and Veronica&rsquo;s house and it was gettin&rsquo; late. We still had to go to Sterling McCall to get Scott after he had his timing belt and water pump replaced.</p>

<p><p>See, the water pump failed, causing the timing belt to break, so they didn&rsquo;t warranty anything. I wasn&rsquo;t super joyful, but thankful that now I have 1 year or 12000 miles warranty on my timing belt <em>and</em> my water pump!  $590 was the price they quoted me.</p>

<p><p>We got there at like 11:30pm and it was only $540. Yay. Drove home and finished reviewing a CD that I have had for a while. Couldn&rsquo;t print my review since my printer was out of ink. D&rsquo;oh! (No, I wasn&rsquo;t going to hand write the review after typing it so neatly).  Went to bed at like 1am.</p>

<p><p>I had napped earlier in the day, so 3:20 am didn&rsquo;t come tooo early. I got up, showered (first time I&rsquo;ve showered before KTRU) drove in.  Matt was there on the 1-3am shift so I got into the building no problem.</p>

<p><p>He was playing a spoken thing&ndash;this dude was eloquently describing just how completely depressed he was and how he masochistically kept himself alive as punishment. The simple act of being alive felt difficult for this man.  The track was like 15 or 30 minutes long of depressed depression. It ended delightfully close to 4am.  I played &ldquo;All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth&rdquo; to lighten the mood.</p>

<p><p>I played a pretty great variety.  One 30 minute set had like Tejano, reggae, rock, jazz, ska, hardcore rap, and a 30 second segment of Neil Armstrong first stepping onto the moon all mixed in.</p>

<p><p>Got a call like at 6:15 or so. It was the next DJ calling in sick, inviting me to simply turn off the station at 7am.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p><p>I told him I would probably hang out for a bit longer, maybe try to call some other DJs to get someone in.  He said thanks, but that it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal to turn the station off.</p>

<p><p>Then I got a call around 6:50 am.  It was Jen in New Hampshire!! Woah!  She got RealAudio and was listening to me on the web! That is so super cool. Wow. I was already having fun and now I felt inspired to just keep on spinning records. I went until 9am when the next next DJ arrived.</p>

<p><p>Went home, ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and went to bed for about 1.5 hours.</p>

<p><p>Had dreams of KTRU, taking requests and playing music, and not having the music that was requested. Not really <em>bad</em> not having the music, just <em>oh well</em> not having it.</p>

<p><p>Woke up, wrote a long letter for some youth stuff, and made travel plans to visit Great America in early May.</p>

<p><p>Travel-plan-making was great.  I have a guest pass on America West Airlines, so I called them, but they didn&rsquo;t have round trip service to the city I wanted to visit (Chicago).  I called Southwest, for which I have a $200+ voucher, but they don&rsquo;t fly to O&rsquo;Hare.  Hmmm.  So I called Jayne, my favorite bestest travel agent (281-359-1010) and she was all, &ldquo;you wanna go to O&rsquo;Hare?  You&rsquo;ve got $290 flight credit with Continental with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>WHOAH!!  Sign me up!   I was so super duper thankful that she remembered (maybe their computers remembered, but who cares) and wow.  Yes oh yes, and the ticket will only cost like $210 of that so I&rsquo;ll have like $80 left. Awesome.  Thank you Jayne; thank you Angels.</p>

<p><p>Then Dude and I went to play frisbee.  My disc was in Wende&rsquo;s truck so he bought an ultimate disc and we went to Rice to play. The wind was super breezy and shifty and not quite gusty, making play challenging.</p>

<p><p>I did well for not having practiced much and Dude got some great throws fairly consistently.  I noticed he did better when he didn&rsquo;t really try or concentrate, but just let it happen.</p>

<p><p>A team was in an adjacent field so we went and watched/talked with them. Once their scrimmage was over, I joined a 3 on 3 man quick game.</p>

<p><p>OH MY GOODNESS I was so winded. Stomach in a knot, phlegm in throat, tired, panting, hot! Wow. I will do that more often to keep in better shape.</p>

<p><p>I got some pretty good throws and catches in, but didn&rsquo;t play as great as I have in the past. I haven&rsquo;t practiced in quite a while. I enjoyed the exertion.</p>

<p><p>Now Dude and I are going to work on website stuff.</p>

                        <p class=date>5 April 1999</p>

<p><p>On Saturday morning I was on at KTRU from 7 to 9am.  On the way driving there, only static was on the station; that meant no one was there.  This brings to mind one question for me: &ldquo;will I be able to get into the station?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>More specifically, will I be able to get into the building in which the station is located?  I&rsquo;m not a student at Rice University, so I don&rsquo;t have a card that will let me into the building if it&rsquo;s locked.</p>

<p><p>It was locked. There are 3 doors that I try to get in. Two are on like the side, and sometimes they are closed, but not locked. This day they were locked.  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p><p>I tried a fourth door a bit further down, but it was also locked. I called Alison, the DJ director, but she wasn&rsquo;t at home. I called Dennis, the only other DJ whose number I had memorized (part of it spells WHARF) but he wasn&rsquo;t in, or wasn&rsquo;t answering the phone at 6:45 on Saturday morning.</p>

<p><p>There was a janitor inside.  He saw me and said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re closed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the DJ for KTRU! I need to get inside!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He shrugged helplessly.</p>

<p><p>Hmmmm.</p>

<p><p>JUST then, or actually a minute later, Nancy was driving by on a golfcart thing!  Nancy is my next door neighbor who happens to work on the Grounds and Maintenance Department of Rice. Wow!</p>

<p><p>I told her the situation.  She looked at her watch, &ldquo;well at least you&rsquo;ve got 8 minutes!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>She didn&rsquo;t have keys, but called the police station on the radio.  After a couple minutes it was determined they could not let me in; I was not on the list. (that reminds me I should write to Alison)  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>I told her about the custodian guy who was inside.  She called him on the radio, but no answer.  Maybe he was down in the basement.  After a few more minutes, we went back to the Fourth Door, and peered in.  We saw a cart; (someone should be near that, right?) and Nancy banged on the door.  She&rsquo;s got clout; she&rsquo;s worked there a while.</p>

<p><p>A man appeared inside the building to see what was up.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ding!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>What?</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his name,&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy, &ldquo;Ding!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He opened the door and she explained everything and he let me in no problem this time.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>I thanked Nancy who said no problem, and I thanked Ding who apologized and I said no problem, and I got up to the station at 6:58am.</p>

<p><p>Beautiful.  I turned the lights on, grabbed a CD with a nice long intro and turned on the mic.  Soon the station monitors went from static to silence to music and we were on the air!  It was so close to exactly 7am that I won&rsquo;t even say.</p>

<p><p>Wende says, &ldquo;it was like&hellip; Seven. On the dot.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>There you have it.  Nothing <em>horrible</em> would have happened had I not been on at seven.  I wouldn&rsquo;t have lost my job; the FCC wouldn&rsquo;t have cared, but it&rsquo;s a fun story.</p>

<p><p>Oh, and I&rsquo;ll be on tomorrow Tuesday 6 april 1999 from 1 to 3pm.  <a href="https://www.ktru.org">www.ktru.org</a></p>

<p class=date>21 December 1998</p>

<p>I am sure I mentioned previously that I applied to be a DJ at KTRU. I never heard back from them until I got this letter:

<p><font size="+1">
<b>To:</b> thunderrabbit@cheerful.com
<br><b>Subject:</b> KTRU Application

<pre>
hi, i am ellen's sister and i work at KTRU (i actually was the one 
who opened the door for you, although i didn't know it was you).  i know 
your brother, fred, although he always confuses me with a girl named lee 
meredith, and i also know mike ossowski (he doesn't confuse me with 
anybody) and perhaps other YRUUers that you would know.  anyhow, i am 
emailing you so that you do not get discouraged about your KTRU 
application.  the dj director either did not have enough time to hire 
for the christmas break, or didn't feel that we needed any new dj's at 
the time (my guess is the former, since we will be off at night 
probably).  i will make sure that your application remains on file for 
consideration in the spring.

good luck,
meg
