<p>I miss DJing; that was so much fun.   I just enjoyed communicating with Tom at KTRU during his Saturday midnight shift.  He played a song for me, which was awesome, though I didn&rsquo;t know it was for me until he mentioned it hahahaha.</p>

<p>OMG this is so amazing!!!</p>

<p>First, it&rsquo;s amazing that I can listen to KTRU at all on this fancy series of tubes called the internizz.   Second, Fred and I were listening to the Vinyl Frontier&rsquo;s Christmas show a couple nights ago; fun times.  but that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that MK Ultra show is still kickin&rsquo; it.  I enjoyed listening to the whole <a href="https://noise.rice.edu/ktru/sheet.nsf/15aa60c8727df106802568e90056b4d1/9b62ecd77c6ac6e386257ae300124f48?OpenDocument">3 hours played by Dijon</a>, so I called him near the end just to say HI and what&rsquo;s up from Tokyo, etc.  We chatted for a bit, mostly me asking what had changed and what has stayed the same at the station in all those years since I was there.</p>

<p>He ended his shift with a song by an artist from Tokyo, then he closed his show with something like, &ldquo;yeah that was <artist name> all the way from <strong>Japan</strong>,&rdquo; giving just a bit of emphasis to the final word so I knew he was saying HI to me.</p>

<p>I called <em>back</em>, and the next DJ (TomZ) answered.  &ldquo;Dijon?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No he&rsquo;s in the other room; how can I help you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just wanted to thank him for the shout out to Japan; I called him from Tokyo a second ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!  You&rsquo;re the Tokyo guy! hang on&rdquo;</p>

<p>I held; I said thanks to Dijon and got his IM address.   Moments later, via text message, Dijon assured me I should listen to the next DJ, TomZ.</p>

<p>3:01 PM dijon: sup rob, thanks for listening tonight. the dude who&rsquo;s on now is crazy&hellip; i&rsquo;d keep listening for a minute if you&rsquo;re able.</p>

<p> me: With that invitation, how can I resist?? ;-)</p>

<p>  Thank you for playing even while having a bit of a cough&hellip; keeping the music moving!</p>

<p>3:02 PM if you&rsquo;re still in the staiton[sic], tell him I&rsquo;m still listening. :-) yes, he sounds a bit crazy!</p>

<p>3:04 PM dijon: tom&rsquo;s chill. i gave him the message and he threw his hands in the air in an expression of pure joy</p>

<p>After that, things went a bit crazy.</p>

<p>TomZ came on the air between songs like, &ldquo;thanks for listening Thunder Rabbit! All the way from Tokyo.  By the way, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember, but I used to rollerblade with you back in the day, so anyway, thanks for listening&rdquo;</p>

<p>WHAT?????   Holy cats my brain was like WHAT??  How can he remember that?  How can I remember him??  I met so many people inline skating&hellip;   But Google has the memory of a massive computer brain so (while Tom was playing some noise music,) I looked it up, and found <a href="https://robnugen.com/cgi-bin/journal.pl?type=skate&amp;date=1995/01/20">a skate entry, at the very bottom of which is Tom&rsquo;s name.</a></p>

<p>While texting Tom that journal entry, plus &ldquo;my wife doesn&rsquo;t like this noise music haha,&rdquo; he was on air again, confirming my previous &ldquo;WHAT&rdquo; message with, &ldquo;yeah, back in the day, we met while skating, and I was like, wow that&rsquo;s cool.. and&hellip; life goes on,&rdquo; and while he was speaking, more brain cells started to wake up in my brain, &hellip; &ldquo;he sounds like that guy who ran for City Council!  What was his name???&rdquo; and I text <em>that</em> to him, and I was right!</p>

<p>He laughed, like, &ldquo;heh.  Yeah.  Back in 19__ I ran for City Council At Large position #4, and got 19,474 votes which was 18% of the vote that year&hellip; &ldquo;  etc, &ldquo;so maybe some memories are happening..  Oh, and hi wifey who doesn&rsquo;t like noise music!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing this since then so haven&rsquo;t written back, but I&rsquo;ll send him the link right &hellip; now.</p>

<p>PS: TomZ, Lin says HI!</p>

the door code has been changed and the stickers have all been removed 
from the outside door.  it's over.  and we've lost.


i'm up at the station now and it's not a pretty picture. either we do
something now or not at all, but if we do anything it must be 
coordinated
and immediate.

Subject:  From Dr. Camacho

Dear KTRU volunteers:

As I am sure you are aware, students on duty Tuesday
evening deliberately disrupted the KTRU broadcast of
the Rice University women's basketball game.  This
demonstrated a lack of respect for fellow students
on the basketball team, for a Rice student activity
and for the listeners.  It demonstrated a lack of
responsibility in the use of university-owned broadcast 
facilities.  And  it deliberately subverted programming 
approved by the responsible  university parties,
including the KTRU advisory committee and the Vice
President for Student Affairs, to whom authority to
determine policy is delegated by the President and the
Board of  Trustees, the owners of the FCC license.

As a consequence, the university is reorganizing the
operation of KTRU. During this reorganization,
operation by the current volunteers is suspended 
from 8 a.m., Thursday, November 30 until further
notice.

Dr. Hutchinson and I have accepted an invitation from
Johnny to attend a meeting of the KTRU volunteers at 
6 p.m. this evening.  The decision to reorganize the
operation of the station is final.  The discussion at
this point should be about the opportunities for 
tudent participation in the reorganized KTRU.  We
remain committed to the concept of a university-owned,
student-operated radio station with appropriate lines
of accountability.

Sincerely,
Zenaido Camacho
Vice President for Student Affairs

<p><p>Wow, I say.  Wow.  Interesting that I had already
mentioned that I might not apply again for the winter
shift.  Then this morning I decided I would apply.
Now I see this.  I&rsquo;ll still apply, just in case I get
to DJ more.</p>

To:      Rob Nugen

OPERATOR REPORT ERROR NOTICE

This is to inform you of a problem in your entry on the operator
report (log) for 6/17/00.

You forgot to include the time when you signed off on the log. 

Please fix your entry the next time you are at the station.  Thanks,

If you have any questions please ask your Program Director
or reply to this e-mail.
</pre>

<p><p>The above email is referring to the official FCC log.  It has
entries like this:</p>

<pre>
Time     Operator    ON/OFF
--------------------------
 4:01  (SigNatuRE)    ON
 7:02  (SigNatuRE)    OFF
 7:02  (sigNATure)    ON
       (sigNATure)    OFF
10:00  (SIgnaTUre)    ON
 1:00  (SIgnaTUre)    OFF
</pre>

<p><p>The different capitalizations of &ldquo;signature&rdquo; indicate different
people&rsquo;s signature.  DJ one signed on at 4:01 and off at 7:02.
Legally, the next DJ (in this case, me) must sign on at the exact same
time (in this case, 7:02)</p>

<p><p>When I sign on, I always also sign the next line and write OFF, but
leave the time space blank so it can be filled in when I leave.  That
way, if I forget to sign off, the next DJ can simply write in the time
s/he signed on into my off slot.</p>

<p><p>So this is the second week I&rsquo;ve forgotten, and I will accept full
responsibility for having forgotten.  I FORGOT TO WRITE DOWN THE TIME
THAT I LEFT THE STATION!!  There.  But, ya know, it seems to me that
the next DJ could just do the little favor and write down the time for
me.</p>

<p><p>I won&rsquo;t be there this Saturday; I may forget to mention it to the
next DJ, but I&rsquo;m going to ask the general manager if it&rsquo;s legal etc.</p>

<p><p>KTRU required more than twice as much paperwork today, which made
for a sub-amazing show.  We always have to write down each song artist
and title that we play.  But today we had to <em>also</em> write in a
different log, the artist, title, song writer/composer, and the time
the song was played.</p>

<p><p>The biggest pain in the bootay about all that is figuring out who
is the writer or composer!  Some CDs are great: &ldquo;All songs written by
___________&rdquo; Some just said, &ldquo;All songs copyright _________&rdquo; (which I
used as the writer), but some didn&rsquo;t have crap for the writer, so I
spent a lot of extra time, reading the fine print of CDs looking for
ones that I could easily determine who wrote the things!</p>

<p><p>At least half of the CDs I had originally selected were
subsequently put back in the stack unplayed; I didn&rsquo;t know who to
credit.  This is kinda a pisser for those artist who did write the
songs - now they won&rsquo;t get credit nor paid for it&hellip;  (That&rsquo;s the
whole idea - keep track of who wrote the songs so they get paid
royalties)</p>

<p><p>Anyway, My show as sloppier than usual, and I didn&rsquo;t get enough playlist or alternative tracks played.  Oh well.  Next week I&rsquo;ll do it, but this week, the playlist and alternate tracks can bite my butt.</p>

<p><p>Wende called during my so, so I put her on speakerphone as I cued up tracks and played stuff.  After a bit I was all &ldquo;okay be quiet; I&rsquo;m &lsquo;bout to go on air.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;okay&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>(on air) &ldquo;you are listening to [crash] KT (snicker)&hellip;ahem  You are listening to KTRU Houston, Rice Radio.&rdquo;  I read through the list of song I had played, then played the next song.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wende!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry!  I was in the garage&hellip; I tried to be quiet, but I knocked something over.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=date>11:33pm CDT Saturday 20 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Wow!  My new KTRU shift is 7 to 10 pm Saturdays during the summer.
Ironically, I will not be available for my next two shifts; I&rsquo;ll be at
YAC retreat and OKC rally respectively.</p>

<p><p>Today I had four (4), count-em 4 DJs-in-training during my shift!
I feel pretty honored to <em>train</em> DJs, when it seems like just a
year ago that Alexis trained me.  (It was a year ago)   Awwwww.</p>

<p><p>The shift was great fun, and seemed to go really quickly with all
the people in there helping and asking questions and such.  Three of
them went on mic (it was their second training) and all four of them
cued up and played music.  All of them made good beginner DJ errors
that I made back in the day.  Very comforting.  I even showed them
cueing errors on vinyl so they could know what not to do, and how to
recover from it.</p>

<p><p>I finally got to meet Jesse.  He&rsquo;s the DJ after me, and I&rsquo;ve heard
his voice a lot, but never had met him.  He&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Today Wende and her best friend from high school Irene and Irene&rsquo;s
fiance&rsquo; Nick (from Down Under) and Irene&rsquo;s brother Tom all went to
Astroworld.  I greatly enjoyed hearing the stories from their point of
view.  I haven&rsquo;t been this year (I don&rsquo;t have a Season Pass) because
they didn&rsquo;t put in a new roller coaster.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Today (while they were at Astroworld), I was at investment club
meeting.  It was good and productive once we finally got down to
business.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Oh, before investment club meeting was the final competition in the
spring ultimate tournament!  Our team had 2 morning games, a Bye (rest
while others play) then 2 afternoon games.  I said &lsquo;bye-bye for real&rsquo;
at the Bye to attend my meeting.  We had lost both games before that;
I wonder how they did in the afternoon&hellip;.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>This morning I had a dream that OKC rally was really bad because we
didn&rsquo;t play Silent Football!!  We will have to play!</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m tired and going to bed!</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>OH!  Last thing..  Today while I was at KTRU, someone called and
asked for me.  One of the DJs said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your girlfriend again.&rdquo;  I
answered the phone and it was kT!!  She was calling from Anna&rsquo;s house
to report the results of her secret spy mission: Anna will be speaking
at church at 11:00am tomorrow.  We&rsquo;re going to surprise her there!</p>

<p><p>If you read this before tomorrow morning, don&rsquo;t tell Anna!</p>

<p><p>KTRU was great fun today- had a new listener call in, &ldquo;I just found this
station yesterday!&rdquo;  I snail mailed him some bumper stickers. A few people
requested various artists, and I mostly was able to find them all.</p>

<p><p>A woman named Lynn (sp) called a few times, requesting different artists
- Nick Cave and the somethings, also another artist we didn&rsquo;t have, and The
Feelies, which we did have.  It was the last track of my show.  We have
Caller ID at the station, so I knew it was her each time she called; we
were flirtatious; I told her I&rsquo;ll be on next week from 9 to 11am.</p>

<p><p>After KTRU I visited my chiropractor; my back has been one big spasm
waiting to happen since yesterday.  It&rsquo;s not perfecto today, but better.
 She adjusted it, and when that didn&rsquo;t really work, she accupunctured me
with five needles.  That was great fun!</p>

<p><p>Now I&rsquo;m at work.  I&rsquo;m way stable compared to Monday and Tuesday.  Nice.</p>
