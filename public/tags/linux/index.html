<p>My inflight entertainment system rebooted itself and I got a few pics
of the logs.  Looks like it&rsquo;s running X Window on Linux.  Seems
reasonable.  Weird that mine rebooted while it seems none of the
others did.  Do we each have our own virtual server?</p>

<p><p>Yay!</p>

<p><p>After pretty much working on it all day, I got my linux box up and running ppp, I downloaded netscape, installed it, created user accounts for myself and Wende, and all is great!!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve even customized things a bit more this time around (as opposed to last time I had linux on my machine) making it easier to set up new accounts and stuff.  I&rsquo;m happy.</p>

<p><p>I had two major problems with getting ppp to work.  First, the modem I had purchased was a PNP for Windows and it hadn&rsquo;t a Prayer on linux.  I returned the modem and reconfigured the jumpers to make it /dev/cua2  (COM3 in DOS/Win terminology) and it worked.  ppp still didn&rsquo;t work though..  After a lot of poking around, I finally went through the book step by step.  Turns out I had forgotten to make one of the scripts an executable script. That fixed it and ppp now works on linux!</p>

<p><p>I was therefore able to finger and talk my brother&rsquo;s account, but he didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>

<p><p>I downloaded netscape 4.08 (4.51 was available, but I wasn&rsquo;t impressed with 4.51 on Win; so I chose not to try it on linux) and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m using now for this entry!</p>

<p><p>My intention is to ween myself off of Windows and Microsoft stuff entirely.  I&rsquo;ll keep the old box for a while, but for internet stuff I&rsquo;m pretty much on linux now for good.  I still have my Quicken stuff on my other machine..  is Quicken available for linux?</p>

<p><p>So that&rsquo;s it.  I&rsquo;m quite pleased with myself for getting it all to work; pleased with linux for being a free operating system (and one that is stable) and just plain pleased.</p>

<p><p>Back some months (year?) ago, I worked on installing Linux and Windows on one machine.  I had big problems at first with Windows trying to be the main boot manager, but finally was able to get it to all work in relative harmony.  When I installed Windows 98 on the same machine, intending for it to replace only the Windows 95 partition, tragedy struck, I lost Linux accessibility altogether, and Win98 was unstable like anything, so I started from scratch again.</p>

<p><p>Since then I have purchased a new machine (that I&rsquo;m using now) and for some reason though I have 128 megs of RAM, Netscape is complaining about out-of-memory when I pull up more than like 3 netscape windows.  It didn&rsquo;t previously have a problem with this; I don&rsquo;t know what is the problem.  (If you know please email me at <a href="mailto:rob-nugen@flash.net">rob-nugen@flash.net</a> (take out the spam reducing hyphen))</p>

<p><p>So I&rsquo;ve got two machines (actually 3 counting my cute <sup>486</sup>&frasl;<sub>33</sub> DOS based machine with some cool old files) and I intend to put linux on the other and use it for web browsing type stuff.  We&rsquo;ll see how it all goes.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>I went to Astroworld yesterday and Serial Thriller was running, but not open to the public.  The ride has some great inversions, including <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> a loop, a full corkscrew, then the other <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of the loop.  Other maneuvers were there, but I couldn&rsquo;t really see them because of trees.</p>

<p><p>It opens on Saturday to the public.  I will be there.</p>

<p><p>I rode all the cool coasters at least twice (Texas Tornado I rode 6 times) to get them out of my system for a bit.  Saturday total focus will be Serial Thriller.</p>

<p><p>Today I&rsquo;ll be at KTRU from 1-4 covering for Robert, and then I&rsquo;ll learn how to broadcast the Rice baseball game so I can make 35 bucks doing that in an afternoon.</p>

<p><p>The machine I wanted to convert to linux, apparently, for no apparent reason, has broken.</p>

<p><p>It was so cute - Win 95 with almost no drivers, almost nothing on the disk..  I copied to floppies a couple of files that I wanted to keep, and I was ready to install linux.</p>

<p><p>Taking an inventory of the machine, I booted it a couple times to see what chipset was on the video card.  It didn&rsquo;t say how much memory was on the card, so I powered down and removed the card.  I couldn&rsquo;t really tell, so I put the card back in.</p>

<p><p>Turned it on and got angry BEEEEEPs back.  No signal to the monitor.  What???  All I did was remove and replace the video card.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve tried another video card and it did not work.  I have no idea what I may have done.  Sigh.  It was a PII 233.  Do I need a new motherboard?  New CPU?  What could I have done?</p>
