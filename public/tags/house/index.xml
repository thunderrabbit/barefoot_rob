Christmas Day in Presidente Prudente At R&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo;s house in Presidente Prudente, Brazil, which looks to me like a house I would see in a movie. Pool in the yard overlooked by floor to ceiling glass door/walls separating indoor and outdoor living/dining areas
Super sweet talking wtih Rose last night about jacks and marbles in the street vs kids with cellphones now.
Jesse and Angelica joined us for dinner.</description>

      <description>08:56 Friday 13 January 2017 JST I should be receiving new shelves today, between 9am and noon. Lin&amp;rsquo;s way more excited about them than I am, but I look forward to having more space so I can more likely finish unpacking. (I started unpacking in early June 2016.)
  
15:46 Friday 13 January 2017 JST    
Once we got home after buying the shelves, I realized that these shelves don&amp;rsquo;t provide a place for my printer.</description>

      <description>09:07 Wednesday 23 November 2016 JST The light bulb way up on the ceiling burned out. It would take a long skinny ladder that can be placed on steps.. or a long reach by me standing on the wall at the top of our landing.
When Lin gets home she&amp;rsquo;ll be all &amp;ldquo;what??? how did you do it????&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>21:59 Saturday 11 June 2016 JST We moved all our stuff in on 3 June, and now it&amp;rsquo;s 11 June. Lin is almost done unpacking. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a good start unpacking.
I just affixed an extension cord+splitter to my bedside table. I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for Lin to finish her shower so I can fill in the price and the shelf name. I think it was Hermes.
We walked to a home center and bought some strong &amp;ldquo;scissors&amp;rdquo; for cutting plants, plus a broom, which I carried in my back pocket, sticking up out of my shirt.</description>

      <description>20:12 Saturday 28 May 2016 JST Today Lin drove us to our new house where we met the real estate guy and got the keys! I&amp;rsquo;m not feeling as excited as I did when we saw it. I guess this feeling has been described as &amp;ldquo;buyer&amp;rsquo;s remorse&amp;rdquo; or maybe even &amp;ldquo;cold feet.&amp;rdquo;
We set off some bug killers in the house and headed to イケア to get furniture and stuff.</description>

      <description>18:27 Tuesday 23 February 2016 JST Yay! We&amp;rsquo;ve officially been approved for a loan to buy the house we found in 百合ケ丘. I&amp;rsquo;m glad because the kanji isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly difficult!
I&amp;rsquo;m also glad because we&amp;rsquo;ll have a house!</description>

      <title>Applied for house loan</title>

      <description>07:06 Thursday 18 February 2016 JST yesterday Lin and I applied for a bank loan to buy our new house! The negative interest rates hadn&amp;rsquo;t trickled down yet apparently, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see what kinda rate we are offered. I think I heard the real estate guy say 0.77% which I guess is reasonable.
After applying, we went through the house and too measurements of every room.

Afterward, I headed to work from new station (we&amp;rsquo;re 22 minutes&amp;rsquo; walk from 新百合ケ丘).</description>

      <description>21:10 Sunday 07 February 2016 JST Today Lin and I signed the application to buy our new house! We still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten the official word from the bank, but their initial assessment says they&amp;rsquo;ll give loan magically smurf the money into existence and let us pay them back for the service!</description>

      <title>Looking at an all-electric house near 新百合ケ丘</title>

      <description>13:21 Saturday 16 January 2016 JST I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that I like all electric for practical reasons: harder to start a fire by forgetting chicken in the broiler; I also like it for optimistic reasons: I like to think in the next N years while we live there, zero-point energy technology will be open-sourced so we can dramatically reduce our energy costs.
As I&amp;rsquo;m writing this, Lin&amp;rsquo;s writing &amp;ldquo;shit stuff&amp;rdquo; on some kind of registration form for the real estate company who will take us to see the house.</description>

      <description>11:15 Saturday 09 January 2016 JST Lin and I are on 南武線 now to look at some houses near Yomiuriland!
15:37 Of the three houses we saw, we both agree on their order of awesomeness. The most awesome one has a loft, is built with old school wooden building techniques, and features beams above the living room upon which the cats and I can walk. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% sure they are s00p3r str0ng enough to hold me easily, but I kinda bet they are.</description>

      <description>16:18 Sunday 03 January 2016 JST I still like it. Lin seems to still like it.
The refrigerator space is 75cm wide, and 60cm deep on the door side (next to stove + sink counter), and 90cm deep on the hinge side.
Living+dining room is like 300cm by 650cm overall, with about 3x3 meters for each space.
18:05 Lin spoke with builder, who is also the agent. I want to ask him</description>

      <description>13:01 Sunday 27 December 2015 JST Lin and I are on 南武線 headed to 登戸駅 where we&amp;rsquo;ll change to 小田急線 and go to 鶴川駅 for a nice little walk to the house!
登戸駅 is next!
13:22 We barely missed the local train, but we caught up to it in 新百合ケ丘 by taking the express train. The local train has been passed by two express trains now, which means that&amp;rsquo;s something we&amp;rsquo;d have to enjoy/endure/consider if we moved to 百合ヶ丘, at which (according to Lin) only local trains stop.</description>

      <description>11:09 Friday 25 December 2015 JST As soon as we walked in to the first house, Lin was like, &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s go&amp;rdquo; because the pictures she saw didn&amp;rsquo;t match the reality as well as she hoped. The house is located near the top of a small hill/culdesac with pretty small room for manuevering to park.
12:03 The second house on our tour was much nicer. It&amp;rsquo;s bright, clean, and has lots of storage.</description>

      <description>08:20 Tuesday 15 December 2015 JST It&amp;rsquo;s 888万円 so a bit more than the other, but a lot nicer so wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need any renovation.
20:08 Tuesday 15 December 2015 JST So it looks pretty great! I still want to keep looking at different places until we&amp;rsquo;ve seen about 20, but yeah the hardwood floors look lovely. And it&amp;rsquo;s quite huge compared to our current space.</description>

      <description>11:56 Saturday 12 December 2015 JST I didn&amp;rsquo;t take many pictures, but I liked the house; it&amp;rsquo;s on a hill but doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be in danger of sliding down in an earthquake. There&amp;rsquo;s a screen of tall bamboo behind the house, which I think is really pretty, and pretty convenient if we ever need a giant stalk of bamboo.
It&amp;rsquo;s smaller than our current place, which concerns Lin a bit.</description>

      <description>##6:20am Tuesday 4 March 2014 JST##
We moved! Our new house is great, though a bit farther from the station. However, that gives me a chance to take a walk each morning and evening. I allocate 30 minutes walking time each direction. Not sure how far it actually is, but probably around 2km. 2.6km according to Google.
The key words for this house are big and nice. Oh, and cats (surrounding).</description>
