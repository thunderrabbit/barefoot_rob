<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that I like all electric for practical reasons: harder to
start a fire by forgetting chicken in the broiler; I also like it for
optimistic reasons: I like to think in the next N years while we live
there, zero-point energy technology will be open-sourced so we can
dramatically reduce our energy costs.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m writing this, Lin&rsquo;s writing &ldquo;shit stuff&rdquo; on some kind of
registration form for the real estate company who will take us to see
the house.  The family is still in the house, so it will be
interesting to see their gear, but a bit like &ldquo;hi sorry we&rsquo;re in your
house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh my gosh we loved it and loved them!  After seeing the house and the
surrounding area, we told the real estate agent YES, and we&rsquo;ll see if
the bank agrees.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I wrote on Lin&rsquo;s phone (because my phone&rsquo;s battery had died)</p>

<pre><code>The house is fucking fantastic and in a great location. Plus great
insulation on most of the windows and plenty of space ace for Mama to
live hang clothes etc. cats have ample space to chill and there's a
fun place to watch downstairs from the top of the stairs.

I'm seriously thankful for the place

Interesting point is they don't yet have a place in mind to move so I
was thinking they can sell to us and then rent from us.  Turns out
Japan is Japanese and that kinda thing is &quot;difficult&quot; So instead they
can just take their time to look because we have plenty of time to
wait. I'm happy to stay in touch with the family because I felt really
nice energy from the mom and daughters, a sibling of whom appears to
be on the way!

Right now 3:17pm we are rolling round the good as he's showing us
stuff to which I am paying little attention hahaha
</code></pre>

<p>The real estate company had done an inspection on the house just 6 months before, and it passed with great marks on all sides (including foundation and roof!)</p>

<p>Lin and I are on 南武線 now to look at some houses near Yomiuriland!</p>

<h2 id="15-37">15:37</h2>

<p>Of the three houses we saw, we both agree on their order of
awesomeness.  The most awesome one has a loft, is built with old
school wooden building techniques, and features beams above the living
room upon which the cats and I can walk.  I&rsquo;m not 100% sure they are
s00p3r str0ng enough to hold me easily, but I kinda bet they are.  For
the cats, they&rsquo;re quite fine.</p>

<p>Right now as I write this, we&rsquo;re on a bus heading to 百合ヶ丘 station,
the kanji for which is quite easy to write, so that&rsquo;s nice too.  Lin
is talking to a 75 year old woman who we met on the way to the bus
stop.  She seems quite genki for her age, possibly in part due to the
hills in the area.</p>

<h2 id="15-44">15:44</h2>

<p>Wow we&rsquo;re already at the station; that was quick!</p>

<p>But perhaps most importantly, we&rsquo;re within <em>walking</em> distance of
Yomiuri Land!!</p>

<p>Here are pics of the house we like best:</p>

<p>I still like it.  Lin seems to still like it.</p>

<p>The refrigerator space is 75cm wide, and 60cm deep on the door side
(next to stove + sink counter), and 90cm deep on the hinge side.</p>

<p>Living+dining room is like 300cm by 650cm overall, with about 3x3
meters for each space.</p>

<h2 id="18-05">18:05</h2>

<p>Lin spoke with builder, who is also the agent.  I want to ask him</p>

<pre><code>What was the original price of the house?
Are house values over the last 10 years trending up in this area?
Are these cracks anything to worry about?

<p>Lin and I are on 南武線 headed to 登戸駅 where we&rsquo;ll change to
小田急線 and go to 鶴川駅 for a nice little walk to the house!</p>

<p>登戸駅 is next!</p>

<h2 id="13-22">13:22</h2>

<p>We barely missed the local train, but we caught up to it in 新百合ケ丘
by taking the express train.  The local train has been passed by two
express trains now, which means that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;d have to
enjoy/endure/consider if we moved to 百合ヶ丘, at which (according to
Lin) only local trains stop.</p>

<h2 id="15-42">15:42</h2>

<p>I reallly really really like the house, its location, etc.  We
selected runes:</p>

<p>Overview:</p>

<p>dagaz</p>

<p>berkana reversed   (appropriate action)</p>

<p>Dagaz is like breakthrough and berkana is like &ldquo;make sure you think of
others (ママ) as well, ね？</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of a hill, but overall it&rsquo;s closer to the station than
we are now, I think the hill will be a bit of a challenge for Lin&rsquo;s
mom at first, but that it would reallllly help her get fit and trim,
which I judge will help her be more healthy overall.</p>

<h2 id="11-09-friday-25-december-2015-jst">11:09 Friday 25 December 2015 JST</h2>

<p>As soon as we walked in to the first house, Lin was like, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go&rdquo;
because the pictures she saw didn&rsquo;t match the reality as well as she
hoped.  The house is located near the top of a small hill/culdesac
with pretty small room for manuevering to park.</p>

<h2 id="12-03">12:03</h2>

<p>The second house on our tour was much nicer.  It&rsquo;s bright, clean, and
has lots of storage.  But the bathroom area is a bit small.  The
street it&rsquo;s on is small, serving only the 11 (max, possibly only 9)
houses on it.  The cats would have a relatively safe place to be cats.</p>

<h2 id="12-30">12:30</h2>

<p>Lin is in the third house now, talking to the agent.  I&rsquo;m in the car
because we&rsquo;re not allowed to park on the street, so we&rsquo;ve got the
hazard lights on.  I&rsquo;m thinking our cats would not be particularly
safe here, unless they got smart about traffic.  There isn&rsquo;t a ton
right now, but this is like a 35mph zone, big enough for buses to
use.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s been up there for more than five minutes would could just be due
to the sales guy, but might also be because she likes it.  I thought I
heard her happy voice upon entering.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s apparently a safe neighborhood for kids; there&rsquo;s been a
steady stream of them along the street and zero adults with them.  Ah;
one adult, but well over 200 kids I bet.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 12:55, and Lin&rsquo;s coming down now. She&rsquo;s asking lots of questions
and negotiating with the guy.</p>

<h2 id="12-56">12:56</h2>

<p>I went up to check it out; it&rsquo;s pretty nice! A bit old, and Lin wants
to replace all the wallpaper and flooring(?) which I think is a bit
extravagant, but who knows if we&rsquo;ll even settle on this house.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s definitely the nicest of the three houses we saw today, but it&rsquo;s
right on a pretty busy road.  I think the traffic noise will be
annoying and the traffic noise makers might be deadly for the cats.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 888万円 so a bit more than the other, but a lot nicer so wouldn&rsquo;t
need any renovation.</p>

<p>So it looks pretty great!  I still want to keep looking at different
places until we&rsquo;ve seen about 20, but yeah the hardwood floors look
lovely.  And it&rsquo;s quite huge compared to our current space.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t take many pictures, but I liked the house; it&rsquo;s on a hill but
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in danger of sliding down in an earthquake.
There&rsquo;s a screen of tall bamboo behind the house, which I think is
really pretty, and pretty convenient if we ever need a giant stalk of
bamboo.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s smaller than our current place, which concerns Lin a bit.  I just
see that the place is relatively inexpensive, in an area that I think
will increase in value, given Tokyo&rsquo;s proximity, and that the new
maglev train will stop in Hashimoto in ~12 years.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an elementary school, as well as a hospital nearby, so that
should help keep its resale value high.</p>

<h2 id="13-36">13:36</h2>

<p>The second place we looked at didn&rsquo;t catch my fancy; it looked
sterile, with no grass out front (just concrete and decorative gravel
for parking).  Inside stank of stale smoke so I didn&rsquo;t even venture
past the 玄関前</p>

<p>Wise words from MDX cooled my brain with some patience</p>

<pre><code>What's the lot size and is there some flat land? And can you grow on
it if that is an interest? The other question is how do you envision
life after moving? In other words unless the commute is a non issue,
that should be considered.

<p>We moved!  Our new house is great, though a bit farther from the station.  However, that gives me a chance to take a walk each morning and evening.  I allocate 30 minutes walking time each direction.  Not sure how far it actually is, but probably around 2km.  2.6km according to Google.</p>

<p>The key words for this house are big and nice.  Oh, and cats (surrounding).</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have internet connected yet, but have fiber installed in our living room!  Now my computer will be the bottleneck; that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to an electric shop looking for coaxial cable for the TV connection.  (sigh)   They only had 5m max (not nearly far enough to reach the station!!) but I needed 15 meters (routed at right angles along the edges of the room) to reach the spot where Lin wants the TV.  They said it would take a day at 9800 yen to make.  Ummmmm no thanks.</p>

<p>On the way home, I saw an <del>old guy</del> elderly gentleman in a shop that looked like my dad&rsquo;s garage.   I scoped the signs and could read enough to know he was a handyman.  I was like, &ldquo;hey, uh, do you happen to have coaxial TV cable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had to dig around a bit, but the short version is YES, he made 15 meters and gave it to me free.  whoooooo!!!!</p>
