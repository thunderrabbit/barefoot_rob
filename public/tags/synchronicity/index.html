                        <p>Wandering a bit aimlessly, I discovered there&rsquo;s a lounge where certain
customers can chill and maybe get food and drinks..  I am apparently
not one of those customers, so I don&rsquo;t know!</p>

<p>Rejected, but not too dejected, I noticed an information booth so went
to talk to them.  I found out exactly what kind of customer is allowed
(over 50,000 miles), but she wasn&rsquo;t able to look up the mileage I have
since I am flying on a different airline.</p>

<p>Turned around and noticed a cool little exhibit type thing where we
can create wood block prints at no charge!  Wow!  Perfect gift for
Colleen, and with the perfect timing: I had just enough time to make
the print before boarding started on my flight!</p>

                        <p>Mark synchronistically got on the same train car as me and we had a
great quick check-in.  I was able to dump everything about work and
computer things going unexpectedly, and he told me about a cool set of
questions he found that may work well in our
<a href="https://www.mkpjapan.org">men&rsquo;s circle</a>.</p>

<p>We did not have long to hang out so just quick stories and then long
wave bye as we had to go on separate trains in 代々木上原 station.</p>

<p>Headed to the station I realized I had left my wallet etc at the
workshop location.</p>

<p>Great timing to find them before they got across the street and out of
site.  Rin let me back in and discovered some of the lights were still
on so she got a chance to turn them off.  Perfect synchronicity again.</p>

<p>I am not sure how all this works, but I plan to join
<a href="https://soness.com/">Soness</a>&rsquo;s
<a href="https://courses.yourspeakingjourney.com/">Get Booked to Speak in a Week</a>
class starting tomorrow.  So that means between tomorrow and the week
after, I should get booked to speak.  Does it count if I get booked
today, before the class starts?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really a <em>speaking</em> engagement, but come on out to Bar
GariGari on June 1st for <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Apocrypha/events/249933126/">story telling night</a></p>

<p>My right elbow has been hurting from too much mousing, I think.  I got
a recommendation from Tariq, via one of his students.</p>

<pre><code>His name is 吉川泰弘
The nearest station is 駒沢大学駅
His clinic's name is 駒沢病院
His position there is 整形外科部長
</code></pre>

<p>I looked up the hospital and it turns out it&rsquo;s the same one where I
had my shoulder surgery done 9 years ago. (*)</p>

<p>So I pulled up <a href="https://surgery.robnugen.com">surgery.robnugen.com</a> (NSFL) and
discover that not only is it the same hospital; he&rsquo;s the surgeon who
did my surgery!</p>

<p>(*) Not only that; I got the recommendation 2 days ago, which is 9 years
(to the day) that I was discharged from the hospital.</p>

<h2 id="15-13">15:13</h2>

<p>I showed doc a couple of the photos from the surgery and it seems he
remembers.</p>

<p>I told him my elbow hurts and he pressed around a bit and I was like
&ldquo;yeah there&rdquo; and he goes okay, &ldquo;do this&rdquo; (make a fist and tilt wrist
back).  He held my arm to resist the motion as I did so and <em>boom</em>
pain. Yep that&rsquo;s the one!</p>

<p>Just got 2 X-rays taken, and I hope I&rsquo;ll be able to post them online. :-)</p>
