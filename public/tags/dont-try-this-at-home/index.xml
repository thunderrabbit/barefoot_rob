      <description>26 September 1998
Today I was frustrated (again) at my computer so I decided to go to Astroworld. I have a season pass and I&amp;rsquo;ve hardly used it; I think this is my 3rd time to go this season. (Strictly speaking I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten my money&amp;rsquo;s worth out of it, but only 3 times??)
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much tired as heck, so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this short.
I got there around 4pm and paid my 5 bucks to park.</description>
