      <description>16:56 Saturday 28 July 2018 JST We got to the beach around 10am and it was warm; by the time we left around 2pm it was hotter than I could stand to walk barefoot on the sand.
We ate at a vegetarian buffet https://yoganiigata.jp/ Good for 1600 yen per person.
23:24 Saturday 28 July 2018 JST We went to see Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom last night which was pretty good for a fifth installment of a series.</description>

      <description>14:28 Saturday 08 July 2017 JST While preparing to post my question to /r/emacs, the power went off in our house. The circuit breaker flipped. Lin&amp;rsquo;s AC and my computer + monitors are apparently on the same circuit, which seems weird, but I guess it was not the neighborhood losing power.
Oh, so while my computer battery is still fine, I cannot post the post while the router has no power.</description>
