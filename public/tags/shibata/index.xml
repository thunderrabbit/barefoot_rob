      <description>19:41 Tuesday 07 April 2015 JST Shibata-san and I went to the kebab place called King Kebab on 竹下通り in Harajuku. The shop is in a very girly area, coated in pink and hearts with hearthrob posters around the walls. We laughed about that; it&amp;rsquo;s almost embarrassing to be seen in there! haha
She asked about the science museum Miraikan and I said it was cool with lots of kids, but didn&amp;rsquo;t go in to detail about the exhibits.</description>

Shibata was hammering a chisel on something when I went in to the toy store today. She said she was &amp;ldquo;making sand&amp;rdquo;, which I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really disagree! She was chipping sand from a block of fake sandstone, which they had apparently made by mixing sand with some kind of glue.
I doubt it was made by Mother Nature because the sandstone had a plastic model of a dinosaur in it.</description>
