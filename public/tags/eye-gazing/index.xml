      <description>Today is the second time for me to lead an eye gazing workshop. This will be in the same location in Dogenzaka.
It will be my first time to meet Yuna face to face! We have been doing lessons online for a while (since July 2018), so we know each other pretty well, but we have never met!
Currently 4 people are scheduled to attend, which is better than the Past Lives workshop!</description>

      <description>In two weeks I will be leading an Eye Gazing Workshop near Shibuya station.
To help plan my first workshop, Rin asked me to choose something that made me really excited.
I told her I would have to think about it, and a couple days later it suddenly came to me as the perfect workshop.
After determining what I wanted the final outcome to be, the workshop plan went through a few iterations, with support from Georgie, Mark Wild, Soness, Kevin Turner, and others.</description>
