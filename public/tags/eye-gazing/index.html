                        <p>Today is the second time for me to lead an eye gazing workshop.  This
will be in the same location in Dogenzaka.</p>

<p>It will be my first time to meet Yuna face to face!  We have been
doing lessons online for a while (since July 2018), so we know each
other pretty well, but we have never met!</p>

<p>Currently 4 people are scheduled to attend, which is better than the
Past Lives workshop!  I apparently need to do a better job promoting
next time. :-)</p>

                        <p>In two weeks I will be leading an Eye Gazing Workshop near Shibuya
station.</p>

<p>To help plan my first workshop, Rin asked me to choose something that
made me really excited.</p>

<p>I told her I would have to think about it, and a couple days later it
suddenly came to me as the perfect workshop.</p>

<p>After determining what I wanted the final outcome to be, the workshop
plan went through a few iterations, with support from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/babay0ga/">Georgie</a>, Mark Wild,
<a href="https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/">Soness</a>, <a href="https://www.shamanism-asia.com/">Kevin Turner</a>, and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://concreteplayground.com/sydney/event/eye-gazing-2">Georgie has been doing eye gazing workshops for years in Australia.</a></p>

<pre><code>They say our eyes are the window to the soul.  This workshop will give
us a chance to look more deeply into ourselves and more deeply into
those around us.

The process is simple, and the results can be profound.  You may
discover parts about yourself that you didn't know where there.

In this workshop, we will be looking into the eyes of people that we
may never have met before.  We will have a chance to sit with multiple
participants, with a small break in between each person.

It's important to have an intention before each eye gazing practice,
so be sure to have some possible intentions in mind.  Some examples
might be

‚ÄúI intend to get to know myself better‚Äù
‚ÄúI intend to connect with my intuition‚Äù
‚ÄúI intend to practice acceptance of others‚Äù
‚ÄúI intend to practice acceptance of myself‚Äù

Let‚Äôs enjoy learning about ourselves and each other.
