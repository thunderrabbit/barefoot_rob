<p>I&rsquo;m on a bus!  I&rsquo;m on a bus!  Everyone, look at me; I&rsquo;m on a nearly
empty bus, headed to Narita, headed to Seattle to see Colleenie Bean
Dawg for a day doing touristy things in the city and then having pizza
at their crib.</p>

<p>(The bus is now waiting at a light like 5 minutes from my house.  So
funny how transit works on this planet.)</p>

<p>My friend wanted to buy a ticket to leave on Saturday and accidentally
bought a ticket that leaves at 00:01am (one minute after midnight)
Saturday morning. (26 hours from now as I write this)</p>

<p>I challenged him to write 25 benefits of such a situation.  Here are
mine:</p>

<ol>
<li>have a funny story</li>
<li>be awake with nothing to do but watch digital clock turn from 23:59:59 to 00:00:00</li>
<li>arrive at airport when it&rsquo;s relatively quiet</li>
<li>get a chance to see behind-the-scenes stuff they only do at night at airports</li>
<li>not have to wake up early for a flight</li>
<li>have already halfway solved the jetlag issue</li>
<li>get to really ponder the human construct of tracking time</li>
<li>have a chance to put a smile on face of staff working late</li>
<li>save time shopping for souvenirs</li>
<li>save money on buying souvenirs</li>
<li>have moving walkway all to yourself</li>
<li>get to wonder if other passengers made the same mistake</li>
<li>get to joke about how early the flight is</li>
<li>easy chance to sleep late on Saturday</li>
<li>no worries about a large choice of food vendors in airport</li>
<li>immediate night mode on plane so can sleep quickly</li>
<li>&ldquo;I leave tonight&rdquo; and &ldquo;I leave tomorrow&rdquo; are both true</li>
<li>passport stamps says you left the day before you actually leave</li>
<li>opportunity for taking nighttime photos at airport</li>
<li>can play in kids zone because no kids will be there</li>
<li>can say &ldquo;good evening&rdquo; to one seatmate immediately before &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; to next seatmate.</li>
<li>easily compare flight duration with length of day</li>
<li>get to board a plane wearing pajamas</li>
<li>get wonder when and wear the pilots slept</li>
<li>can say &ldquo;I remember getting on the plane like it was yesterday&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>The GoFundme text is not finished yet, but I plan to finish it up
tonight or tomorrow.</p>

<p>It took a while to get this version complete, including breaking a pen
and crying my eyes out with Mark at the Jonathan&rsquo;s near <ruby><rb>Âêë„É∂
‰∏òÈÅäÂúíÈßÖ</rb><rt><ruby><rb>„ÇÄ„Åì„ÅÜ„Åå„Åä„Åã„ÇÜ„ÅÜ„Åà„Çì„Åà„Åç
</rb><rt>mukogaokayuen station</rt></ruby></rt></ruby>.</p>

<p>Between working for TY and AB, I got this version complete in one
take, after about 30 takes over a period of a week or so.</p>

<p>Today while I was in the cafe below Muza, a woman came up and asked if
I could speak English.  I drew her a map to a bank on the other side
of the station, but had a slightly bad feeling about sending her on a
possible wild goose chase.  Her name is Dipika, and she&rsquo;s been in
Japan just a little bit and will be here for 2 more weeks.  She didn&rsquo;t
exchange currency at the airport so she had no yen to buy a ticket,
and they don&rsquo;t take credit cards.  She&rsquo;s interested in finance, and
asked me my thoughts on Bitcoin once I told her I did computer stuff.</p>

<p>She said she&rsquo;s interested in China for the financial possibilities,
and I definitely agree; it seems Chinese economy is on the rise.</p>

<p>Anyway, I walked with her to the bank &hellip;. and discovered only ATM
machines were there.  She needed to talk to a person.  I misremembered
what street had her bank so we walked to the wrong street for a
different bank and then we were like bah and just went to Shinagawa
station where she could exchange her voucher to get her JR Rail pass.</p>

<p>The staff there spoke English enough to help her find a mobile wifi
provider, so we went there and got her hooked up with wifi for two
weeks.  Once she got some cash exchanged in Shinagawa, she paid me
back for the train ticket to Shinagawa from Kawasaki.  I gave her the
money back in exchange for updates during her adventures.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping Dipika has a great trip!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m leaving in about an hour for a weekend in Portland.  It&rsquo;s for a
training called <em>The Container of Leadership</em>.  I will be challenged
to look deeply at myself, really digging down into my -isms and other
thoughts which unconsiously underly my perception of the world.</p>

<p>We arrived and went to the baggage claim but, fortunately thanks to
Lin checking first, we discovered we could <em>not</em> get our checked
baggage in Dubai when staying in hotels in the airport.</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s awesome: the guy was like beep beep beep and said our
baggage would be redirected to Haneda just like that boom. Automatic
scanners and stuff.  I know it&rsquo;s both amazing and meh, makes sense.
Also awesome: we thereby did not have to pay a fee for overweight bags
despite this airport allegedly being strict.</p>

<p>We had to go through security again, but I guess we couldn&rsquo;t get our
bags because they don&rsquo;t want us to escape into the city without visas,
which we don&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>Lin bought eyeliner during our 15+ minute walk to the hotel in
Concourse C, and is buying a T-shirt (and probably other stuff) now.
I showered and considered shaving but nah it can wait until we get
back.</p>

<p>I am certainly getting tired.  I did not sleep the last 4 hours of the
flight as planned.  I kept working on Godot and then watched the last
couple or three episodes of Lucifer season 2.</p>

<p>The flight was scheduled to be 14 hours, so I have been awake about 17
hours since my last entry.</p>

<p>Okay, yes I woke up at 20:47 and it is now 14:49 the next day.</p>

<p>So, call them 20 and 14, so actually 18 hours as of this entry.</p>

<p>It is 01:49 Monday 1 January 2018 in Tokyo, and I should be sleeping
soon, but I guess we won&rsquo;t sleep for 1.5 hours after we land, so about
2 hours from now.</p>

<p>I think we thought the flight leaves at 00:15, in which case we would
begin boarding in 20 minutes or so.  But it&rsquo;s at 01:15 so we have 80
minutes or so.</p>

<p>Lin is shopping for souvenirs though our bags are overweight, and will
apparently cost $100 in Dubai because *they are very strict there&rdquo;</p>
