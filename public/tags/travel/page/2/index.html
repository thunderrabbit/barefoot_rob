<p>We are going to get on the flight in several hours from now.  I wonder
when I will start to reverse my sleep schedule.  We are 11 hours
behind Tokyo, so not as far away as possible, but close.</p>

<p>I have just gotten out my computer (to work on ConSwi) when I realized
I should be sleeping.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I used the time to finish a big step in ConSwi.  Now
the player can win levels.</p>

<p>Lin and I just walked along the beach from the restaurante de
churrascos (sp) after pretty much gorging on all the offerings.</p>

<p>I saw some really neat rivulets on the beach (but forgot to take a
picture) where water seems to just spring from the beach.  I guess
that is exactly what&rsquo;s happening; water within the sand works its way
out and then comes down to the ocean.</p>

<p>Last night was my (and Lin&rsquo;s) first time to travel in an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380">Airbus A380</a>.  Our flight
was around 15 hours from Dubai to SÃ£o Paulo on Emirates, which is
apparently Airbus&rsquo; largest A380 customer.</p>

<p>I was impressed with how relatively quiet the plane was during the
entire flight.  (I had a window seat just at the trailing edge of the
wings.)</p>

<p>We had a hard landing with a bounce, but the aircraft came to a stop
very quickly and smoothly.</p>

<p>Wow we arrive in just 4 hours.  I tried to stay up longer by watching
a movie, but maybe I should have gotten out my computer.  I had had a
headache from being up so late so I didn&rsquo;t think I could program well.</p>

<p>I slept most of the flight already, it seems.  11 hour flight, 7 hours
down.</p>

<p>It is basically 8pm in our final destination, so I want to sleep again
soon.</p>

<p>My theory is that I switch my timezone to the destination time as soon
as I get on the plane.  We will be in Dubai just 2 hours so I skipped
that destination in my plan.</p>

<h2 id="20-48-thursday-14-december-2017-03">20:48 Thursday 14 December 2017 -03</h2>

<p>Okay I just switched the clock on my computer.  The &ldquo;-03&rdquo; looks weird
to me, but that&rsquo;s how emacs presented the timezone.</p>

<p>I shan&rsquo;t dig into it now; I want to work on Godot before bedtime.</p>

<h2 id="21-25-thursday-14-december-2017-03">21:25 Thursday 14 December 2017 -03</h2>

<p>Woah we have free wifi on this flight, it seems!</p>

<p>They give a free 20MB taster for 2 hours.  I shan&rsquo;t be watching cat
videos, but it&rsquo;s enough to check email.</p>

<p>It is <em>not</em> enough to push my journal repo more than a few times, so I
will refrain.</p>

<p>Though amazingly, we each have AC power available at each seat, it&rsquo;s a
bit cramped to have my computer on the tray table in front of me.  As
I type this, I&rsquo;m actually using my USB keyboard while it&rsquo;s on my legs
<em>under</em> the tray table.</p>

<p>Mouse motion is a bit cramped as well, so it&rsquo;s not a very good
environment for computin&rsquo;, but I figured I&rsquo;d give it a shot.  Lunch is being
served now.</p>

<p>2:51am Thursday 10 January 2013 as I write this. Â Just now about to go to bed after chatting with Lin a bit about the best way to get Ma and Fred to Shinagawa station. Â She wanted to rent a car to Shinagawa, but I think a simple taxi ride one way to Kawasaki will be faster and cheaper overall.</p>

<p>Chatted with Fred at the monthly apartment while he packed. Â When I Quit and Saved a Copy of the Minecraft Pocket Edition map from his phone to mine, the basement and one wall of our house was missing. Â  0.5.0 beta so I guess we came across a bonus bug. Â We considered saving the files directly, but I was like, &ldquo;nah it ain&rsquo;t worth it.&rdquo; Â You gotta pack and we gotta wake up and go to work/airport tomorrow.</p>

<p>I carried home the heater Paola and Jon gave to us. Â It&rsquo;s a liquid-filled radiator, so pretty heavy. Â I used the same plastic twine stuff: two lines each double looped around nice round parts of the heater and the longer one over my shoulder and the shorter one in my hand, both with padding from the toilet seat cover / lid cover that are coming home as well.</p>

<p>Paola and Jon had us all over for dinner today: lovely fresh salad, lovely yummy rice-shaped pasta with chicken, and incredible desserts from Taiwan. Â Paola had just gotten back from doing a vipassana course in Taiwan, which featured some food shopping after the course.</p>

<p>Today at work I was doing tests after <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14211281/how-to-daemonize-a-php-script-to-be-run-with-upstart">daemonizing the mailer</a>; I want to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t send double emails if multiple scripts are running at the same time. Â  But it sent several duplicate emails, moe joe.</p>

<p>Oh, and I came across <a href="https://thinkup.com">thinkup</a> today. Â I think I&rsquo;ll install it on my domain.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s making some small and big stretches in her life&hellip;Â  This Christmas she&rsquo;s making some gifts for family (instead of just buying stuff).Â Â Â  (that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m calling the small stretch.)</p>

<p>The big thing about which I&rsquo;m super impressed: she just applied for a new job &hellip;. in Thailand!!Â  Wow!Â  She&rsquo;s always wanted to travel, and I&rsquo;ve always said, &ldquo;so when are you going to do it???&ldquo;Â Â  I&rsquo;ve kept telling her, &ldquo;no you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> have to have X first,&rdquo; where X for Lin has usually been &ldquo;money&rdquo; or &hellip; I guess permission from her [self/family].</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s definitely got permission from me!Â  I look forward to visiting her in Bangkok, and taking her to see Chiang Mai!</p>

<p>Over our Christmas holidays, Lin and I went to San Francisco to see her uncle, and then to Texas to see my family and have a wedding ceremony on 30 December at Northwoods UU which was my church while I was in Texas growing up.</p>

<p>I hope to write more about the ceremony, but for now I want to archive this awesome picture of Johnny flying over the ________ in San Francisco.  I can&rsquo;t remember / find the name of the place..</p>

<p>Free hug if you know the name!!</p>
