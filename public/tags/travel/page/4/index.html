                        <p>##19:02 Sunday 20 November 2005</p>

<p>Hello world!</p>

<p>In the past couple weeks, I&rsquo;ve witnessed two and a half particularly interesting things.</p>

<p>1) One was the anti-climatic detonation of what turned out to be a fake grenade found by a Palestinian farmer near the olive trees we were helping him harvest.</p>

<p>He showed us the grenade, which looked real enough to warrant concern.  It had been partially buried with its pin removed, and two stones covering it.  The farmer thought the grenade may be live, planted as a landmine of sorts.</p>

<p>We called the Israeli Defense Force, who sent a couple of armored jeeps out the next day.  The soldiers placed a charge near the grenade with the intent of detonating the grenade via their remotely detonated charge.  We hid behind one of the jeeps when the charge was detonated.</p>

<p>A quick BAM, and some smoke; it was over.  The grenade had been a fake, they said.</p>

<p>I semi-jestfully apologized for &ldquo;making them come out&rdquo; though the grenade was fake.  One of the soldiers basically said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry; just doing our job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of us had to sign any papers, make any statements, or anything.  The soldiers packed up and left.  We inspected the small hole and dug for remains of the grenade, then left as well.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this should be a big deal.  There shouldn&rsquo;t be a nonchalant attitude about a grenade being found in a field.  They didn&rsquo;t ask us any questions; they didn&rsquo;t cordon off the area (except during their actual detonation); they didn&rsquo;t hunt for clues; they just came out, DESTROYED A GRENADE, and left.</p>

<p>There is a video of the detonation at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?v=xr3H_AlHPhU">https://www.youtube.com/?v=xr3H_AlHPhU</a>, and on my website with some pictures from the day at <a href="https://robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&date;=2005/10/31#Today">https://robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&date;=2005/10/31#Today</a></p>

<p>2) The second interesting thing happened quite close to the hostel where I&rsquo;m staying in Jerusalem.  Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not unusual that we hear soundbombs used near Damascus Gate, which is visible from the hostel&rsquo;s lounge window.  Soundbombs are not &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; per se, but the Israeli border police and soldiers use them to disperse crowds.</p>

<p>We heard a quick succession of perhaps 8 soundbombs, which sent several of us outside with video cameras to see what we could record.</p>

<p>I thought everything was over (I went out rather later than the others) when one last soundbomb was thrown.  I can only imagine the soldier who threw it must have been in an adrenaline-filled state, and not thinking clearly.  It landed quite near 4 or 5 young girls who had been walking up the road in a carefree way.</p>

<p>The video I took is here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?v=LVVGTnaNZns">https://www.youtube.com/?v=LVVGTnaNZns</a></p>

<p>Afterward, my friend David confronted someone who seemed to be in charge of the action, saying it was inappropriate to throw soundbombs so close to innocents.  This man angrily replied that rocks had been thrown at an innocent Jewish man, and that we Political Activists were only showing one side of the story; why weren&rsquo;t we videoing the Jew who had been hurt?</p>

<p>As I recorded David talking to the Jewish man (who had a bit of blood on his nose, not really visible in the video), the angry soldier yelled at me, but I didn&rsquo;t respond.</p>

<p>Here is the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?v=0vzUttSNzvU">https://www.youtube.com/?v=0vzUttSNzvU</a></p>

<p>3) The third thing happened yesterday.  I saw it from afar, but couldn&rsquo;t make myself go; it felt too dangerous.  A Palestinian family&rsquo;s house was being demolished for &ldquo;security reasons,&rdquo; according to the soldier who was asked.  The family had been given 24 hours notice.</p>

<p>My friends Juliet and Ben went to see what has happening.  Juliet had stones thrown at her by Palestinian kids when she was near the soldiers.  The video Juliet took features the wife wailing-crying-screaming at her life being destroyed before her eyes.  The Arab speakers here said she was blaming Ariel Sharon and others for her plight.  Juliet didn&rsquo;t record the husband screaming angrily at her, though people on the scene said he was yelling, &ldquo;why couldn&rsquo;t you come earlier?  Why are you here now [that it&rsquo;s too late]?  Why didn&rsquo;t you stop this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben wrote</p>

<p>Last Monday I went on a tour of East Jerusalem with an Israeli
Jewish group called ICAHD (Israeli Committee Against Housing
Demolitions).  On the way home our guide received a text alert on
his phone about a house demolition in the West Bank town of Anata
that was about to occur.  We could see from the highway across the
valley two large excavators with hydraulic hammer attachments
surrounded by soldiers pushing back a crowd.  We couldn&rsquo;t tell
which building it was that was going to be demolished.  Only three
of us were willing to go and witness this, so we were dropped off
up the highway at the entrance to the town and rushed to the site
where the demolition was already under way.  There were 20-30
children on the road, some throwing stones at the soldiers
standing guard, a hundred Palestinians with soldiers blocking them
encircling the entire site, and just as many on rooftops.  I split
up from the other two and headed to the uphill side of the
building to get a good perspective.* It was a three story
apartment building and it took about an hour for the machines to
knock the whole thing down.</p>

<p>The two excavators made a terrible noise as the two hydraulic
hammers slammed the concrete and sections of the floor suddenly
gave way.  As it started to get dark I decided it would be a good
idea to get home, and as I walked back through the streets it
occurred to me that the three of us were the only internationals
I&rsquo;d seen.  It seems to me now that one advantage to the
authorities of not issuing warning of the demolition is that this
most likely prevents any international media from being there.
And there wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t go; it sounds really traumatizing.</p>

<p>4) After my last email, I got a few replies that asked some of the same questions.</p>

<p>*) I forgot to specify that a stone had hit me, not a rubber bullet.</p>

<p>*) I described Palestine as &ldquo;a country basically surrounded by Israel.&rdquo;  A better description would be &ldquo;Occupied Territories of Palestine,&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s not a country as such, and it&rsquo;s not surrounded.</p>

<p>5) Over the past two days I have been practicing peace within myself via meditation, reading (<em>Life of Pi</em>), writing, and folding origami.  I&rsquo;ve been releasing the ingrained ideas that I need to be &ldquo;doing something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>6) However, yesterday, Ben, Dave and I went to the Dead Sea and had a fantastic time!  We went to En Gedi Beach, which is free (except for transportation out there) if one brings food.  We delighted in the incredible buoyancy and decided we could easily swim to Jordan.  If we became tired on the way, we could simply rest, floating effortlessly with our heads well out of the water.</p>

<p>After our swim, we met a woman named Delphine from Switzerland and chatted with her while I let the water dry on my skin, leaving a layer of salt crystals on my shoulder and some in my beard.  (I haven&rsquo;t shaved since I left Japan on 6 October.)  We decided to take a mud bath, and turned ourselves into mud versions of The Fantastic Four, or a dark hue of Blue Man Group.  I debated letting Francois (my stuffed rabbit) get coated, but didn&rsquo;t want to risk having him rot if I couldn&rsquo;t wash all the mud out.</p>

<p>Several pictures from Dead Sea and a longer version of the story are here:
<a href="https://robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&date;=2005/11/14">https://robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&date;=2005/11/14</a></p>

<p>7) Just tonight, I went to Bethlehem with my friend Niveen!!  We had some problems getting through the new checkpoint, a brand new facility that opened yesterday according to my friend Sarah who has been going to and from Bethlehem almost every day during her stay in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Niveen was disallowed to drive through, causing her great consternation and a U-turn with no idea how we could get in.  We jumped onto a servis (group taxi), hoping they could get through.  Actually they could not, but dropped us off at the walk-in gate, outside a brand new facility that looks a lot like a modernized cattle-herding hanger.  We were monitored by soldiers on ramparts, blocked by rotating gates (that were remotely locked after a few people went through), required to show our IDs to people behind thick (bullet proof?) glass, where Niveen (and all other Palestinians) will have their IDs entered into a computer.</p>

<p>There were several people in line, and one guy said he knew a shortcut, which turned out to be walking through the drive-through gate where we had been stopped before.  I just walked through without acknowledging the guards until they used English and Niveen called my name.  I still didn&rsquo;t show them my ID but stood there &ldquo;impatiently&rdquo; waiting for Niveen who pleaded her case until finally we were waived through.</p>

<p>We walked through the massive gate in the wall (big enough for tour buses) and quickly found a servis to take us to Bethlehem University (where Niveen went to school).  We saw some of her friends (and one of mine!) and then visited the Church of the Nativity, where I got a picture of Francois on the site where Jesus is said to have been born.</p>

<p>This was all great and fantastic and I was really happy to get this crown jewel of a Francois photo (though Sarah says I should have put him <em>in</em> the hole) before I left for home.</p>

<p>On the way back through the checkpoint, I was astonished that all the passengers on tour buses had to get OUT of the tour bus, wait in the spanking new cattle herding facility, then get back ON the tour bus, for a grand total of moving about 100 yards in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>We waited in line, chatting with several other Americans who were on a tour, and marveled at the facility.  It&rsquo;s literally like going between countries, not between cities.  I stood in line with Niveen, whereas passport holders could just show their passport and walk through a gate (so I don&rsquo;t know what was taking so long at first).  In a non-violent act against the facility, I tried to walk through the gate, found it locked, so I jumped over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned around after a couple of &ldquo;heys&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo; like &ldquo;who are you to talk to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guy was like &ldquo;where&rsquo;s your passport?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked him in the eyes.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way am I showing you my passport.  My taxes <em>paid</em> for this facility (*)&rdquo; I glared into his eyes until he grabbed my arm as if to show me who was boss.</p>

<p>I pulled away and was like, &ldquo;alright, look,&rdquo; and showed him my passport.  He took it and I tried to snatch it back from him and then pulled his arm and he looked back at me like, &ldquo;are you daring to challenge my authority?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I backed off and he gave my passport to the guy behind the glass.</p>

<p>I said something like, &ldquo;this is ridiculous; there&rsquo;s no reason to make these people wait here; this is completely preposterous,&rdquo; by which time my passport was checked and put back under the glass where the guy I had challenged motioned toward it with his head, ignoring everything I said.</p>

<p>This is definitely a situation after which I thought of several things I could have said better at the moment.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure I would not have done it had there <em>not</em> been about 50 American tourists there watching everything.  I basically just wanted to make a scene and get across the point that the checkpoint makes people resentful.</p>

<p>Pictures are on this page, though not (yet) well labeled:

<p>(*) strictly speaking I can&rsquo;t prove this is true, but I know the US gives money to Israel.</p>

<p>8) I&rsquo;ll be leaving this area on the 17th, and back in Japan the next day.</p>

<p>Love and Blessings to All!

                        <p>##04:53 Saturday 29 October 2005</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to write a few lines about what I&rsquo;ve seen in the West Bank, though I have not actually picked olives yet.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this will be a long message, so I&rsquo;m going to write it in sections, and may follow up with other sections soon.</p>

<p>=======================
Section One: Vocabulary</p>

<p>When I first arrived here, I did not know the meaning / differences between &ldquo;West Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gaza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following are my definitions, and people may disagree with them.</p>

<p>Israel: a small country between the Mediterranean Sea on the west and Jordan on the east.</p>

<p>Palestine: an even smaller country that is basically surrounded by Israel.  Palestine is basically separated into two parts.  The parts are &ldquo;West Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gaza&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Gaza Strip&rdquo;).</p>

<p>West Bank: the larger section of Palestine, which is on the west bank of the Jordan river.  Hence the name, I believe.</p>

<p>Gaza: the smaller section of Palestine, on the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>Occupation: Israeli soldiers with M-16 (?) machine guns are ever-present in Palestine streets (and possibly Israel, but I haven&rsquo;t been there).  In my experience, they are generally quiet, but will answer questions if I ask.  Often they say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I&rsquo;m not from this area.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Checkpoints: Blockade or toll-plaza type places in the streets and highways where traffic is stopped and checked by Israeli soldiers. Some checkpoints completely disallow vehicular traffic from passing. (*) see Qalandia Checkpoint below.</p>

<p>Flying Checkpoints: same as checkpoints, but erected on the whim of the Israeli army.  I have seen these on highways, on sidewalks, on city streets.</p>

<p>Settlers: Israeli citizens who (often for financial reasons) are given housing from the Israeli government.  They are placed in areas that would otherwise be called Palestine (according to my definition above).  I have not met any settlers, but have heard some horrific stories of unchecked settler aggression toward Palestinians and Internationals.</p>

<p>Internationals: people who are not from Israel or Palestine, but who would like to help stop the occupation of Palestine.</p>

<p>Olive Harvest: &lsquo;tis the season farmers pick olives from trees. Sometimes settlers challenge Palestinian farmers for rights to the land.  When Internationals are present with video cameras, settlers seem less likely to be violent.</p>

<p>Refugee Camps: poor, cramped cities where displaced Palestinians have been moved when Israel was formed, or more recently as Israel has grown into previously Palestinian areas.</p>

<p>Apartheid: unequal application of rules / laws to racially separate people.  From South Africa, but has been used to describe the situation in Israel/Palestine.</p>

<p>Security Fence:
Separation Barrier:
Apartheid Wall:  a fence / wall 8 meters tall being constructed around Palestine.</p>

<p>further reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid_wall">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid_wall</a></p>

<p>Intifada: An uprising of Palestinians against the apartheid in which they have been living.  The first Intifada was from 1987 to 1992ish. The second Intifada started in 2000, and is or is not finished depending on who one asks.</p>

<p>=================================
Section Two:  Qalandia Checkpoint</p>

<p>I have been living in Faisal Hostel in Jerusalem.  It&rsquo;s near the Old City of Jerusalem, where Jesus carried the cross before his crucifixion back in the day.</p>

<p>Ramallah is a city about 18 kilometers (11 miles) north of Jerusalem. Ramallah means hill of God.</p>

<p>There is a highway between Ramallah and Jerusalem, which would make the trip take about 15 minutes by car.</p>

<p>However, there is a checkpoint on the highway, through which vehicles may not pass.</p>

<p>To go from Jerusalem to Ramallah, everyone must get out of the vehicle (taxi or bus, unless someone has a friend to drive their personal car away) walk 100 meters past guards and through a one way gate, then secure another vehicle to go the remaining 5 minutes to Ramallah.</p>

<p>To get from Ramallah to Jerusalem, everyone must get out of the vehicle, walk 50 meters, go through a one way gate, through a metal detector, show passport or ID to the soldiers, and then the remaining 50 meters to secure another vehicle on the other side.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s called Qalandia Checkpoint, and rumor has suggested the security could get even tighter on the way from Jerusalem to Ramallah.</p>

<p>==================
Section Three: ISM</p>

<p>ISM stands for International Solidarity Movement.  Their basic idea involves having Internationals come to Palestine to stand with Palestinians during the riotous Intifada.  Because the Intifada is no longer riotous, and many &ldquo;hard core&rdquo; ISMers have been blacklisted and cannot return to the country, ISM will reformulate itself after this year&rsquo;s olive harvest.</p>

<p>I came to Palestine with the intention of joining other ISMers in supporting the olive harvest.  At the training, I was surprised at the content of the training.  We spent a great deal of time on topics like protecting ourselves from tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound bombs. We did role plays of de-arresting people by dogpiling a person the soldiers are trying to arrest.  We spent a great deal of time learning about our rights and about the chances of being arrested, what to expect, and what to do in case we are arrested.</p>

<p>At the end, we came to the final question: &ldquo;okay, where do you want to go harvest olives?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I decided I was not ready to put myself into a situation where I might be arrested.  More specifically, I didn&rsquo;t want to be deported without the chance of return.</p>

<p>================================
Section Four: Palestinian Vision</p>

<p>Instead of being an Activist, I have focused on being a writer.  Part of that time has been writing and editing reports and grant requests for Palestinian Vision, an NGO that focuses on empowering Palestinian Youth to help them focus on living instead of being oppressed.</p>

<p>I learned of PalVision semi-directly from my voyage on Peace Boat. Niveen and Eilat were selected by PalVision to sail on Peace Boat and represent youth voices in this conflict.  Niveen&rsquo;s passionate story brought me to Palestine to see for myself what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>====================
Section Five: Bil&rsquo;in</p>

<p>Residents of a village called Bil&rsquo;in gather every Friday (the first day of their weekend) to peacefully protest construction of a wall that (once completed) will separate the village from 60% of its farmland, which will be given to the nearby Israeli settlement.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been to this demonstration twice, not as an active participant, but as a photographer and videographer.  Each week, approximately the same thing happened: soldiers stood in full riot gear at the top of a hill while villagers and at least as many internationals chanted in Arabic and held signs.  I was one of many recording the event, basically ignored by everyone involved.</p>

<p>After the chanting, the demonstration splits up into people who go home, and people who spread out over the land.  The soldiers spread out with them.  Some people (who may be a villagers or may be Israeli sympathetic and trying to stir up trouble) throw rocks at the soldiers who wait for a bit and then shoot rubber bullets and tear gas at the rock throwers.</p>

<p>The first time I attended (two weeks ago), I tried to stay well away from the conflict, but at one point found myself right in the middle of it!  Unfortunately with dead batteries in both my still camera and video camera because I had recorded so much other stuff.  I wasn&rsquo;t hit by anything, but I did get a couple long moments with tear gas.</p>

<p>The second time I attended (last week), I recorded some of the action, and then honestly got rather bored and just sat near the top of the hill near where some soldiers were standing around waiting for instruction.</p>

<p>Suddenly, <em>!<em>WHAM</em>!</em> I felt a shocking blow on my shoulder!  It was more surprising than painful, but had it hit <em>anywhere</em> else on my body, it would have produced serious pain and likely injury.  It struck exactly on the muscle between my neck and shoulder.  Truly thankful, truly blessed, I thanked my angels for the easy lesson.</p>

<p>(it was a stone)</p>

<p>Several soldiers came to ask if I was okay; I assured everyone I was fine.</p>

<p>The week before, a man named Joe was hit by a stone in the stomach. Palestinian doctors repaired his spleen and stapled the incision shut on his abdomen.  He is sitting across from me and showed everyone his scar - about five inches long.</p>

<p>====================</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s enough for one installment.  Blessings and love to all.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in Jerusalem!</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t really seen anything undeniably inappropriate, but there is definitely a distinction between areas for Palestinians and  areas for Israelis, and definitely some weird stuff going on.</p>

<p>For the past two days, I&rsquo;ve been staying in Faisal Hostel, basically across the street from Damascus Gate, a portal between the Old City of Jerusalem, and the rest of Jerusalem.  The Old City is where a lot of biblical stories took place, including where Jesus was tortured and paraded through town, if I understand correctly.</p>

<p>Twice I&rsquo;ve wandered around the Old City, which seems a lot like the world&rsquo;s original shopping mall, but with churches and people with machine guns keeping us in line.</p>

<p>Once I wandered around a market in an Israeli area of town, where I was surprised to see a significant number of civilians with guns tucked into their belts.  What type of bizarro world have I reached??</p>

<p>This month the muslims are celebrating Ramadan, and last night the Israeli soldiers were 2500 strong around the Old City, controlling entrance where people were trying to go pray.  At one point the soldiers launched sound bombs to disperse the crowd that had collected near Damascus Gate.   The Palestinians hadn&rsquo;t been doing anything violent.  I had just been out there getting some food.</p>

<p>Today my friend Niveen (from Peace Boat) came to visit, and gave me her old cell phone!  She took me to get a simcard and then to the Palestinian Vision office where I met Ramy, the Middle East Coordinator for Peace Boat!  He speaks 100 miles per hour and invited me to come by anytime I&rsquo;d like to help with writing or editing.  Fantastic numbers of doors are opening for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll stick with my original plan for now; I&rsquo;m going to be trained tomorrow and the next day by people from ISM before participating in the olive harvest.  Ramy assured me that 1 month is far too long for me to pick olives every day, and said I&rsquo;d be welcome back whenever I was done picking olives.</p>

<p>So so much to learn; so many people I&rsquo;ll be meeting tomorrow!</p>

                        <p>##02:18 Tuesday 19 July 2005</p>

<p>We 16 GET Teachers (GET stands for Global English/Espanol Training) all teach two classes a day on 35 days of the voyage.  During our free time we have the option of being quite busy with lectures and myriad activities on the ship.  (( One of the biggest &ldquo;problems&rdquo; on the ship is deciding what to do next!  Every room usually teems with activity. ))  Somewhere during all that (usually at night when we&rsquo;ve got several hours before classes) we plan lessons, with each teacher designing his or her own curriculum to fit the students and hopefully coordinate with the ports we&rsquo;re visiting, etc.  One basic philosophy allows the students to immediately use the English they&rsquo;re learning.</p>

<p>GET Teachers and CCs (Communication Coordinators (translators)) room together, separated by gender, with usually 3 or 4 people per room.  We&rsquo;re on the 3rd floor of the ship, the lowest level for passengers, with only crew below us.</p>

<p>Right next to my room is a Water Tight Door.  Every night it closes around 11pm and opens around 6am.   Its loud clanging rumble no longer wakes me, but simply gives me a general gauge of how much longer I can sleep.  I have a plan to stick a piece of cardboard in as it shuts to see what happens, but so far this plan hasn&rsquo;t been executed.</p>

<p>Very close to my room are stairs (and elevator) which connect all the floors, and in about 10 seconds I can leave my room and arrive on the 4th floor in the dining room called Topaz Dining.  This dining room usually serves buffet style meals in the morning and set meals for lunch and dinner.  During the set meals, we must arrive within a 20 minute &ldquo;seating window&rdquo; to make things simpler for the cooks and wait staff who really work hard to provide excellent customer service.  All the waitstaff can speak English and Japanese (at least the niceties) and their own languages.  I have learned Good Morning and Thank You in Bulgarian, Thank You in Chinese and Filipino (though I already knew the Chinese version), and I try to use the correct words depending on who is serving our table.</p>

<p>On the 5th floor is GET Street, the name of the hallway which contains 10 classrooms where we teach our lessons.  Basically there are 30 English classes a day, with each teacher teaching 2 classes.  (Adriana teaches Spanish.)  I am in GET Room 9 from 8am to 9:25am and then GET Room 4 from 9:30am to 10:55am.  A computer in each room (new for this voyage!) allows us to use multimedia during our lessons: powerpoint, music, movies, etc.  I also use it to take notes and define vocabulary words for the students and give them a printout after the classes.  The rest of 5th floor is filled with passenger rooms.  And the infirmary.</p>

<p>In addition to many rooms, on the sixth floor (but on the other end of the ship) is the GET Office where, last cruise, all the lesson planning was done.  I can&rsquo;t really imagine what it must have been like for 15 teachers all vying for time on two old PCs with a single printer and cranky copy machine.   This voyage seems to be like a transition, as some things are still done in the GET Office, but most things are being done down on GET Street.  Also on the 6th floor is Reception, next to which we usually dis/embark the ship.  Reception is staffed 24 hours and basically works like a hotel reception desk.</p>

<p>On the 7th floor most of the daily Peace Boat activity takes place.  Broadway is a large meeting room that spans the back of the ship.  Lectures happen there during the day and performances at night.  A theater is next up from Broadway where they play ping pong during the day and various movies at night.  I haven&rsquo;t played ping pong nor watched any movies there.  After that are some storage rooms and then Peace Center, which seems to be staffed 24 hours, by diligent workers who produce the daily schedule in Japanese and English and the daily paper with ship news.</p>

<p>The schedule is a monstrosity in itself, with nearly every minute of every room filled.  The schedule is quite dynamic; people come up with new activities they want to do and vie for time in various rooms.  The English schedule is usually quite entertaining with misspellings and funny translations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s 1970!&rdquo;  or &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s 21 years old!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s learning Korean drum!&rdquo;  or &ldquo;Sawing Circle&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bleak Dancing&rdquo;  &ldquo;Frag Semaphore&rdquo;  (the last two being R-L mixups) &ldquo;Scream out the name of the person you love&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next on the ship is the Free Space, next to Hemingway Bar (a piano bar).  Then there is Winjammer Lounge (variously spelled with or without a D) which is nearly as wide as the ship save for a hallway on each side.  A small gameroom and meeting room are past Windjammer, and then several nice passenger rooms.</p>

<p>The 8th floor is outside: basically the deck around the perimeter of the ship, and sports deck (above Winjammer, which sometimes gives stomp-enhanced lectures) and then a small room called T-Club next to the small weight gym), then the front deck (where we are not allowed to jump because passengers may be sleeping below).  The back of the ship on 8th floor is an always-buffet dining area called Yacht Club during the day and a Japanese style bar at night.</p>

<p>The 9th deck is near the center of the ship.  It&rsquo;s called the pool deck because &hellip;&hellip; there are two pools and a jacuzzi available when we&rsquo;re in the middle of the ocean.  The water is pulled straight up from the ocean, so it&rsquo;s the same temperature as what the fish are experiencing.</p>

<p>Next to the pool deck is Sunshine Bar, an outdoor bar by the pool.  This bar is not as popular as the others, but people often spend a little quiet time there.</p>

                        <p>##05:33 Saturday 02 July 2005</p>

<p>Hello from Le Havre, France!  This city of 100,000 features some museums and gardens, and old architecture that I can&rsquo;t name, but reminds me of old paintings.  I&rsquo;ve written more detail about our Le Havre wanderings in my journal dated July 2nd.</p>

<p>I think the last time I wrote was in Egypt (Port Said) after we saw the three Great Pyramids and Sphinx in Cairo.</p>

<p>After that, we landed in Piraeus, Greece, which was a short train ride to Athens, where I walked around alone.  I was pretty much not in the mood for chatting, though I can&rsquo;t remember specifically why.  It was probably related to issues regarding plans in Jamaica&hellip; but that is a different story.
In Athens, after visiting an old church (by &lsquo;old&rsquo; I mean 2500 years, and by &lsquo;church&rsquo; I mean rubble strewn remains of walls) where I was not allowed to take a picture of Francois sitting on the wall, I padded barefootedly around the Acropolis entrance and the Parthenon (I think) though I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to enter either without shoes.</p>

<p>I can basically understand the reason (that I heard later via rumor): the modern Greek culture desires that the ancient greek ruins be treated with reverence and respect.  No climbing, funny faces, bare feet, stuffed animals.  These are 2000+ year old works of art.  Not part of some large playground.</p>

<p>Instead of putting on shoes, I ate ice cream and wrote post cards next to a little kiosk where I had seen a rather large turtle trapped behind a fence designed to keep me out of the Acropolis (not, I imagine, designed to keep turtles in).  I took a picture of him with Francois in the foreground.  Had there been no other people around, I would have put Francois on the turtle, and then later may have regretted my decision had the turtle become frightened by my antics.</p>

<p>I felt quite better after my day alone in Athens, and after eating another ice cream.</p>

<p>Interesting things in Athens:</p>

<p>1) while sitting outside the train station, I saw two dogs running loose in the street, inadvertantly scaring pigeons and basically being happy dogs.  They ran inside the train station, barked for a bit and ran back out and down the street.</p>

<p>2) the train stations don&rsquo;t force people to buy tickets.  Bypassing the gates is a trivial matter; I don&rsquo;t know if there is some hidden enforcement that I didn&rsquo;t see.</p>

<p>3) while walking back to the boat, I saw some men with an extremely efficient way of towing illegally parked cars.  They simply remove the license plates and put a ticket on the windshield.  Granted, this can&rsquo;t really be called towing, but it achieves the same purpose.  The car owner must proceed immediately to the license plate retrieval location and pay a fine to get the plates back.</p>

<hr />

<p>In Italy, we landed on Sciliy in Catania.  From there, I walked around with Niveen, a Palestinian student who has been onboard with Elait, an Israeli student since Jordan.  ((They&rsquo;ve been telling us the horrors of the Israeli occupation in Palestine: 8 meter wall being built through villages; random checkpoints within the city with rules that change daily, forcing people to lose hours of time every day; propoganda from the Israeli government saying &ldquo;We need the wall for security against these attacks,&rdquo; when the truth is the attacks are due to the wall and the occupation itself.))</p>

<p>After wandering around the Catania fish market, ogling the huge variety of fish, eating gelati and pizza and various fruits, we convened with Audrey, Allison, Natalie, et. al. near an outdoor clothing market and chowed fresh large red and green peppers stuffed with cheese and basil and olives.  Super thanks to Audrey for expanding my brain to a new way of eating a cheap, simple, healthy, delicious meal!</p>

<p>Our group took a train to Taormina, which had been accurately described as a beautiful spot to visit.  The view from the top of the hill can be augmented with pay-binoculars for a close up view of the crystal waters and surrounding hills facing the sea.</p>

<p>We had to hurry back, so we took a taxi.  But that put us far enough ahead of schedule that we were able to stop by the beach (I&rsquo;ll recognize the name if you say it) for about 10 minutes.  The water looked clear enough to drink (though I assure you it&rsquo;s too salty to drink much) and was too cold for me to do more than wade.</p>

<hr />

<p>In Barcelona, we arrived on a Sunday, which also happened to be a national holiday.  Most of the shops were closed, but La Rambla and the main tourist places were still active.  On La Rambla, a street of kiosks and street performers, I was impressed by the ability of a man dressed like the devil: he could leap out of his box and stand on top of it for a photo, then collapse as if falling back into his box.  I was unimpressed, however, with his manners.  After seeing a couple of people come up to him for pictures, I went up and he was like, &ldquo;go away&rdquo; and then he yelled at all the onlookers &ldquo;go away!  move on!&rdquo;&hellip;  it was really strange, and I can&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;s part of his act.  I didn&rsquo;t give him any money.</p>

<p>Niveen and I saw the Sagrada Familia (sp) and cliimbed its 340+ steps to peer over the edges of its spiraling towers and see the continuing construction.  The church is really beautiful in its ugliness, and I must give props to the original architect for his vision.  I enjoyed running down the tight spiral steps, because it could definitely be described as dangerous, and it made me dizzy.  There is no handrail in the center: just a vertical column of a hole about a foot wide.</p>

<p>Niveen and I visited Park Guell, another fair climb to the top of its hill, though escalators are available.  (I didn&rsquo;t use them.)  From the park, the view of the city featured Sagrada Familia nestled within the smaller buildings, all surrounded by mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>We chatted about life, specifically her plans for the future and my lack of plans for the future.</p>

<hr />

<p>In Le Havre, France, I am sitting now on the top deck of our ship on Sunshine Bar.  This place will come alive again in about 7 hours, when people crowd the sides of the boat for the departure ceremony.  Next stop: Norway!</p>

<p>Not just Sri Lanka, but Columbo, which is the largest city (though not the capital) in this beautiful friendly country.  The people are as friendly as in Vietnam, and the traffic is about as crazy, but with more trucks and 3-wheelers (little three wheel trucks they use as taxis).</p>

<p>The homes here are often covered in corrugated sheet metal, with patchwork quilt appearance from above.  We got a tour through a university (possibly named Kabilla) and it started raining (we&rsquo;re in monsoon season now) so little red muddy rivers formed between the trees.  We got to do some drumming with cool drumsticks with rings for the mallet part that give a good springy feel and a nice clear drum cadence.</p>

<pre><code>==========--------.=.
                 /   \
                |     |   &lt; --- hollow ring
                 \___/
</code></pre>

<p>The next &lsquo;workshop&rsquo; type thing was dancing, and we learned dance moves with really long names like &ldquo;tagatondata&rdquo; and &ldquo;wakaranakatta&rdquo; which we had seen before in a cool performance that I got on video (though from an oblique angle), with awesome dance moves involving legs and arms, and quite stable torso.  I really got into the dancing and got all sweaty as had the dancers.  I&rsquo;m really glad to have several new types of moves to add to my Rob&rsquo;s Crazy Dance.  Looking forward to throwing down some new moves at the next party!</p>

<p>We loaded into busses and rolled to a nice hotel with all male waitstaff in the dining area.  I actually only saw one female working there; she was working at the entrance like behind the reception counter.  Talking to some of the students who joined us from the university, I learned that parents are pretty strict with when their kids can go out.  There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;dating&rsquo; as we have in the US.  Arranged marriages are on the decline, but still common enough that they have a name for the others: &ldquo;love marriages.&rdquo;  All the women at our table were proponents of love marriage.</p>

<p>I sat next to Kapila, a professor of Russian on campus, who is the leader of the dance troup called NATANDA.  His muscle tone is fabulous; I was ready to play ball for the other team after seeing his arms!  Oh my gosh.  He knows at least three languages: Russian, English and Singalese.  Eranjala, who sat on my left knows Japanese, German, English and Sinhalese.  Wow wow wow.  I&rsquo;m wondering if I can catch up and become fluent in a few languages.  I&rsquo;ll have to work harder than I have been.</p>

<p>The dinner was lovely; various types of curry and two types of rice.  Then a cool bowl of rice, and by that I mean a bowl made out of rice-flour batter cooked in a bowl shape.  So much potential for cereal, hats, pitas, and even curry.  Dessert included a fruit salad and some kind of yummy mushy brownies and some sweet yummy custardy tapioca, plus treacle (&ldquo;tree-kul&rdquo;) a white blubbery yummy delight made with honey from a tree.</p>

<hr />

<p>The GET students did presentations on yukatas and tea ceremony and bon odori (a traditional Japanese dance).  I particularly enjoyed the tea ceremony one because I helped Suzuko write her speech before she presented the ceremony.  Most interesting is that it took three minutes for her to prepare a bowl of tea. A real tea ceremony takes two or three <em>hours</em>, and includes preparing the meal before the tea.</p>

<hr />

<p>Recently on the boat, things have settled from a hectic busy chaotic state to a busy state.  We&rsquo;ve come into a stabilized schedule and actually have a day off tomorrow.  (We have days off from teaching while in ports and the days after most ports.)</p>

<p>Last night was the last night we got to see Kamau, a hip hop artist from San Francisco who now lives in Bali. He has been presenting a workshop on poetry for the few weeks he&rsquo;s been onboard.  The passengers had an open mic night last night, and some of them wrote poems honoring his work.  Pretty fun.  He performed a rap-poem called Lone Gunman, which is raw and wild, describing the days he broke away from his crew to do his own thing: they were still into the drug scene and he was working hard to produce some records.  I recorded it; I didn&rsquo;t get his permission to transcribe it though.</p>

<hr />

<p>My underwater camera case has been a good investment.  We&rsquo;ve not gone diving, but even just in the pool we&rsquo;ve had lots of fun taking silly pictures and video of our antics.  When taking video, the sounds are quite clear. fun stuff!</p>

<hr />

<p>My GET classes (each GET teacher has two classes) are bonding nicely.  At 9:30am I meet with Cheerful Dancing Fellows, and we went up for drinks a couple nights ago in Hemmingway Bar.  Last night I met with my 12:30pm class, Happy Wonderful Girls, and I was happy to play a wonderful game of Silent Football with them!  I am honestly surprised with how quickly they picked up the game, and am really looking forward to getting some more games going with more people and more errors upon which to tattle.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve recorded 4.25 cassette tapes worth of stuff; I think each tape is 120 minutes long.  One is nearly filled with conversations, including one with LeLy Hayslip, author of Heaven and Earth, which was made into a movie by Oliver Stone.  After getting herself started with the book and movie, she has started a foundation and opened orphanages and hospitals..  and all this in only 20 years.  I feel inspired that I can do great things, though I still don&rsquo;t know what I want to do yet.</p>

<p>Vietnam has been the best stop so far (Hong Kong, Danang, Singapore).  People were friendly, roads were bumpy and chaotic, little 8 to 12 year old kids hardselling postcards, silk things, tiger balm, .. anything they could carry around.  I must say they were quite well practiced with quick lines and little pouty faces that could wrench money from the coldest heart.</p>

<p>I bought custom made sandals for 95,000 d. (about US$7) and I love them. There&rsquo;s nothing to them, just leather on rubber soles and blue leather straps, but they&rsquo;re just my size and quite comfy.</p>

<p>Some of the girls were fitted for dresses, and Shawn got himself a white linen suit, and a brown linen shirt.  He said one of his life goals was to own a white linen suit; I look forward to seeing him in it!  (I can imagine Fred wearing it to the next nin concert he attends!)</p>

<p>In Vietnam, we visited a school which was built using funds from one of the previous Peace Boat fundraising campaigns.  Two rooms with blackboards and desks, plus another building about the same size, though I don&rsquo;t know what was in it.  Most impressive at that ceremony was how well behaved the kids were!  Lined up on the sidewalk, squatting and waiting for over an hour in the hot sun for what must have been a boring school-opening ceremony&hellip; without complaint! I was completely impressed and amazed at their remarkably good behavior!</p>

<p>After the ceremony, GET teachers visited the classrooms and had a spontaneous lesson in each room: greetings in one and &ldquo;head shoulders knees and toes&rdquo; sung in the other.  After that, we chowed lovely delicious fresh fruit and for the first time I had something called michi (in Vietnamese, I think) or jackfruit in English. Maryann suggested that it looks like yellow peppers, which seems more accurate that banana peels, which is what I suggested.  The teachers seemed well-divided between love and hate on the jackfruit debate.  I joined the love team and chowed probably 6 of them.  (on top of the pineapple slices and some of the little fruits that janette and I encountered in Hawaii).</p>

<p>A river was discovered nearby the school and Greg went for a swim.. the rest of us cheered him on and a couple people waded.  I monitored my brainwaves&rsquo; disgust at the motorboat (engine enclosed in a wooden box on a mere large wooden canoe of a boat) being used to ferry people and bicycles across while people swam in the murky water, plus a woman on the side washing her fresh vegetables (leafy greens) in the water.  Memories of Carla&rsquo;s adventure along the Ganges in India make my story a well-cleansed hospital in comparison, but still.  Eww.</p>

<p>That night we got a hotel for US$4 per person, and we each got our own double bed!  Fun wandering around Hoi An again and I went to be early so I could have more of a day to myself the next day.</p>

<p>I woke up early and went to see Tam and asked her to get me a motorbike driver for the day.  We negotiated a bit to get me a good price that included going back to the ship (near Danang in Tien Sa).  Basically US$6 for all that.  Not sure if it&rsquo;s the best price ever, but I was certainly happy with the arrangement.</p>

<p>Ninh (pronounced somewhere between &ldquo;nun&rdquo; and &ldquo;non&rdquo;), my driver, couldn&rsquo;t speak a lot of English, but we got around fine: he took me to a nearly private beach where I indulged myself with a foot massage, mango shake and fresh pineapple, 40,000 d., 5,000 d. and 5,000 d. respectively.  The pineapple was sold to me by a young boy named Long (&ldquo;my name Long; you remember Long.&rdquo;) and I absolutely didn&rsquo;t want the pineapple, given that I wasn&rsquo;t hungry and just wanted to stroll around the beach alone.  He asked for 15,000 d. at first, but finally dropped his price to 5,000 dong (US$ 0.33) and I still said no.  He offered to take my picture, an offer I accepted, and I don&rsquo;t know if he intended to ask me for money, but I gave him a dollar for his efforts and a hopeful intention that it would in fact help his life.</p>

<p>I headed back to the roofed area and was presented with the opportunity to buy more things (massage, shake, bracelets).  I ended up paying way too much for the bracelet (sucker!) but the rest was lovely.</p>

<p>We headed back by way of a cafe, or maybe the cafe was first, but in any case, the very coolest thing occurred: I spoke Japanese with a Vietnamese waitress in the cafe!  It wasn&rsquo;t much of a conversation - just when and where and how long we studied.  She had been much more intense with her studies and had more vocabulary than me, but I loved being able to do that.</p>

<p>We stopped by Tam&rsquo;s again on the way out of town, for final goodbyes.  She gave me a hematite necklace!!!  Holy moly. I was just beyond words surprised and blessed.</p>

<p>After that, Ninh took me to Marble Mountain, where marble is quarried to be carved into lions, fish, balls, fountains, Buddhas, chess sets, jewelry, plates, bowls, etc etc. He announced that he would meet me in one hour, and I must admit I felt a bit afraid that I wouldn&rsquo;t get back on the ship in time.  I visualized myself happily exchanging stories onboard, and left it at that. I bought nothing but a ticket up the mountain (1000 d. I think) and wow.  It was really cool.  I love climbing, so it was perfect for me.  Not like rock climbing with ropes, but rock hopping with bare feet.  I scampered up the large steps and got to a three way fork in the trail.  One way had a cave, and the other two ways went up (if I recall correctly) and I chose one of the not-cave ways randomly.  I climbed some more and found a cave entrance which I entered, a bit concerned about the floor as I couldn&rsquo;t see where my feet were headed in the dark, to find a standing Buddha-esque statue standing in a vertical column about 50 feet tall and 3 meters in diameter.  The walls boasted names painted or carved into the rock.  Past the statue was an opening that went nearly vertically upward (with step-like rocks that made it easy) and I ascended to a lovely view of the ocean.  Beyond lovely: it was absolutely gorgeous with gentle waves visiting the shore and a village mixed with trees and lovely plains on the other side.</p>

<p>I could have stayed much longer, but I had an appointment with Ninh and a boat, so I scampered back down the mountain and steps, barefootin&rsquo; it all the way, much to my soles&rsquo; delight.  I was offered surprisingly good prices on a waterfountain, which, if it was the actual price, and had I a way to bring it home, I would have taken her up on it.  Like US$20 for a carved marble fountain 4 feet tall and a sphere on top that spun in the water.  Wow.  A bit pricey to get it shipped home, I&rsquo;m guessing. (ps: that price might have been misunderstood or misremembered)  Vietnam is <em>definitely</em> a country I wish to visit again for a few weeks.  Camping and biking around sounds <em>great</em>.</p>

<p class=date>My trip to Ink's Lake - Mar. 22 - Mar. 27, 1987</p>

<p>It was to be a fun trip.  We were going to go to Ink&rsquo;s lake, go
spelunking, canoing, rappelling, climbing, and a whole bunch of fun
stuff.  It was pretty fun. Now it is March 29, and I just relayed the
whole trip to a tape recorder.  Here&rsquo;s how it went:</p>

<p>We left Tomball, A
little late, but we left.  All our stuff was cram-packed in the back
of the bus.  I was in the furthest seat back with Wade Johnson.  We
were talkin&rsquo; and listening to tapes and stuff.. just messing around.
Then 3 of the girls decided to take a nap on our stuff.  Throughout
the trip, it got more crowded back there every day.  It was Pam,
Renae, and Beth who went back.  I&rsquo;m going to go through the trip
faster than this.</p>

<p>We rented canoes along the way; while we were
there, we chunked a little pink cloth frisbee around. We stopped for a
snack near Bastrop, and had supper at McDonalds in Austin.  I called
Christy Deans from there, well, I tried.  She wasn&rsquo;t there.  We
weren&rsquo;t too wild.  We got to Inks Lake at 7:30.  It was a perfect
night.  No clouds, No wind, nice temperature.  We unloaded and put our
stuff under a tree on a tarp where we were going to sleep.  We went
into a cabin a messed around. Mike Hurt and I were sitting with our
legs straight, then using our arms to press up into handstands.  We
all tried some stuff with a broom - put it behind your back, bring it
over your head, put one leg around your arm and back over the broom,
bring it back over your head and then step across with your other leg.
Wow!  We wold hold it and jump over it.  We did fingertip
pullups&hellip; just showin&rsquo; off.  We did that thing where you take three
foot length steps back from a wall, put your head against it, pick up
something then straighten up. keeping our legs straight.  I could do
it.  Only girls are supposed to be able to.  Beth went over to a tree
and started climbing.  Everyone followed.  We had like a line of
people climbing up and jumping off a branch.  Eventualy we all got
tired and everyone but a few people lay down under that tree. We
watched shooting stars, told stories, and jokes, we sang some.  I
played mercy with Mike Hurt.  We were perfectly matched.  We slept at
about 2:30am.</p>

<p>At 3:00 it started raining.  We all jumped up and went
to a cabin.  It started raining hard, then.  Wind was blowin&rsquo; it right
in the screen.  We were totally crammed against the wall under the
screen.  Barry then got up and got a tarp to put on the windows
outside.  The wind kept it smacked up there all nigth.  I slept O.K. -
woke up at about 8:00 &amp; took a shower (all the hot water was gone) I
froze!  The wind was still blowing making it worse.  My voice was a
little hoarse.  I went into the breakfast cabin, and helped cook.
Then we played frisbee, frisbee football, we tossed washers, we did
some double stunts - stand on someones shoulders -, played on some
see-saws, a slide, and swings.  I learned how to flip out of a swing.
Not from my back, but sitting.  The trick is to hold on to the chains
until you are rightside up.  Mike and Renae taught me how.  I did
double stunts with Pam.</p>

<p>We went on the canoe trip. I was with Mike
Hamm and Wade.  We jumped in and were cruisin&rsquo;.  Wade was humming the
theme from Hawaii 5-0.  The wind was blowin&rsquo; so hard that Pam, Beth,
Renae got dumped over. Wade and I helped them.  Then came some rapids.
Mr. Hamm told us to go through them a certain way so we wouldn&rsquo;t tip.
We said fine.  No problem.  Oh- before the rapids we had taken our
shirts off and tied them to the cross bars on the canoe.  So we went
through the first part of the rapids real easily.  Then we turned to
go down the next section, and the wind took the chance and blew us
sideways.  We took in about 6 inches of water at first, and we were
trying to keep cool (ha ha) and say no prob.  Then we had to hit a
wave and ended up about half full of water.  We were still saying&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s cool - we can do it.  Then one last time and we sank.  Wade
immediately jumped out a swam for shore.  The canoe turned over and
Mike crawled on top.  I was hanging on to the side, telling Mike it
was O.K. and trying to get used to the water.  Then I pulled our conoe
to a dock Wade had run to.  We got there, dumped it out, and were
freezin&rsquo;.  There was an old dude watching us.  It was his dock.  Then
we went across the river to where the Torgesens and Glen were.  We
tied up and waited for the others. I lay out on a rock gettin&rsquo; a tan
during that time.</p>

<p>After about another hour, everyone was there and we
played some games and told jokes.  I learned the 7 game then.  Later,
the camper got there and we chunked a football and 2 tennis balls
around.  We waited some more and then went back to camp.  Mike Hurt
and Mr. Hamm took the canoes back that afternoon.  We had supper in
Burnet.  We went to Dairy Queen to eat.  I bought a banana split and a
shake and a glass of water.  Nothing nutritious.  Then we went to buy
groceries.  I drove Mike Hurt around in a shopping cart.  We read
magazines, and messed around.  Mike juggled some things, like boxes of
raisins, or cans of peas.  We just had a good time.  I slept in the
crazy group.  Not the Ahlborns&rsquo; clan, but Glen, John, Brian, Dave,
Eric (not Shafer), and Tim.  We gambled and ate M&amp;M and crackerjacks.</p>

<p>We read Tim&rsquo;s National Enquirerer- all the STUPID things in it.  We
slept at about 12:00 and Brian and I woke at about 6:00 to get warm
showers.  It worked.  By this time, I had lost a shirt, a pair of
socks, shampoo, toothpaste, and my soap.  Oh well.  We went back to
the breakfast cabin.  Then we played in the field again - just messing
around until the Vanishing Texas River Cruise.  Each ticket was 10
bucks.  We all just layed out on the top deck and got some sleep.
Mike Hurt and I took everything off except shorts to get a tan.  We
saw some water falls, Spanish Daggers (that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in our front
yard), some Spanish goats, and some double crested Camerons.  Glen
called them Double Breasted&hellip; whatever.</p>

<p>The narrator? of the cruise
came up a few times to compliment our good behavior.  The last time we
were singing the theme from Giligan&rsquo;s Island.  Then later in the
afternoon, we went rappeling.  That was scary!  Getting over the edge
was against all instincts.  I was the first to go after Mike Hurt
did. (He was a college councilor for the trip).  We went swimming.
The wind had slowed some so it wasn&rsquo;t too bad.</p>

<p>We had supper in
Burnet again.  this time at Mr. Gatti&rsquo;s.  We were getting a little
wild here, but not too bad.  I had one piece of Eric Shafer&rsquo;s Pizza,
and I bought some cinamon bread sticks.  I was the last to order
anything and Brian and I were the last people in there.  We were
talking to the girl working there.  She had blonde hair and looked
like that girl on &ldquo;Heart of the City.&rdquo;  She was really pretty.  then
we crusied back to the camp.</p>

<p>I was in the crazy group again.  We were
messin&rsquo; around outside.  We threw rocks at the Alhborns&rsquo; group&rsquo;s
cabin.  Glen pissed in a can of Dr. Pepper and threw it on the roof.
Then we played Gastapo until about 12:30.  I slept outside with Eric
Shafer, Gary Picou, Mike hurt, Mike Hamm, and me.  I woke up, showered
(warm) and went to the breakfast cabin.  I asked Mr. Cowan what day it
was, and he said &ldquo;Wednesday the 25th.&rdquo;  If he hadn&rsquo;t said &ldquo;25th&rdquo; I
would not have remembered my B-day.</p>

<p>That day we went to West Cave and
Enchanted rock.  West Cave was neat.  We went down into a canyon by a
river.  We followed a little creek upstream to a horseshoe shaped
waterfall.  You could walk under the horseshoe behind the waterfall.
On one side of the HorseShoe, the water had fallen for so long
(100,000 yrs.) that a curtain of rock was formed, creating a cave.  It
was truly awesome. Then we went to Enchanted Rock.  On the way we
stopped at another horseshoe shaped falls.  This one was bigger,
though, and much prettier.  The water was <em><b>crystal</b></em> blue.  So
beautiful!!!</p>

<p>We ate lunch there.  I sat with Renae, Pam, Beth, Allan,
and Wade.  Renae dropped her apple into the water twice.  I walked
aroud behind the waterfall, where Carl was.  Then we all went back and
finished our trip to Enchanted Rock.  Enchanted R. was great.  I did a
crack climb with Mr. Hamm, a friction climb with Mr. Cowan, and tried
Ben&rsquo;s Climb.  Mr. Hamms climb was easy when you figured out how to put
your feet and hands to brace right.  Mr. Cowan&rsquo;s was easy for me.  I
just kept clawing around for a grip with my hands.  Ben&rsquo;s Climb was
tough!  Only Beth and Mike Hurt could do it.  Barry couldn&rsquo;t ven.  I
tried hard though, and got some good scratches trying, but nope.  I
was unable to form a fist in a certain crack to pull myself up with,
and Mike was not there to show me another way.  But, it was a noble
effort.</p>

<p>We went to Dairy Queen that night for supper.  the girl
working there asked us for our name when we ordered to make it more
personal. I said Ted for my name.  I got a hamburger and water and a
blizzard with M&amp;M&rsquo;s in it.  Brian got cold fajitas.  That was funny.
Later I went up there with Dave and ordered a blizzard.  We went down
the whole list, rejecting each item that was offered to put in it.
Then I said, &ldquo;How &lsquo;bout French Fries?&rdquo;  the girl sorta grossed out
then said sure.  I decided not, although everyone said Goforit!  I
just got M&amp;Ms again.</p>

<p>We went to camp after that and slept, got up the
next morning, took showers, and left for Waco.  We at breakfast and
McD&rsquo;s.  We were fairly wild then.  I got about 12 straws.  We played
outside some and then continued on.  We got to Waco, stopped had lunch
and then went to the palentelogical dig site.  There were bones of 15
mammoths there.  They all died right together.  We were trying to
figure out how they may have died.  Flood, Smoke, hunters, Lightning.
The Alhborn&rsquo;s thought of lightning.  Actually I did too, but I didn&rsquo;t
say anything because no one would have believed me.  Lightning
happened to be the guys&rsquo; favorite theory too.  Then he took us to a
big pit where there were a whole bunch of fossils.  Including shells,
shark teeth, starfish parts, and other things. I found a ski rope for
cave men, a broken Egyption compact disk, a skeleton of a Hobbit (I
didn&rsquo;t touch it because it was a grave), solid gold coins (too heavy
to carry), a complete shark skeleton (it was buried so I couldn&rsquo;t dig
it up), and a pteredactyl (it flew away).  So I didn&rsquo;t come back with
much to show for my finds.  Oh Yeah- a piece of the Rosetta Stone (it
fell out of a hole in my pocket) Oh, well.</p>

<p>We went to Mother Neff
that evening.  We played the ABC game along the way.  I helped cook
ribs with Mike Hurt that night.  I slept with the Alhborns&rsquo; group
again that night. I learned how to play murder and I got to talk to
Beth some and got to know her which was nice.  We heard some noises
that sounded like thunder.  It turned out to be a nearby military base
going through a simulation.  &ldquo;Playing Gastapo&rdquo; as I put it.  We got to
sleep-in the next morning.  We were going home that day, and we didn&rsquo;t
have to hurry.  There was plenty of hot water for showers.  There were
only 2 showers though.  Barry and I were in the shower part of the
bathroom at the same time.  We sang Lean On Me, and the national
anthem.  Wade and the Torgesens were bangin&rsquo; on the door to tell us to
hurry.</p>

<p>After that we ate breakfast and played washers.  I took some
pictures, and played frisbee.  John, Glen and I got a frisbee triangle
going.  Then we left.  We played the ABC game.  Only Me Glen John and
Tim made it all the way through.  Our list was, Australo-Burilicus,
Beer, Carmeron, Deoxyribonucleic acid, Elephantitis, Financial
advisor, Ganglion, Hypogryph, Intestinal gas flareup, Jumping Jack,
Kilomanjaro, Lopsa-apa, Mucus membranes, Nasal passages, Orthodontist,
Pathalogical Rapist, Quackological speech therapist, Reggae,
Supercalifragilisticexpialidoches, Thermo-molecular cumulo-rhumbic
with a linear postulation in section four on the left hand side,
Urinary passage, Vortices, Winnie the Pooh, Xenophobic nightmares,
Yugoslavian barbaric eras of time, and Zambia.  Pretty awesome, huh?</p>

<p>We went crazy at McD&rsquo;s.  We all ordered from one register, about
$70. I got a Big Mac, a hamburger, ice water, ice cream cone, apple
pie, and a medium Dr. Pepper.  Then I went back for a shake and
another pie.  I made off with about 25 straws from there.  Then it was
sleep for me until I got home.  I got everything back except
toothpaste, which I had left at home.  Dave got Mike Hurt&rsquo;s address.
Mike said we should plan a trip to Enchanted Rock.  He said he and a
friend could take about 8 of us.  I hope I can go.  Tim&rsquo;s mom took me
and Dave home, and that&rsquo;s it.  It was fun. We got home Friday- of
course.  I told Fred some of my jokes.  I think I&rsquo;m going to reserve
some pages in here for jokes and stories.  They may be the first pages
listed in my table of contents.</p>
