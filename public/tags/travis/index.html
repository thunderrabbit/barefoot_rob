<p>Today Lin and I drove to Travis and Yumi&rsquo;s place to hang out with them
and Sakura.  Johan was already there and Deji came a bit later.  Nice
to see everyone again, though in some ways it&rsquo;s like the tribe is
getting smaller (and larger!)</p>

<p>No BBQ today due to rain, but we made 手巻き with chicken, eggs,
salad, and then ice cream at the end.</p>

<p>We laughed a lot, played with (funny) rubber balls, retrieved toys
from under the sofa set, and had a great time.</p>

<p>Peeps were ready to leave by the time I had to leave to get to men&rsquo;s
circle on time tonight, so Lin drove us to the station.  Driving a car
takes (unpredictably) longer than taking a train, so I took a train.</p>

<p>Deji and I sat on Yokohama line for a bit, talking about what racism
actually means.  He made a distinction between &ldquo;pre judging&rdquo; (making
predictions about someone) and &ldquo;prejuduce&rdquo; (assuming superiority over
someone).</p>

<p>Sweet!  Lin and I hung out with Yumi and Travis, respectively, in
Shinjuku for a couple of hours, and an hour, respectively.</p>

<p>(as I write this, the above sentence seems comprehensible)</p>

<p>Lin called me while I was working at home, and kinda in a
break-needing stage, so I jumped at the chance to meet Travis, for
what I suspect is the last time before he starts his new project(s).</p>

<p>I told them it would take an hour to get there, but I made good time
by jogging most of the way to the station (I made 13 minutes of a
25-minute walk) and <em>just</em> caught the express train to Shinjuku.</p>

<p>I felt sorry for the other passengers cause I was a bit sweaty and
stinky on the train after having jogged a lot of the way.</p>

<p>Ate at Bangkok House or something and then went to a pay-by-weight
frozen yogurt place called Menchies or something.  I got a bit over
300 grams apparently.</p>

<p>Travis and I talked computer stuff, and Yumi and Lin talked girl
stuff. I&rsquo;m so happy that they&rsquo;re such good friends.  Travis talked
about how &ldquo;multi-tasking&rdquo; at programming projects loses a lot of time (in
context switching), and I was like &ldquo;yep; I&rsquo;m experiencing that now,&rdquo;
with (multiple) iOS projects, websites for AB, and CB, plus trying to
get sb&rsquo;s servers all Ubuntu 16ed.  This time, using Ansible, instead
of blah blah by hand.  Oh, plus <a href="https://www.krimms.com/">https://www.krimms.com/</a> which I just
finished for Simon in exchange for four (4) oz of .999 pure silver
coins.</p>

<p>Maki, Kaori, Yohan, Yukari, Yumi, Lin, and I went to a Nepalese
restaurant called <a href="https://www.nepalico.com/">Nepalico</a> behind Cerulean

<p>We are in Yakushiikekoen (sorry about romanji) chillin&rsquo; under a wooden
roof thing that looks vaguely new like they might rebuild it every
couple of years.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s enjoying Yumi&rsquo;s camera as they pose like apes in Yumi&rsquo;s natural
state.</p>

<p>We were originally scheduled to go to Kids Country, but when I saw the
hordes headed that direction, I suggested we might do that on a
different day, perhaps?  So glad they agreed!</p>

<h2 id="19-00">19:00</h2>

<p>At Yumi&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; house, after yummy dinner, chillin&rsquo; with Travis,
scoopin&rsquo; up 4G wifi to show him /r/bitTippers and /r/getFairShare.</p>

<p>He showed me /r/thebutton, which I still have not pressed, and
probably won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p class="dream">In a slightly enclosed area, Travis and I were
playing a version of baseball.  We would each take one turn at bat,
and keep track of where our ghost players had made it around the
bases.  We were pretty well tied, though we kept getting hits.  It was
my turn at bat, and someone gave me a broken bat as a joke, so I used
it as a joke and got a pretty good hit, making it to third base,
though Travis tagged home base before my ghost runner would have made
it there.  I was sure next time I could make it to first, and
therefore my ghost on third would get a run.</p>

<p class="dream">
Travis and I were in a virtual reality on my computer.  He showed me a
room that was similar to what I had seen before, so I almost didn't go
inside to explore.  Then I was like, "wait if Travis showed me this,
it must be cool" so I went inside to check the place out.  It was
*amazing* with 3D virtual games inside the groom, a hologram which
could be manipulated by touching the screen and project into the room;
and some hidden rooms behind the walls with hinged doors on mirrors
that caused the hologram to reflect "infinitely" back and forth; it
was so realistic that I made a joke "the Matrix is everywhere".
</p>

<p class="dream">
I found a super hidden corner which even Travis hadn't heard about
while reading people's logs about exploring the place; it was hidden
behind an inflatable statue and in between the statue and the wall was
a panel that could be opened and revealed a mirror hinged between a
panel hinged between a mirror and the mirrors were offset from each
other so I wondered how they functioned while hinged like that.  I
pulled the device out and showed Travis but he said he hadn't seen it
before.  Wow. I was one of the first people on the internet to find
this part of this virtual room!  Travis said he had to get going and
was glad that I had enjoyed the place.  Most def!  So we started to
lock up everything the way we had found it and one door was unable
to lock because its adjoining latch was on a frame that had been bent
so that the door coudln't reach it anymrore. I guessed we had to leave
that part open.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I saw that Travis had picked up a lot of broken glass to clean up the
place and I got a trtansmission from Marcel who was like, "dude are
you still there?" cause he had read my journal entry about it and
wanted to see the place as well, so he beamed over and I was like,
"Duuuuude!" and he was like "Duuuuuude!!" and I introduced Travis
and Marcel and then they were talking for a bit but Travis had to go
so Marcel was talking to me to see the new thing I had found.  I
told him I forgot to take pictures and he was like, "aw man I knew
I should have contacted you sooner!"
</p>

<p class="dream">
I stepped over a virtual tar pit  and started to wake up.

<p>I&rsquo;m so lucky to have an awesome programmer friend like Travis.  :-)</p>

<p>Over the past few days we have been emailing back and forth, mostly
with me going &ldquo;uh huh&rdquo; &ldquo;yeah&rdquo; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right&rdquo; &ldquo;great!&rdquo; as he explains
the intricacies of the best way to create a haskell library.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying <a href="https://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell</a>
and considering buying Graham Hutton&rsquo;s book, and am excited to have my
static journal back, very excited to have Travis making a kick-ass
library to seamlessly(?) connect with Hakyll to make it
journalistic&hellip;  I&rsquo;m certain that some of the code he writes will end
up in the main Hakyll library.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching my new/old/new hakyll-journal repository, and just
happened to catch the first little bit, 3 minutes after he committed
it.</p>
