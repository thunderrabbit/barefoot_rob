<p>Last night I decided to look at using <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot</a>
to develop our next game.  I downloaded and opened it up, but it could
not open the list of templates.</p>

<p><strong>Operating system or device, Godot version:</strong></p>

<p>OS X 10.12.6, Godot v2.1.4.stable.official</p>

<p><strong>Issue description:</strong></p>

<p>Run Godot first time, the Project Manager window appears, but cannot connect to sample templates.</p>

<pre><code>Can't connect to host: https://godotengine.org/asset-library/api
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like the same as <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/7545">#7545</a>, but on OS X instead of Windows</p>

<p><strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Open Godot in OS X
Wait 30 seconds for it to load
Click Templates tab in Godot Engine - Project Manager window
Error message appears at the bottom
</code></pre>

<p><code>Can't connect to host: https://godotengine.org/asset-library/api</code></p>

<p><strong>Screenshot:</strong></p>

<p>Oops shit.  I didn&rsquo;t fully test the system before putting admin server
live.  That shit won&rsquo;t happen again because I&rsquo;ve got Ghost Inspector
on my side, helping me inspect the site.  I&rsquo;ve taught it how to test
logging in, fucking up the log in, viewing the units list, and the
unit edit page, as well as the group-of-units list and the
group-of-units edit page.</p>

<p>I still need to teach it how to check inquiries, both saved and
unsaved, plus contacts, owners, sets and some other shit, but thanks
to Ghost Inspector Runscape package, I get 1000 free tests per month.
Yay!  I really want to pay them something though.  I paid Alan who
made ngrok so I figure I might as well pay Ghost Inspector cause it
seems they are actually doing more.</p>

<p>As soon as I get home, I&rsquo;ll push this not fully tested fix online,
then get back to making more tests.  Aww yeah.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not 100% sure this is a bug, but I reported to AWS a few days
ago:</p>

<pre><code>S3 bug: cannot create two lifecycle rules that apply to whole S3 bucket
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s just the title; I spelled it out a bit in the body of the
message.</p>

<p>But today I got back a steaming pile of useless reply:</p>

<pre><code>Hello Rob,

This is ______ from the AWS Billing Department.

Thank you for contacting AWS Billing and Accounts support.  I
apologize for the issue you've been experiencing with S3.

Unfortunately, the complexity of your question is outside our
scope of knowledge here in Billing and Accounts ... blah blah
</code></pre>

<p>Okay so fine; I&rsquo;m not paying for support, so my ticket gets low
priority.  But I didn&rsquo;t ask a question.  I&rsquo;m trying to help out
Amazon.</p>

<p>If I remember, I will send them the identical message via an account
which has support as an option and see how they respond.</p>

<p>Man oh man I&rsquo;m lucky there aren&rsquo;t that many affected rows, but when AB
client requested that four fields in their main table allow DECIMAL
values and not just INTegers, I didn&rsquo;t change the
summary-of-main-table in the same way.  So each time a record was
saved to main table, its summary was saved with truncated values in
those fields.</p>

<p>Dang.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there aren&rsquo;t many times that decimal values are needed in
those fields.  (&hellip; which is why INTs worked for them originally.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fixed now, but I need to create a query that will return all main
field records with decimal values so AB staff can go back and update
the corresponding summary-of-main-table records as needed.</p>

<h2 id="16-33">16:33</h2>

<p>For the query I mentioned, I could simply define a query to do it,
which I&rsquo;ve done before, but all in code.  I wonder if I can set up a
query in the DB, give it some meta-data and let the code write itself?</p>

<h2 id="15-28-thursday-12-november-2015-jst">15:28 Thursday 12 November 2015 JST</h2>

<p>So I wrote half the code to allow queries to be stored in the DB, but
then abandoned it in favor of doing some other (higher priority (and
higher paying)) tasks first.</p>

<p>A couple days ago I noted someone burst a bubble on
<a href="https://www.poppopchaos.com/">Pop Pop Chaos</a>, so I joined the fun!  It
seemed s/he was only interested in bursting bubbles, not creating
them, so I created some, and then joined the fun and we just popped
alll the bubbles.  The white ones kept coming back, as they do, but
then after a while I created a bunch of blue bubbles in a row, so he&rsquo;d
(be more likely to) know it wasn&rsquo;t computer-generated bubbles, well..
not algorithm generated,.. well, anyway, then blam!  he made a bunch
of yellow bubbles, and raced up the leaderboard and then suddenly
vanished!  I was like O_o what happened?</p>

<p>I found houston:admin, which perfectly augmented the app with DB admin
skillz.  Perfect!  I discovered what happened: in his flurry of
creates, rancidpony won a race with the server and created more
bubbles than he had points to create!</p>

<p>His point value went negative and he promptly vanished from the high
score list, because that&rsquo;s how I was distinguishing <em>my</em> account
(which always has permissions to create, despite its score of -2300 or
something.</p>

<p>So I retooled the logic which populates the leaderboard to say admin
cannot join, but negative score people are welcome.  So rancidpony has
-35 points and is halfway up the leaderboard!</p>

<p>AND <a href="https://www.poppopchaos.com/about">rancidpony is credited</a> with
finding a bug. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hmm my automagical report generator doesn&rsquo;t automagically pull in the
buildings table when users request # of minutes to station, which
