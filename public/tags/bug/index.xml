      <description>05:46 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST Last night I decided to look at using Godot to develop our next game. I downloaded and opened it up, but it could not open the list of templates.
Operating system or device, Godot version:
OS X 10.12.6, Godot v2.1.4.stable.official
Issue description:
Run Godot first time, the Project Manager window appears, but cannot connect to sample templates.
Can&#39;t connect to host: https://godotengine.org/asset-library/api  Looks like the same as #7545, but on OS X instead of Windows</description>

      <description>18:50 Wednesday 13 January 2016 JST Oops shit. I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully test the system before putting admin server live. That shit won&amp;rsquo;t happen again because I&amp;rsquo;ve got Ghost Inspector on my side, helping me inspect the site. I&amp;rsquo;ve taught it how to test logging in, fucking up the log in, viewing the units list, and the unit edit page, as well as the group-of-units list and the group-of-units edit page.</description>

      <description>16:33 Wednesday 13 January 2016 JST Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% sure this is a bug, but I reported to AWS a few days ago:
S3 bug: cannot create two lifecycle rules that apply to whole S3 bucket  That&amp;rsquo;s just the title; I spelled it out a bit in the body of the message.
But today I got back a steaming pile of useless reply:
Hello Rob, This is ______ from the AWS Billing Department.</description>

      <description>15:45 Wednesday 11 November 2015 JST Man oh man I&amp;rsquo;m lucky there aren&amp;rsquo;t that many affected rows, but when AB client requested that four fields in their main table allow DECIMAL values and not just INTegers, I didn&amp;rsquo;t change the summary-of-main-table in the same way. So each time a record was saved to main table, its summary was saved with truncated values in those fields.
Dang.
Fortunately, there aren&amp;rsquo;t many times that decimal values are needed in those fields.</description>

      <description>18:29 Tuesday 01 September 2015 JST A couple days ago I noted someone burst a bubble on Pop Pop Chaos, so I joined the fun! It seemed s/he was only interested in bursting bubbles, not creating them, so I created some, and then joined the fun and we just popped alll the bubbles. The white ones kept coming back, as they do, but then after a while I created a bunch of blue bubbles in a row, so he&amp;rsquo;d (be more likely to) know it wasn&amp;rsquo;t computer-generated bubbles, well.</description>

Hmm my automagical report generator doesn&amp;rsquo;t automagically pull in the buildings table when users request # of minutes to station, which requires the building ID to look up the stations.</description>
