<h2 id="10-59-thursday-19-july-2018-jst">10:59 Thursday 19 July 2018 JST</h2>

<p>Tonight I chose to work on my anger related to things not going my
way.</p>

<p>Anger: why is this person standing blocking the escalator keeping
people from going up?</p>

<p>Anger: why would R-san not trust a professional wine taster that he
knows how to taste wine without getting drunk?</p>

<p>Anger: why would A-san suggest popcorn style for people to speak up
instead of just asking each person?</p>

<p>Following the anger back, I came upon a scene in the game room back in
the house where we lived until I was 7 years old.  We had some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_car_racing">slot cars</a> that my dad
showed me how to put oil on the cars to make them go faster.  I put
oil on them and basically clogged up the motors so they hardly ran at
all.</p>

<p>My dad was so mad at me.  He&rsquo;s the one who fuckin&rsquo; showed me how to
add oil to them!!</p>

<p>In my mind, I went back to the scene to just sit with myself-at-age-7
and be with him.  Daddy was at work; mommy was at work.  He was alone
playing with the cars, likely trying to show his brother or the
neighbor kids how to make the cars faster.</p>

<p>In my mind, I went to bat for 7-year-old-me when my dad came home.
&ldquo;Well, you showed him how to do it, and he did it.  It&rsquo;s gonna be
okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I allowed 7-year-old-me to come live in my heart and everything be
okay.</p>

<p>I withdrew the projection that A-san doing popcorn style is
imperfect.  It&rsquo;s going to be okay.</p>

<p>I withdrew my projection that R-san should assume pro-san knows what
he is doing.  Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I withdrew the projection that escalator-san was doing anything wrong
by standing there.  Maybe they are keeping back a few seconds so I
won&rsquo;t get hit by a car later.</p>
