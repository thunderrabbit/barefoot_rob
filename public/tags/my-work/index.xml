      <description>10:59 Thursday 19 July 2018 JST Tonight I chose to work on my anger related to things not going my way.
Anger: why is this person standing blocking the escalator keeping people from going up?
Anger: why would R-san not trust a professional wine taster that he knows how to taste wine without getting drunk?
Anger: why would A-san suggest popcorn style for people to speak up instead of just asking each person?</description>
