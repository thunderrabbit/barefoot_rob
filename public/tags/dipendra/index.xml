      <description>17:26 Friday 02 November 2018 JST Today I met with Tariq and Dipendra to talk about ConSwi. They are all excited about the graphics and I am in the camp of getting a minimum viable product out. I want to empower Dipendra to update the graphics in the app. He got a copy of Conswi from Github. Instead of giving him write access to the app, I had him create his own account and push to his own ConSwi.</description>
