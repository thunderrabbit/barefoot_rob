      <description>19:51 Thursday 11 July 2019 JST Today there were only 1.5 students in my Akihabara class. This number is down from our high of like 8 last year when I had to stop checking homework during the lesson because there ended up being no time for class. I guess there would be time with just 2 students&amp;rsquo; worth of homework.
Anyway, the lesson kinda devolved into a China vs Japan debate.</description>

      <description>18:17 Saturday 16 December 2017 I bought five puzzles today after seeing some that I had had as a kid. The woman at the shop suggested four as being difficult, and I selected a fifth one because I liked its design.</description>
