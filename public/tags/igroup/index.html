<p>I have been doing MKP stuff for a while.  Today I expressed in my
online group that I did not want to be there and I do not always want
to be there.  I am so thankful that I could just let loose with a
barrage|littany of the stuff rolling through my mind and the men could
be there just to hear me.  It was stuff like</p>

<pre><code>&quot;I don't fucking want to always be here and I don't want to check
out by email and that all started from when I just said I wanted
to start the group on time and now here we are today not starting
on time and a bunch of men checking out via email neither of which
is what I fucking was trying for in the first place.  If I am not
here the group might miss me and I might miss the perfect person
to facilitate me, and I miss JG and he is not here&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>blah blah like that for a bit.</p>

<p>The learning I got from that was the title of my upcoming blog entry,
&ldquo;Self care must come first&rdquo; though I will probably add &ldquo;usually&rdquo; in
there somewhere. This is certainly true for a group of peers, each of
whom can ostensibly take care of themselves.</p>

<p>If I do not take care of myself, then I can not be there for the
group.</p>

<p>Dangit.  Speaking of which, my wrists are hurting while I I type this
(on the train, so voice transcription is not a polite option).  Where
is the self care now?</p>

<p>Just finished four lessons at SCC: Naoko, Liliko, Hitomi, and Yasu
each had 30 minute lessons, practicing various parts of their
presentations.</p>

<p>During the first two lessons, my nose was running like yuck.  I used a
bunch of toilet paper and tissues blowing all the snot out.</p>

<p>This morning I worked on MT3 for 1.5 hours or so, getting maybe 8
frames taken.  At this point, I am working on version 2 of the
website, which focuses on the characters making the track instead of
me making the characters make the track.</p>

<p>Men&rsquo;s group at 10:30 featured 10 or 11 men, a relatively big group.  I
had a great cry during which I realized I feel tons of shame and
sadness about how much I have <em>not</em> accomplished in Japan.  I should
be making a good living, but I am still paycheck to paycheck and it
sucks.  That is the main reason I cannot go back to US every year.</p>

<p>In other news:</p>

<ul>
<li>I will go on Monday to replace <em>both</em> fans and the battery in this
computer (MacBook Pro, 2012)</li>
<li>I have gotten more than half of the classes in AB websites to be
autoloaded per <a href="https://leanpub.com/mlaphp">MLAPHP</a></li>
<li>Will meet Tariq tomorrow to finalize(?) the specs/screens for
version 1 of ConSwi</li>
<li>In the middle of training at TY, helping Jay with that.</li>
<li>Great workshop presentation by Dora yesterday, and am inspired to do
the same myself, but $3000?  See the above-mentioned
paycheck-to-paycheck comment.</li>

<p>Today was the fifth of five virtual I-groups designed to give
leadership practice to men in the group.  Just five men in the group,
one night each gives a sense of what it&rsquo;s like and lets men see other
men leading the calls.</p>

<p>So I will be the leader leader of the next set of calls, planned for 6
calls starting in October.</p>

<p>Okay so for a long time I have used &ldquo;I-group&rdquo; or igroup or some
variant to describe my men&rsquo;s circle.  This nomenclature might be
confusing, so I shall now call it Integration Group.</p>

<p>We had two new men in I-group on Tuesday.  Awesome. I&rsquo;m now suggesting
that we meet every week, instead of just twice a month.  I&rsquo;ve emailed
Prentiss to see about running the initial 6 week I-group protocols.</p>
