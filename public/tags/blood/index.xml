      <description>22:47 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST I am at a hospital with Lin after a little fender bender involving a guy&amp;rsquo;s shoulder hitting her mirror hard enough to cut her hand as the glass shattered into her open window.
The police officer came and suggested it will be easiest/cheapest overall if they don&amp;rsquo;t sue each other and just do 50&amp;frasl;50 blame and call it in to their respective insurance companies.</description>

      <description>11:35 Sunday 15 November 2015 JST Lin&amp;rsquo;s driving, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to work on my computer in the passenger&amp;rsquo;s seat.
Huh. This car turns off its engine each time we come to a full stop.</description>

      <description>16:28 Thursday 12 November 2015 JST bah. Had I gone before my OZ trip, I&amp;rsquo;d (likely) have been accepted, and would have finished nearly a month of the 3 month countdown between donations.</description>
