      <description>20:06 Monday 24 July 2017 JST Worked at AK today for a 2 hour lesson. Pretty great because the students are all talkative and asked questions and such. Chatted a bit and then showed them an article I used with other class. This class had much higher comprehension of the article&amp;hellip; which is good, but shows me just how too-high the article was for my other class.
After the lesson, Eiko walked me back nearly to the security gate, asking about PB a bit.</description>
