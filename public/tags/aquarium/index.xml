      <description>16:09 Sunday 13 August 2017 JST The aquarium in Shinagawa is more of a madhouse on holidays. It has really been modernized with touch screens, a rocking boat (amusement park ride which does not go very high, but features at least as shrill screams as any scream machine), some fireworks themed lights, and that&amp;rsquo;s before we get to see any real fish!
The most interesting thing for me is the plexiglass arch which forms a tunnel under which we can walk and over which fish (mostly manta rays) can swim.</description>
