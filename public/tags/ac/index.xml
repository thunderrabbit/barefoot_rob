      <description>18:44 Friday 11 August 2017 JST Welp, I gave in. But I like to think my computer gave in. There have been a couple of times this summer that I could not get work done because my computer overheated and refuxed to turn on or do things like accept keyboard / mouse input.
My room gets a bit hot, even with windows open,.. and I realized recently, I have taken more naps because of my computer (and I) overheating, so it has actually affected my income.</description>
