<p>Heh.  Well, it was pretty great.  Dirk Gently&rsquo;s Holistic Detective
Agency was good enough that I just watched the last four (4) episodes
in a row.  At 40+ minutes each that&rsquo;s 160+ minutes or about oh my god
I have to go to bed.</p>

<p>Now it is apparently canceled, but I hope not.

<p>I watched episodes 2 and 3 of The Defenders today, some kinda expanded
world offshoot from Danny Rand the Iron Fist.  It&rsquo;s good, but to quote
Alfonzo, c&rsquo;mon Iron Fist, let me sleep.</p>

<p>While I was walking out of Ueno station, a tall man and I did the
foreigner nod and then he said he had seen me on TV (for being
barefoot).  We shook hands and talked for a bit about the importance
of doing one&rsquo;s own thing.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;I respect you,&rdquo; and I should have said if he sees
respectability in me, that means it&rsquo;s in him, too.</p>

<p>I gotta stop and chat a bit longer to people who say HI like that, but
I dunno what to say.  Maybe I will ask if they live in Tokyo.</p>

<p>Last night I met a whole lot of beautiful people who have been YOUs on
the TV show &ldquo;What are YOU doing in Japan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I connected most with Cyrus the wild man, who loves onsen and
apparently lives off grid.</p>

<p>The TV mysteriously broke while I was in OZ and Lin got a new one that
supports Netflix, not just Hulu which we&rsquo;ve liked for a long while,
(and others we never used).</p>

<p>Netflix is hella better than Hulu.</p>

<ol>
<li>can pause movies for a while without the stream being disconnected</li>
<li>can fast forward and reverse with great control</li>
<li>can see thumbnails larger than a postage stamp</li>
<li>can see titles and descriptions in English</li>
<li>can rate movies</li>
<li>can get movie recommendations per different profile</li>
<li>seems like a lot more variety of things to watch</li>
<li>5% less expensive</li>
</ol>

<p>Just turned on <em>Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</em>, and realize I&rsquo;ve
never seen it before!</p>

<pre><code>Thank you for the lesson notes!

Here is a link to the episode where I was originally interviewed
(you saw this on TV already)

https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3tm778_160222-y

Starting about 2 minutes into the video, you can see me act
unnatural on camera!!  ;-)

Saturday was fantastic!  I met them at the clock in Kawasaki
station, but they are not allowed to film on JR property, so we
went outside to film the greeting.

We walked to my house (30 minutes) and I showed them in detail
some of the different sidewalk / street surfaces, from red brick
cobblestone to decorative tiles, to asphalt of varying grades.

We bought bananas at my favorite local mom and pop fruit stand &quot;は
しもと&quot; (they use hiragana, not kanji on their sign) where the
wife spoke a bit about me.  It was funny that at the end she said
分からない、ね?  referring to me, though I had understood more
than she might think.

They watched me wash my feet at home (my ritual when I get back to
the house) and then I showed them my art and a couple of things
including where I do programming work (so you'll probably get to
see my messy desk!)

We went out to the park across the street where there were two
young girls on the swings.  They were like, &quot;are we on TV??&quot; and
hid their faces at first.  The crew filmed me climbing on the
playground equipment, and after the kids warmed up to us, we got
to play follow the leader, tag, and &quot;vending machine&quot;, which was a
new game for me!  I'll explain it in our lesson because I think it
will be too confusing to explain in text.

After a couple hours (?) in the park, we went inside to do foot
washing again, then took a break for lunch and for me to get ready
for Jack and Betty lesson!  I dressed up in suit, tie and barefoot
to walk to the lesson, and then put on shoes just before going
inside.  I wouldn't normally do that in a suit, but the director
requested it because it looked more interesting!

They interviewed Kayoko a bit before the lesson, and then filmed
me actually teaching the lesson..  (I think it went okay!)  We
ended up focusing on a couple of vocabulary words &quot;eye opening&quot;
and something else, and the -ing vs -ed ending of words which we
just did in Akihabara!

After the simultaneous filming, teaching, and delicious lunch, we
went back outside and I took my shoes off.  Then we re-filmed the
arrival at Jack and Betty School.  (more lies for the camera!!)  I
just showed + introduced the school at the sign, walked up the
stairs and put my shoes on before the lesson. We did not go back
inside again.

Walked back to my house, got quickly dressed for the beach, then
took the bus down to Kawasaki and Tokaido line to Chigasaki!  I
drew some of my art on the train and we did a quick interview
outside Chigasaki station before walking to the beach!

My dear friend Soness met us there; she brought her hula hoop and
some rice-cooker-made banana chocolate cake!  She showed me how to
hula hoop, and surprisingly enough, I was able to do it for more
than 1 second!  We sang the refrain from Ashkon's song Round Like
a Hula Hoop.

Lots of rock hopping, interviews about men's group work, and fun
fun fun before taxi back to Chigasaki station and Shonan-Shinjuku
Line to The Pink Cow in Roppongi!  Lin and some of our dear
friends were there (camera crew and I arrived late) and we had
yummy burritos and a very quick interview on camera about the
wonderful Pink Cow!

We chat chat chatted for a couple hours before Lin drove me and
camera crew to our house for the &quot;introduce my wife&quot; interview,
where we pretended it was 9:45am and they had just arrived at my
house for the first time!  Lin's mom was asleep, so we had to
modify another little interview where they asked if I have any
shoes at all.  I got them from my room as if they aren't always in
the 玄関!  (more and more lies for the camera!)

Then we said HI to our cat Jennie (not on camera), had some tea and bade them farewell after a long day of filming!

I'm happy to answer any questions on Thursday!

- Rob!

<p>Yay!  Upon our arrival in Narita, though Lin declined to be on camera,
the guys from Tokyo TV interviewed me again!  Fun!  I wonder if
they&rsquo;ll actually follow me around at some point.. I imagine that would
be a really interesting experience!</p>

<p>Okay so when I got back from OZ, upon arrival in Narita, I was
approached by a TV crew who asked why I was barefoot and why I was
coming to Japan.</p>

<p>I wish I had just been honest, but I told them what I <em>wished</em> I was
doing: traveling barefoot around the country for 3+ months.  They were
like, &ldquo;wow so can we follow you around?&rdquo; I was caught in my lie!  I
would <em>LOVE</em> for you to come follow me around Japan, if only I were
going to travel around Japan!</p>

<p>Dammit, so I kept the lie going, &ldquo;um, no, um because it&rsquo;s difficult um
because if I&rsquo;m on camera I might not act natural.&rdquo;  (true, see? here
I am lying because of the camera)</p>

<p>They said okay and asked if they could see the bottom of my feet.  No
worries.</p>

<p>Okay, so bye!  and I walked away, assuming the camera was watching me,
I didn&rsquo;t look back until I got out of sight.</p>

<p>Okay, so they got their footage (hehe), but now I gotta go confess.  I
went back up the escalator and found them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, um, so I lied because I thought it would sound good on TV.  I
actually live in Japan and have lived here for 12 years, but yes, I
often go around barefoot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I started composing a reply, but before I could get to an internet connection, he wrote again:</p>

<pre><code>Sorry for mailing you again.  In the airing, we keep the fact that
you live in Japan secret until the end of the airing.  (&quot;the end
of the airing&quot; means &quot;the scene you come back to our clew to
explain your living in Japan&quot;) So, the picture should be taken in
the U.S or, if taken in Japan, the background of the pictures is
not Japanese like.  Do you have pics like that??
</code></pre>

<p>I replied naively</p>

<pre><code>Hmmm; I might have some, but I'm not sure.  My wife and I are
going to the US in late January, so I can take those types of
pictures in the US and send them to you by February 1.

I'd be happy to do another interview on camera, or even have your
camera crew with me for a day in my actual normal life.  We could
go somewhere fun like Yomiuri Land, or Korakuen.. or somewhere
normal like Yoyogi Park or Meiji Jingu.

As a start, we could simply go to a shrine for New Year's Eve this
coming Thursday night if you like.

You can interview my wife about my bare feet as well.
</code></pre>

<p>And he replied as follows.  (Of course they already have plans for new years!)</p>

<pre><code>Thank you so much for your reply.  The airing will be Jan. 25th,
and I'm glad if you send them before the date of airing.  So, the
picture is to be taken in Japan if you don't have one taken in the
U.S.  I think pictures of you in Yoyogi park or somewhere in the
street can be either way to be taken in U.S or Japan.  (Like you
sitting on the bench, or walking on the street)

As for another filming, it could be true if we meet up in the
airport again.  In the New Year's Eve, we are going to Comic
market and film OTAKU foreigners.  So, please wait until next
year.
