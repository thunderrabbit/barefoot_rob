<p class=date>9pm ish</p>

<p>Bryn and I were sitting next to one another looking at her pictures
of London and Paris when the lights went out as we were beckoned to
the mass wedding.</p>

<p>Not an *actual* wedding, but an invitation for each person to honor
others in friendship - these incredible bonds that YRUU makes
possible.</p>

<p>This activity started in Plano a few years ago, and they had an
anniversary each year afterward.  Since YRUU has such a high turnover
rate, most youth here now weren't at the original event, making
anniversaries a bit silly, so this year, another mass wedding.</p>

<p>I really wanted to marry Bryn, but didn't know if we would be
interrupted by other youth who wanted to marry me, or, and this was my
greater expectation, that many people would want to marry Bryn.</p>

<p>Then we were in the circle and Bryn asked if I would marry her.
"It would be my greatest pleasure," I smiled.</p>

<p>Doug Strong introduced the ceremony, then invited individuals who were
marrying themselves to place left arm on right shoulder and right arm on
left shoulder.</p>

<p>Pairs of people were invited to put one hand on each others
shoulder, and groups of people to form a group hug.  Then people who
intended to marry everyone come to the middle into the light.</p>

<p>Bryn and I faced each other with hands on shoulders and were
approached by Mike and Lisa to be a foursome.  Bryn looked to me,
asking with her eyes.  I was all, "ummmememrrr," keeping my hands on
Bryn's shoulders.  It was so hard to turn them down, and I certainly
didn't do it cleanly, but we remained a couple and Mike and Lisa
joined the marry-everyone group when that option was offered.  (*)</p>

<p>Doug invited us to share with one another our passions.</p>

<p>"Travel, Dance, Painting, YRUU, smiles," me.</p>

<p>"Travel, family, love...," she.</p>

<p>We all had been given inexpensive little gold rings.  When
instructed, Bryn put hers on my left pinky finger.  I chose her right
ring finger, though both her ring fingers sported rings already.  Some
more words from Doug and then, "I now pronounce you married!"</p>

<p>And we hugged so big and I just started to cry.</p>

<p>"Are you laughing?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Cried cried so much passion for Bryn and life and love and for five
incredible years of knowing, loving, supporting, encouraging, teaching
each other..</p>

<p>Bryn began to cry as well.  Gentle sobs and tears.  She was all,
"Thank you for the last five years...." and then, "you have been the
only person who has been here for me the entire time."  more precious
tears from each of us.</p>

<p>It has been my utmost pleasure to be here for you Bryn.  Then I was
all, "in the past year it has become perfectly clear to me that I have
been in YRUU for you."</p>

<p>Huge tears from Bryn.  Huge huge tears and sobs.  So thankful to be
perfectly here for Bryn.</p>

<p>I chose not to say anything about having been at Emerson YRUU
specifically for Jon.  This is Bryn's moment.  My moment with Bryn.  I love
you love you so much.</p>

<p>We had held each other tightly for already five minutes at this
point, and for easily ten more as we just cried.  My tears completed
and I just held my dear Bryn to capture this moment clearly in my
heart and mind for all eternity.</p>

<p>Re-structured our hug so I was on her level.  More huge hugs.</p>

<p>People came up to me and Bryn are you okay?  "Yes" and (thumbs up)
and Simon wanted to hug Bryn cause she was crying.. and he innocently
asked what was wrong.</p>

<p>I answered.  "This has been like me and Bryn's Senior circle We are
leaving YRUU soon, and have enjoyed five incredible years together.
Bryn is going to school in August, and next year I'm going to
Japan."</p>

<p>Simon was all, "no; you can't leave!"</p>

<p>"You'll go too," I hugged him bigly.  "Anywhere you want, you can
go."</p>

<p>Later, Ian was all, "thank you for being so awesome at Fort Worth
Rally."</p>

<p>I thanked him for the blessing and the opportunity to be there for
him. </p>

<p><img src='/images/rob/wL-ROB.gif'/></p>

<h2 id="march-2015">March 2015</h2>

<p>(*) I still sometimes think about turning them down.  I&rsquo;m sorry I was
so selfish and wish I could go back to that moment and include them as
well.</p>

Brynsies!

So great that you got your flight; thanks for letting me know. :-)

I hear ya about being super busy; I have been AS well, and after two days of
not a lot of work, I'm about to get movin and groovin to get some stuff done
around here.  I have mostly gotten my sleep back inline with this timezone.
Lee-eh was so funny last night, she said I have to "reset my brain watch"
and I was all, "????" and then "oh!  internal clock!!"   So funny!


I have done a bit of research on Japan, and found a testimonial site that
gives some presumably good sound info on what it takes to "make it" there as
a teacher.  Step 1 is bring $5000, or at least to be prepared to spend 5 Gs
to get set up.  Lee-eh confirmed that last night when I talked to her about
it, so I'm leaning more toward accepting her offer of accomodations with her
fam when I arrive!

Thank you for taking the time to write.  It makes me feel loved, and I
smiled bigly to be greeted with this email today.  :-)

I love you!!

    - Rob!

oh!!  Thanks for the birthday wishes!  I didn't celebrate, but a few people
called me even so.  Maggie called to wish me a happy 11668th day (I think)
Heehee!  she's so great.   I'm looking forward to my 12000th day on 31
January 2003!!!  Whoohooooo!!

Rob,

sorry I haven't written or called, life has beAn
pretty hectic for me the last couple days and I am
only taking a short break from writing to send you an
email (i haven't even written Vessy since i've beAn
home!)

i caught my flight and made it home safely.  i have
only beAn offered $4000 a year at Richmond when is
hardly enough, so i am trying to persuade them into
giving me more, but for now i am still planning on
making it my new home.

i got my pictures developed, some are good, some are
bad, but they are all fun!  i will try to bring the
best ones to plano so you can see them too!

have you caught up on your sleep yet?  i haven't had
much time to, but i will, i'm sure!  how was your
birthday?  i hope it was great!  i wanted to call you
but i didn't get home til late last night and i didn't
have a chance :(!  but know that i was thinking about
you all day!

i am going to definitely be at plano if only for the
sake of presenting the yac restructuring resolution.
hopefully YAC will support us, but anyways, i will see
you there!

thank you so much for going with me to Europe, i had
such a great time, and every experience was so
amazing!  What an awesome adventure!  I still haven't
heard from Graham, but i assume he got our note and is
still breathing?!

anyways, i need to get back to writing but thanks
again, so much!

i love you heaps!

you are a great great friend to me and you will always
be in my life!

smiles and love,
me

<p>Hey Rob!</p>

<p>I finished &ldquo;Way of the Peaceful Warrior&rdquo; yesterday
with tears in my eyes on a plane en route to
California.  So i am here now visiting my mother&rsquo;s
parents and my aunt.  good fun.  But i have an
<em>amazing</em> story to tell you!</p>

<p>So tonight my mom, sister, aunt, and I all went to eat
sea food at our favorite seafood spot in So.Cal, Dana
Point.  Good fun after not having seafood in 5 months.
 After dinner we were walking along the pier looking
at the lights on the boats and my aunt said something
about some form of Tai Chi that she does.</p>

<p>Extremely randomly I asked, &ldquo;Susan, do you know who
Dan Millman is?&rdquo; and her initial response was, &ldquo;Yea,
he was in my English class at Berkeley.&rdquo; Inside i went,
&ldquo;wow!&rdquo; outside I said, &ldquo;really?  I just finished
reading one of his books all about his time at
berkeley!&rdquo; to which she said, &ldquo;about that guy in the
gas station?  yeah, i&rsquo;ve beAn to a lot of his book
signings, our paths cross a lot, though he was never
in class cause he was always out doing gymnastics
meets.  after he got back from isreal he said, &lsquo;even
the street cleaners are jewish!!&lsquo;he was a funny guy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>so!  what a small world it is!  yesterday i finish
reading this amazing book and today my aunt has gone
to school with the author!  and apparently she sees
him all the time!  she offered and suggested that she
take my book to get it signed!  i feel bad because i
have underlined and written in the margins on multiple
pages, but i think it would be great!  i just think
its an amazing example of the size of this crazy world
and i wanted to thank you for introducing me to a
great story.</p>

<p>so thats my super story for the evening and i hope it
makes you smile.  also, the book shares the feelings
of Dan in his unhappy marriage, and it reaffirms my
support for your break with Wende.  I think,
spiritually, it was the best thing for both of you, in
the long run.  You should re-read the book.</p>

<p>Smiles and Love,</p>

<p>Brynsies</p>

                        <p>Remember the loving feeling of wanting so much for Bryn to feel
comfortable with her decision about whether or not to attend ACT class
tomorrow in the AM (in 3 hours or so) maybe 5 hours.  Hug hug hug and
just so much love expressed for her.  I Love You sign as I said bye to
her.  She was on the phone in the kitchen and I left for bed.</p>

<p class=date>12:19pm Saturday 27 October 2001</p>

<p>Absolutely precious when I talked to Bryn deep meaningful
convesation where she queried me about relationship with Wende and i
answered as best I could.</p>

<p>She told me about her feelings and sadness lately since she&rsquo;s been
back in USA and stuff.  Seems that one of her life&rsquo;s greatest fears is
having people leave her.  I felt so belssed by her precious tears; I
know it is difficult for Bryn to cry in front of others.</p>

<p>Bryn and I talked all the way until the entire rally was leaving
for Social Action.  So blessed I felt getting to hang out with her
even longer.</p>

<p class="message">Hello Rob.  We are at Irene and Nick's wedding
reception.  i can't remember the last one of these i attended but it
must have beAn quite some time ago.  it is super dark in here.
anyways, i love nick's smile (as i have expressed and wish for you to
remeber) and irene is so beautiful and their happiness in an odd way
definitely inspires me.  who knows when these same rituals will be
performed in my honor, but i await them excitedly.  anyways, i hope
you are having as good a time as everyone else and especially me.
smiles.  brynsies</p>

<p>what about a greek wedding?</p>

<p class="message">a greek wedding is an amazing way to see a different
culture in action.  i feel privileged to have gotten to experience
this, especially with you and wende.  When else would i have ever had
a chance like this?  this is OZsome.</p>

<p>We definitely are blessed to experience such a cultural event.
Hanging out with you in OZ has beAn beyond incredible!!</p>

<p class="message">Truue!  It is hard to believe it is real but i think
before anything when i think 'Melbourne with R& W' i will think of
sitting at the park outside Luna Park and looking at the birds and
playing with the devil sticks and walking and being happy.  that was
so nice and good and memorable.  i can't describe my plethora of
emotions but i know that part of me is definitely noticing the changes
in 'me' since i have beAn in oz because of my interactions with
someone from back home.  i compare my old self with rob and then think
about 'newer me' interacting with the same rob and i am amazed at how
i have changed, for better or for worse.  you are helping me to see
those changes.  i definitely thank you for that.</p>

<p class="message">Heaps better.  You are growing indescribably mature
and I'm so proud of you and honored to be part of your life.  I
believe that by traveling the world, you are experiencing SO MANY
different cultures and things that you really get to define who *you*
are amidst all the everything.  We met a barefoot man who had thin
flipflops and apparently makes a living making and performing with and
selling devil sticks.  You now have the choice of doing that for part
of your life.</p>

<p>You are experiencing a Greek wedding.  Now this gives you a sense
of what it might be like to marry a greek god of a man (at least the
weding part but)</p>

<p>You are meeting millions of peep from different countries and you
are welcome to visit many of them whenever you visit their country.
You see their culture and traditions and language and can incorporate
those into your life.</p>

<p class="message">truue, but my cynicism for life (and horror movies)
has become a very big pessimistic part of my life
which i attribute to my leaving home just a bit too
soon.  c'est la vie.  i will learn.</p>

<p>Over the past three-ish years, i have met many people
and done many things unlike any of my dreams.  through
all of these things, one person has always suported
me, always comforted me, and always brought so much
light to my life.  rob, you&rsquo;ve beAn so incredible.
thank you for being my friend.  when i think of not
seeing you for VERY long times, it&rsquo;s super sad.  it
hasn&rsquo;t hit me yet that tomorrow could be our last hug
for long times.  i know you will keep in touch, but i
will none the less miss you.   smile always, and
remember that silent football only requires two
people.</p>

<p>love always,
Brynny Pooh</p>
