<p>Interesting to talk about the Meisner effect and flux pinning at SCC
today.  I have always assumed I understand the meaning based on the
English presentation, but I felt a bit unsure when I was breaking it
down in detail for Yasu as he was practicing his explanation of the
same.</p>

<p>My understanding: when a superconductor is below its critical
temperature it pushes (almost) all magnetic flux out of itself.  This
is the Meisner effect, apparently named after a scientist named
Meisner.</p>

<p>Impurities in the superconductor mean some lines of magnetic flux
pierce the superconductor and the superconductor &ldquo;remembers&rdquo; the
strength and direction of those lines and pins itself to them.  This
is called flux pinning, apparently not named after a scientist.</p>

<p>What is this &ldquo;memory&rdquo;?  I guess while the material is not a
superconductor, magnetic flux pierces it like any other non-ferrous
material.  As it becomes superconducting as it passes below its
critical temperature the flux already passing through it are&hellip; what
exactly?</p>

<p>(( I wonder if electrical resistance in normal conductors is what
causes the magnetic fields???  hmmm ))</p>

<p class=date>My trip to Ink's Lake - Mar. 22 - Mar. 27, 1987</p>

<p>It was to be a fun trip.  We were going to go to Ink&rsquo;s lake, go
spelunking, canoing, rappelling, climbing, and a whole bunch of fun
stuff.  It was pretty fun. Now it is March 29, and I just relayed the
whole trip to a tape recorder.  Here&rsquo;s how it went:</p>

<p>We left Tomball, A
little late, but we left.  All our stuff was cram-packed in the back
of the bus.  I was in the furthest seat back with Wade Johnson.  We
were talkin&rsquo; and listening to tapes and stuff.. just messing around.
Then 3 of the girls decided to take a nap on our stuff.  Throughout
the trip, it got more crowded back there every day.  It was Pam,
Renae, and Beth who went back.  I&rsquo;m going to go through the trip
faster than this.</p>

<p>We rented canoes along the way; while we were
there, we chunked a little pink cloth frisbee around. We stopped for a
snack near Bastrop, and had supper at McDonalds in Austin.  I called
Christy Deans from there, well, I tried.  She wasn&rsquo;t there.  We
weren&rsquo;t too wild.  We got to Inks Lake at 7:30.  It was a perfect
night.  No clouds, No wind, nice temperature.  We unloaded and put our
stuff under a tree on a tarp where we were going to sleep.  We went
into a cabin a messed around. Mike Hurt and I were sitting with our
legs straight, then using our arms to press up into handstands.  We
all tried some stuff with a broom - put it behind your back, bring it
over your head, put one leg around your arm and back over the broom,
bring it back over your head and then step across with your other leg.
Wow!  We wold hold it and jump over it.  We did fingertip
pullups&hellip; just showin&rsquo; off.  We did that thing where you take three
foot length steps back from a wall, put your head against it, pick up
something then straighten up. keeping our legs straight.  I could do
it.  Only girls are supposed to be able to.  Beth went over to a tree
and started climbing.  Everyone followed.  We had like a line of
people climbing up and jumping off a branch.  Eventualy we all got
tired and everyone but a few people lay down under that tree. We
watched shooting stars, told stories, and jokes, we sang some.  I
played mercy with Mike Hurt.  We were perfectly matched.  We slept at
about 2:30am.</p>

<p>At 3:00 it started raining.  We all jumped up and went
to a cabin.  It started raining hard, then.  Wind was blowin&rsquo; it right
in the screen.  We were totally crammed against the wall under the
screen.  Barry then got up and got a tarp to put on the windows
outside.  The wind kept it smacked up there all nigth.  I slept O.K. -
woke up at about 8:00 &amp; took a shower (all the hot water was gone) I
froze!  The wind was still blowing making it worse.  My voice was a
little hoarse.  I went into the breakfast cabin, and helped cook.
Then we played frisbee, frisbee football, we tossed washers, we did
some double stunts - stand on someones shoulders -, played on some
see-saws, a slide, and swings.  I learned how to flip out of a swing.
Not from my back, but sitting.  The trick is to hold on to the chains
until you are rightside up.  Mike and Renae taught me how.  I did
double stunts with Pam.</p>

<p>We went on the canoe trip. I was with Mike
Hamm and Wade.  We jumped in and were cruisin&rsquo;.  Wade was humming the
theme from Hawaii 5-0.  The wind was blowin&rsquo; so hard that Pam, Beth,
Renae got dumped over. Wade and I helped them.  Then came some rapids.
Mr. Hamm told us to go through them a certain way so we wouldn&rsquo;t tip.
We said fine.  No problem.  Oh- before the rapids we had taken our
shirts off and tied them to the cross bars on the canoe.  So we went
through the first part of the rapids real easily.  Then we turned to
go down the next section, and the wind took the chance and blew us
sideways.  We took in about 6 inches of water at first, and we were
trying to keep cool (ha ha) and say no prob.  Then we had to hit a
wave and ended up about half full of water.  We were still saying&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s cool - we can do it.  Then one last time and we sank.  Wade
immediately jumped out a swam for shore.  The canoe turned over and
Mike crawled on top.  I was hanging on to the side, telling Mike it
was O.K. and trying to get used to the water.  Then I pulled our conoe
to a dock Wade had run to.  We got there, dumped it out, and were
freezin&rsquo;.  There was an old dude watching us.  It was his dock.  Then
we went across the river to where the Torgesens and Glen were.  We
tied up and waited for the others. I lay out on a rock gettin&rsquo; a tan
during that time.</p>

<p>After about another hour, everyone was there and we
played some games and told jokes.  I learned the 7 game then.  Later,
the camper got there and we chunked a football and 2 tennis balls
around.  We waited some more and then went back to camp.  Mike Hurt
and Mr. Hamm took the canoes back that afternoon.  We had supper in
Burnet.  We went to Dairy Queen to eat.  I bought a banana split and a
shake and a glass of water.  Nothing nutritious.  Then we went to buy
groceries.  I drove Mike Hurt around in a shopping cart.  We read
magazines, and messed around.  Mike juggled some things, like boxes of
raisins, or cans of peas.  We just had a good time.  I slept in the
crazy group.  Not the Ahlborns&rsquo; clan, but Glen, John, Brian, Dave,
Eric (not Shafer), and Tim.  We gambled and ate M&amp;M and crackerjacks.</p>

<p>We read Tim&rsquo;s National Enquirerer- all the STUPID things in it.  We
slept at about 12:00 and Brian and I woke at about 6:00 to get warm
showers.  It worked.  By this time, I had lost a shirt, a pair of
socks, shampoo, toothpaste, and my soap.  Oh well.  We went back to
the breakfast cabin.  Then we played in the field again - just messing
around until the Vanishing Texas River Cruise.  Each ticket was 10
bucks.  We all just layed out on the top deck and got some sleep.
Mike Hurt and I took everything off except shorts to get a tan.  We
saw some water falls, Spanish Daggers (that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in our front
yard), some Spanish goats, and some double crested Camerons.  Glen
called them Double Breasted&hellip; whatever.</p>

<p>The narrator? of the cruise
came up a few times to compliment our good behavior.  The last time we
were singing the theme from Giligan&rsquo;s Island.  Then later in the
afternoon, we went rappeling.  That was scary!  Getting over the edge
was against all instincts.  I was the first to go after Mike Hurt
did. (He was a college councilor for the trip).  We went swimming.
The wind had slowed some so it wasn&rsquo;t too bad.</p>

<p>We had supper in
Burnet again.  this time at Mr. Gatti&rsquo;s.  We were getting a little
wild here, but not too bad.  I had one piece of Eric Shafer&rsquo;s Pizza,
and I bought some cinamon bread sticks.  I was the last to order
anything and Brian and I were the last people in there.  We were
talking to the girl working there.  She had blonde hair and looked
like that girl on &ldquo;Heart of the City.&rdquo;  She was really pretty.  then
we crusied back to the camp.</p>

<p>I was in the crazy group again.  We were
messin&rsquo; around outside.  We threw rocks at the Alhborns&rsquo; group&rsquo;s
cabin.  Glen pissed in a can of Dr. Pepper and threw it on the roof.
Then we played Gastapo until about 12:30.  I slept outside with Eric
Shafer, Gary Picou, Mike hurt, Mike Hamm, and me.  I woke up, showered
(warm) and went to the breakfast cabin.  I asked Mr. Cowan what day it
was, and he said &ldquo;Wednesday the 25th.&rdquo;  If he hadn&rsquo;t said &ldquo;25th&rdquo; I
would not have remembered my B-day.</p>

<p>That day we went to West Cave and
Enchanted rock.  West Cave was neat.  We went down into a canyon by a
river.  We followed a little creek upstream to a horseshoe shaped
waterfall.  You could walk under the horseshoe behind the waterfall.
On one side of the HorseShoe, the water had fallen for so long
(100,000 yrs.) that a curtain of rock was formed, creating a cave.  It
was truly awesome. Then we went to Enchanted Rock.  On the way we
stopped at another horseshoe shaped falls.  This one was bigger,
though, and much prettier.  The water was <em><b>crystal</b></em> blue.  So
beautiful!!!</p>

<p>We ate lunch there.  I sat with Renae, Pam, Beth, Allan,
and Wade.  Renae dropped her apple into the water twice.  I walked
aroud behind the waterfall, where Carl was.  Then we all went back and
finished our trip to Enchanted Rock.  Enchanted R. was great.  I did a
crack climb with Mr. Hamm, a friction climb with Mr. Cowan, and tried
Ben&rsquo;s Climb.  Mr. Hamms climb was easy when you figured out how to put
your feet and hands to brace right.  Mr. Cowan&rsquo;s was easy for me.  I
just kept clawing around for a grip with my hands.  Ben&rsquo;s Climb was
tough!  Only Beth and Mike Hurt could do it.  Barry couldn&rsquo;t ven.  I
tried hard though, and got some good scratches trying, but nope.  I
was unable to form a fist in a certain crack to pull myself up with,
and Mike was not there to show me another way.  But, it was a noble
effort.</p>

<p>We went to Dairy Queen that night for supper.  the girl
working there asked us for our name when we ordered to make it more
personal. I said Ted for my name.  I got a hamburger and water and a
blizzard with M&amp;M&rsquo;s in it.  Brian got cold fajitas.  That was funny.
Later I went up there with Dave and ordered a blizzard.  We went down
the whole list, rejecting each item that was offered to put in it.
Then I said, &ldquo;How &lsquo;bout French Fries?&rdquo;  the girl sorta grossed out
then said sure.  I decided not, although everyone said Goforit!  I
just got M&amp;Ms again.</p>

<p>We went to camp after that and slept, got up the
next morning, took showers, and left for Waco.  We at breakfast and
McD&rsquo;s.  We were fairly wild then.  I got about 12 straws.  We played
outside some and then continued on.  We got to Waco, stopped had lunch
and then went to the palentelogical dig site.  There were bones of 15
mammoths there.  They all died right together.  We were trying to
figure out how they may have died.  Flood, Smoke, hunters, Lightning.
The Alhborn&rsquo;s thought of lightning.  Actually I did too, but I didn&rsquo;t
say anything because no one would have believed me.  Lightning
happened to be the guys&rsquo; favorite theory too.  Then he took us to a
big pit where there were a whole bunch of fossils.  Including shells,
shark teeth, starfish parts, and other things. I found a ski rope for
cave men, a broken Egyption compact disk, a skeleton of a Hobbit (I
didn&rsquo;t touch it because it was a grave), solid gold coins (too heavy
to carry), a complete shark skeleton (it was buried so I couldn&rsquo;t dig
it up), and a pteredactyl (it flew away).  So I didn&rsquo;t come back with
much to show for my finds.  Oh Yeah- a piece of the Rosetta Stone (it
fell out of a hole in my pocket) Oh, well.</p>

<p>We went to Mother Neff
that evening.  We played the ABC game along the way.  I helped cook
ribs with Mike Hurt that night.  I slept with the Alhborns&rsquo; group
again that night. I learned how to play murder and I got to talk to
Beth some and got to know her which was nice.  We heard some noises
that sounded like thunder.  It turned out to be a nearby military base
going through a simulation.  &ldquo;Playing Gastapo&rdquo; as I put it.  We got to
sleep-in the next morning.  We were going home that day, and we didn&rsquo;t
have to hurry.  There was plenty of hot water for showers.  There were
only 2 showers though.  Barry and I were in the shower part of the
bathroom at the same time.  We sang Lean On Me, and the national
anthem.  Wade and the Torgesens were bangin&rsquo; on the door to tell us to
hurry.</p>

<p>After that we ate breakfast and played washers.  I took some
pictures, and played frisbee.  John, Glen and I got a frisbee triangle
going.  Then we left.  We played the ABC game.  Only Me Glen John and
Tim made it all the way through.  Our list was, Australo-Burilicus,
Beer, Carmeron, Deoxyribonucleic acid, Elephantitis, Financial
advisor, Ganglion, Hypogryph, Intestinal gas flareup, Jumping Jack,
Kilomanjaro, Lopsa-apa, Mucus membranes, Nasal passages, Orthodontist,
Pathalogical Rapist, Quackological speech therapist, Reggae,
Supercalifragilisticexpialidoches, Thermo-molecular cumulo-rhumbic
with a linear postulation in section four on the left hand side,
Urinary passage, Vortices, Winnie the Pooh, Xenophobic nightmares,
Yugoslavian barbaric eras of time, and Zambia.  Pretty awesome, huh?</p>

<p>We went crazy at McD&rsquo;s.  We all ordered from one register, about
$70. I got a Big Mac, a hamburger, ice water, ice cream cone, apple
pie, and a medium Dr. Pepper.  Then I went back for a shake and
another pie.  I made off with about 25 straws from there.  Then it was
sleep for me until I got home.  I got everything back except
toothpaste, which I had left at home.  Dave got Mike Hurt&rsquo;s address.
Mike said we should plan a trip to Enchanted Rock.  He said he and a
friend could take about 8 of us.  I hope I can go.  Tim&rsquo;s mom took me
and Dave home, and that&rsquo;s it.  It was fun. We got home Friday- of
course.  I told Fred some of my jokes.  I think I&rsquo;m going to reserve
some pages in here for jokes and stories.  They may be the first pages
listed in my table of contents.</p>
