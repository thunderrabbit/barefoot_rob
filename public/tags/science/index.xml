      <description>16:58 Thursday 11 July 2019 JST Interesting to talk about the Meisner effect and flux pinning at SCC today. I have always assumed I understand the meaning based on the English presentation, but I felt a bit unsure when I was breaking it down in detail for Yasu as he was practicing his explanation of the same.
My understanding: when a superconductor is below its critical temperature it pushes (almost) all magnetic flux out of itself.</description>
