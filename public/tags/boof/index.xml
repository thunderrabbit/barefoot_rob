      <description>21:17 Saturday 17 February 2018 JST After work today, Lin and I met at the station and as a little &amp;ldquo;romantic&amp;rdquo; gift, I bought reserved seats so we could take Romance Car to our station. It was nice to just be able to relax all the way home. Curiously, when Lin tried to pay for my bus fare, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go through so the driver just let us on the bus free.</description>

大風呂 (hot baths) were nice! I heard Lin and Rohini and I boofed for Lin, but she didn&amp;rsquo;t hear me. (weird)
We&amp;rsquo;re about to put on warm clothes and head out to the field.
###(written 15:32 Sunday 23 November 2014 JST)
Turns out Lin did hear me! She was like, &amp;ldquo;I hear Rob!&amp;rdquo; and said Hellooo but Rohini was like, &amp;ldquo;Rob said he wasn&amp;rsquo;t coming,&amp;rdquo; so Lin didn&amp;rsquo;t pursue it.</description>
