      <description>11:37 Tuesday 19 September 2017 JST Yeah so I ate too much yesterday and planned to fast today. But Letterman appeared and ripped the E from his sweater and Tariq took me to brunch after our lesson. I walked too close to my next lesson and was spotted so now I am at B where I will teach at 2pm, about to chow their scrumptious lunch. Oh, and all of this was after I discovered the lunch delivery was not cancelled yesterday for the holiday.</description>
