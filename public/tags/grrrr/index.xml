      <description>23:10 Monday 13 July 2015 JST RANT I fucking hate when people won&amp;rsquo;t do things logically. Feel hot after taking a shower? Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because the water is hot. You think you&amp;rsquo;re going to get sick because you use cool water during the shower? Oh you think hot water makes you cleaner? Why turn on scalding water and then turn on freezing AC to offset the heat when cool water is an option and we have a fucking typhoon sending plenty of breezes which would come in if you&amp;rsquo;d fucking open the curtains and put my fucking quilt outside if you&amp;rsquo;re afraid the three people across the balcony are going to be peering inside our house while they&amp;rsquo;re inside huddled around their own AC.</description>
