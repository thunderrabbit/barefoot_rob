      <description>08:37 Friday 24 November 2017 JST I just uploaded the video that I took yesterday. At this moment, the vertical bar is cut, but I have not taken the photo for that cut. The green guy has swiped his sword, and I cut the bar, but.. let&amp;rsquo;s just say they are not poised for the shot.
 
  Since June 2017, I have spent 4.444 4.4+ days so far on Marble Track 3.</description>
