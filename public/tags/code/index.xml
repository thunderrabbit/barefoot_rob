For the md5 count thing, /u/Thespoian gave me a brilliant insite. Whereas I had been trying to go through all the combinations of uppercase/lowercase, first recursively, then with a &amp;ldquo;brillian&amp;rdquo; bitshifting method, he had just been randomly selecting letters and changing their case pseudorandomly.
I was going for user-friendly GUI. My way (written in Javascript,) was bloated, slow and often locked up Chrome. He was going for getrdone.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not really going mad, but I realize the code I am trying to write for the MD5 count thing is like a madlib. I want to take a string and replace tokens with example words.
Only difference: I want to do a combination of all the options. Essentially
foreach adjective in my list of adjectives: for each noun in my list of nouns: fill in the adjective and noun in template  So I end up with length-adjectives * length-nouns sentences, each of which I will md5 and see if it can work for the next MD5 count.</description>

I made a subsite today for AB website.
Not quite finished yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s basically a subset of the AB site, but uses the same login system.</description>

On the way home from Charu and Toru&amp;rsquo;s house now. Lin is sleeping beside me because her phone is dead (because I used a lot of its battery power to have Wifi while at their house).
I&amp;rsquo;m adding some not-very-extendable code to the md5 cheater thing: it will allow selecting which characters to convert. It&amp;rsquo;s not extendable because I&amp;rsquo;ve just hard coded three sets:</description>
