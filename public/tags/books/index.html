<p><strong>10:09pm Thursday 28 March 2013</strong></p>

<p>Theodore the Crow was hungry. It was cold and he had no where to go.
Then he saw a light in the window of a cabin far way. He flew toward
it and landed outside the window, wondering how he could get inside.
He pecked on the window to get the attention of the man sleeping
inside, but the man had just finished another flagon of ale and
wouldn&rsquo;t stir until nature called in the morning. Theodore was
content to wait; the window was a bit warmer than outside, and he had
no where else to go.</p>

<p>Cindy the Cat saw Theodore&rsquo;s silhouette in the window. She thought,
&lsquo;mmmm dinner will be nice&rsquo; and stalked Theodore with the intent of
eating him. Theodore didn&rsquo;t hear anything as she crept silently
toward him. By chance, he thought he felt someone looking at him, and
turned around just as Cindy was within swatting distance.</p>

<p>Theodore, though cold and hungry, was a sharp witted crow. &ldquo;Hello,
there!&rdquo; said Theodore happily. &ldquo;Did you come here to get out of the
cold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cindy looked surprised for a moment, &ldquo;no actually,&rdquo; she started. &ldquo;I
came to eat you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To meet me?&rdquo; the crow lied. &ldquo;How very sweet! My name is Theodore; what&rsquo;s
your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not wanting to be rude to food, Cindy answered plainly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Cindy,&rdquo; and
paused, then added &ldquo;nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s so good to meet you too!&rdquo; laughed Theodore. I&rsquo;ve not met a
cat in many years. I just delight at seeing what incredible sense of
balance you have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? You can balance on a thin wire; I can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; agreed Theodore, &ldquo;but I have to use my wings to
balance, but you don&rsquo;t have any wings!&rdquo; With that, Theodore leapt up
into the air and flew toward the beams supporting the porch roof.
Cindy was much quicker, though, and caught him in mid flight.</p>

<p>Nom nom nom.</p>

<p><strong>9:45pm Thursday 28 March 2013</strong></p>

<p>A snake named Jeff was sleeping outside in the sun. He enjoyed the
nice breeze and white clouds floating softly in the sky. Then he saw a
cloud that looked just like an angel! He followed it as far as he
could, but then reached the sea and could travel no further. &ldquo;Oh no!
How will i catch the angel?&rdquo; he cried. Then he spotted a dolphin
splashing and leaping from the water. &ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; yelled Jeff, &ldquo;can
you carry me toward that angel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dolphin said, &ldquo;certainly! but you have to give me something
first!&rdquo; Snake didn&rsquo;t have much time so he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time
now, but I&rsquo;ll give you two things later!&rdquo; The dolphin said, &ldquo;okay;
that sounds good. Come slide onto my back!&rdquo; and off they went.</p>

<p>The dolphin was a very fast swimmer and caught up with the cloud
quickly. By that time it had turned into more of a blob, so Jeff was
disappointed. &ldquo;Well, I will give you two things. First, I&rsquo;ll name the
blob cloud after you. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; The dolphin said, &ldquo;my name is
Harriet. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jeff,&rdquo; said Jeff. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet
you!&rdquo; they said together.</p>

<p>Harriet carried Jeff back to the dock while Jeff tried to think of
another thing to give Harriet. They arrived at the dock and Jeff
realized what to give Harriet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not ready yet, but come back in
one week, and I&rsquo;ll give you something!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet figured Jeff would not be there, but she came back to the dock
a week later. Jeff was looking quite clean! He was carrying a small
bag which he gave to Harriet. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s inside?&rdquo; asked Harriet
excitedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a part of me,&rdquo; replied Jeff. &ldquo;Oh my god, it&rsquo;s your
skin! That&rsquo;s so gross and cool at the same time!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet had never seen snake skin before, but she had heard of it.
Now she could show her friends!</p>

<p>Completely wonderful story.</p>

<p>I loved the ironies in narration, like, &ldquo;the experience itself was different than that of our imaginations, where we sunned ourselves with fat bellies after the picnic like lions on the Savannah, then tottered home under the glorious painting presented by the Heavens in the evening. We died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed several times.</p>

<p>I want so much for the story to be true. It truly does prove the courage of life can overcome astonishing adversity.</p>

<p>I cried twice near the end.</p>

<p>How funny to see me working so hard to write this description. <em>Life of Pi</em> rules.</p>
