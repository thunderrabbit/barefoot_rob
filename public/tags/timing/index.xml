      <description>15:45 Tuesday 11 June 2019 JST I walked gently toward our station while repeating the lesson for today. I included &amp;ldquo;I am determined to see time differently&amp;rdquo; an was intrigued as I walked past a man who was walking slowly; it felt right / fine to do so.
Arrived at the train station and just missed the local train, but whatdya know the next train was a Hakone Limited Express (or something) and the next stop is Shinjuku, and I got a seat (for 410 yen).</description>

      <description>21:26 Sunday 09 June 2019 JST Headed to the station I realized I had left my wallet etc at the workshop location.
Great timing to find them before they got across the street and out of site. Rin let me back in and discovered some of the lights were still on so she got a chance to turn them off. Perfect synchronicity again.</description>
