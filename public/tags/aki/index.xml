      <description>19:03 Sunday 17 June 2018 JST Went to SOGO with everyone and then Cookie Time with Aki, but the line was too long for her so we bounced. Said bye to her at the station and then went back for cookies! Bought a shake, but it was more like blended milk than blended ice cream. Bought a lemon cookie for Lin and headed home.
&amp;ldquo;Oh I forgot my water bottle&amp;rdquo; so I headed back to the park and saw Menya and them leaving the park.</description>

      <description>20:58 Sunday 09 July 2017 JST I joined Lin who met her co-workers in Kamakura for a going away party for one of the managers. Aki had a Canon film camera with a short little lens, so I offered to give her the slightly longer lens that came with my Canon EOS.</description>
