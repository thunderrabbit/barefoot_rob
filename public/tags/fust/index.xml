      <description>07:35 Thursday 21 February 2019 JST Marble Track 3 is not my #1 priority; I am happy to work on it slowly.
*) Rewriting in Gatsby / React makes sense if I can learn along the path to creating it. How do you feel about going slowly, to help an old newbie learn along the way?
Basically, I do the work, learning along the way, you get a per month retainer, for minimum 5 months?</description>

      <description>20:17 Thursday 14 February 2019 JST A man named Fust has recommended a new stack for Marble Track 3: Airtable as backend, Gatsby as frontend, and some other things I have not heard of. Actually I had not heard of Gatsby.
I have an old VirtualBox sitting around so I spun it up and loaded a Gatsby demo. It pooped out a bunch of deprecation warnings, so I am loathe to really dig into this thing if it will be an ongoing battle against a bunch of deprecations ongoing during the project, as well as making the marble track itself.</description>
