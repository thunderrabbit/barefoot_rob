      <description>19:30 Friday 18 August 2017 JST This is the first time I have worked with glass. Basically melted the end of a glass rod and tacked some colors onto it after the sensei wrapped it onto some sort of ceramic to which the glass apparently won&amp;rsquo;t adhere.
Lin took pictures during the process and then when I finished was like お疲れ様です。 and I was like まだまだ and asked the sensei if I could make another.</description>
