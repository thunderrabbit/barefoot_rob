      <description>13:40 Wednesday 25 November 2015 JST JB called me this morning just after Lin and I finished meditation. &amp;ldquo;Hey can you leave right now to teach a lesson?&amp;rdquo;
I arrived a few minutes late, but the students were lovely, eager, varied, inquisitive, and several other adjectives that mean nice.
I was pinch hitting for Benny, who I know from NOVA back in the day, so I told them to ask him about &amp;ldquo;baseball loudspeaker,&amp;rdquo; a story he may have told them already, but I wanted to make sure they hear it because I think they&amp;rsquo;d enjoy it.</description>
