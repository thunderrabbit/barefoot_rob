OS X Updater detected nothin&amp;rsquo; because bah moe joe, and App Store was unable to download XCode 6.1 because harumf harumf, but I was able to download it from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=Xcode.
It&amp;rsquo;s downloading at 2.7777 MB per second according to a URL-of-the-Google calculation. But my connection pulls down at 4+ MB per second from proper CDNs.
Can&amp;rsquo;t Apple afford a proper CDN?</description>

I went to an Indian restaurant for lunch today, and was enjoying veggie curry and nan when two, ahem, people lit up cigarettes across from me in the restaurant.
I switched to gobble mode on my curry, left 80% of the nan and put on my jacket.
The manager was like, &amp;ldquo;oh would you like your tea?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;No; I gotta go. You&amp;rsquo;ve got two fuckers here smoking and it&amp;rsquo;s disgusting.</description>
