      <description>18:08 Wednesday 31 July 2019 JST Today the weather was quite lovely, so I spent some time outside repotting some baby plants that had come from Alex, who froze two winters ago.
The original Alex can be seen in the first two pics here.
     
20:12 Wednesday 31 July 2019 JST I just got super sidetracked looking for Alex pictures, after finding a journal entry with a missing image of Alex.</description>

      <description>11:58 Saturday 16 September 2017 JST I put this leaf down but before it could grow much past the pics shown here, it got cleaned up by the annual clearing done by city workers.
 
After the annual clear cut seemed to be complete, I found a spot that had not been cleared. It is still in the same park, but on a sidewalk, so maybe it will be clearcut by a different team.</description>

I broke in to my old macare (that aint right, but that&amp;rsquo;s the word that came to mind and I had to look this one up:) macrame weaving skills and went to work with 4 sets of earphones that Lin and I got from our flights to the US in January. Boom!</description>
