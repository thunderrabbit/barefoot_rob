<p>Lin and I replanted the sakura tree which we planted (too close to the
wall) last week.  There was a slight gap in the rain so we took the
chance to move the tree.</p>

<p>I was thankful I had done a careful job of packing mud and nutritious
leaves for the tree last week.  I was able to dig those up and reuse
them today.  To be honest I was a bit frustrated by the end and just
wanted to get it done, and then Lin bumped her head quite hard on the
window frame that extends out from the house.  (it sounded like a
heavy rock falling onto the ground).  I wanted her to stop working and
go inside, but she wanted to clean up the final bits of mud.</p>

<p>Most interesting about the whole thing was when Azuma-san came by and
said we didn&rsquo;t need to move it; the tree would have been fine 20cm
from the wall.  He showed us the tree near his wall as evidence.
Hmmm.  It&rsquo;s a different kind of tree, but fair enough.</p>

<p>Today Lin and I drove to Travis and Yumi&rsquo;s place to hang out with them
and Sakura.  Johan was already there and Deji came a bit later.  Nice
to see everyone again, though in some ways it&rsquo;s like the tribe is
getting smaller (and larger!)</p>

<p>No BBQ today due to rain, but we made 手巻き with chicken, eggs,
salad, and then ice cream at the end.</p>

<p>We laughed a lot, played with (funny) rubber balls, retrieved toys
from under the sofa set, and had a great time.</p>

<p>Peeps were ready to leave by the time I had to leave to get to men&rsquo;s
circle on time tonight, so Lin drove us to the station.  Driving a car
takes (unpredictably) longer than taking a train, so I took a train.</p>

<p>Deji and I sat on Yokohama line for a bit, talking about what racism
actually means.  He made a distinction between &ldquo;pre judging&rdquo; (making
predictions about someone) and &ldquo;prejuduce&rdquo; (assuming superiority over
someone).</p>

<p>Funny thing at SOGO today.  Sakura asked me how long I&rsquo;ve been in
Japan.</p>

<p>15 years.</p>

<p>She goes &ldquo;Wow, me too, almost.&rdquo;  She is 17 years old. hahaha</p>
