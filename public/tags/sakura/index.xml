      <description>18:18 Saturday 15 June 2019 JST Lin and I replanted the sakura tree which we planted (too close to the wall) last week. There was a slight gap in the rain so we took the chance to move the tree.
I was thankful I had done a careful job of packing mud and nutritious leaves for the tree last week. I was able to dig those up and reuse them today.</description>

      <description>17:39 Tuesday 30 April 2019 JST Today Lin and I drove to Travis and Yumi&amp;rsquo;s place to hang out with them and Sakura. Johan was already there and Deji came a bit later. Nice to see everyone again, though in some ways it&amp;rsquo;s like the tribe is getting smaller (and larger!)
No BBQ today due to rain, but we made 手巻き with chicken, eggs, salad, and then ice cream at the end.</description>

      <description>12:31 Monday 16 September 2018 JST Funny thing at SOGO today. Sakura asked me how long I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Japan.
15 years.
She goes &amp;ldquo;Wow, me too, almost.&amp;rdquo; She is 17 years old. hahaha</description>
