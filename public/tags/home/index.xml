      <description>23:35 Thursday 11 July 2019 JST I&amp;rsquo;m on a local train in Shinjuku which will leave in less than a minute from now. I could have taken an express train which would get to our station faster, but would not have afforded me a seat to write.
23:59 Thursday 11 July 2019 JST Just woke up in Kyodo. Soshigaya-Okura now. Super tired. Too tired to write kanji.
00:02 Friday 12 July 2019 JST Express train.</description>

      <description>18:18 Saturday 15 June 2019 JST Lin and I replanted the sakura tree which we planted (too close to the wall) last week. There was a slight gap in the rain so we took the chance to move the tree.
I was thankful I had done a careful job of packing mud and nutritious leaves for the tree last week. I was able to dig those up and reuse them today.</description>

I know the nimble cats can jump over it, but hopefully the mean heavy cats will not. There&amp;rsquo;s a small brown cat who likes to chill on our balcony. We&amp;rsquo;re not ready for three (3) cats, so haven&amp;rsquo;t let him inside. But we have been feeding him because&amp;hellip; cat!
However, there&amp;rsquo;s a big bully cat who wants the same balcony space so I blocked the small gap where they usually enter the balcony.</description>
