<p>I&rsquo;m on a local train in Shinjuku which will leave in less than a
minute from now.  I could have taken an express train which would get
to our station faster, but would not have afforded me a seat to write.</p>

<p>Just woke up in Kyodo.  Soshigaya-Okura now.  Super tired.  Too tired
to write kanji.</p>

<p>Yay I got a seat on the express train in 向ヶ丘遊園 station.</p>

<p>Next stop is 新百合ヶ丘.</p>

<p>Lin and I replanted the sakura tree which we planted (too close to the
wall) last week.  There was a slight gap in the rain so we took the
chance to move the tree.</p>

<p>I was thankful I had done a careful job of packing mud and nutritious
leaves for the tree last week.  I was able to dig those up and reuse
them today.  To be honest I was a bit frustrated by the end and just
wanted to get it done, and then Lin bumped her head quite hard on the
window frame that extends out from the house.  (it sounded like a
heavy rock falling onto the ground).  I wanted her to stop working and
go inside, but she wanted to clean up the final bits of mud.</p>

<p>Most interesting about the whole thing was when Azuma-san came by and
said we didn&rsquo;t need to move it; the tree would have been fine 20cm
from the wall.  He showed us the tree near his wall as evidence.
Hmmm.  It&rsquo;s a different kind of tree, but fair enough.</p>

<p>I know the nimble cats can jump <em>over</em> it, but hopefully the mean
heavy cats will not.  There&rsquo;s a small brown cat who likes to chill on
our balcony.  We&rsquo;re not ready for three (3) cats, so haven&rsquo;t let him
inside.  But we have been feeding him because&hellip; cat!</p>

<p>However, there&rsquo;s a big bully cat who wants the same balcony space so I
blocked the small gap where they usually enter the balcony.  Lin says
she has seen the little cat jump over the railing, and I hope my
little fence will disuade the big cat from coming in.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the staff of our local tool+building materials shop.  I
like shopping there because I like to imagine it&rsquo;s closer to nature
than going to a 100 yen shop with plastic crap everywhere.</p>

<p>Though, ironically, I bought metal fences at the 100 yen shop and
plastic ties from my preferred shop.</p>
