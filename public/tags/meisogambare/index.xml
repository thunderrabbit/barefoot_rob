By the first person who looked at it, 瞑想頑張れ was rejected for being too simple. I wrote in an appeal (which I forgot to save for posting here) that said &amp;ldquo;yeah but it has the one killer feature that all other meditation timers lack!&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s still available on github, but not nearly as easy to install that way.
Hopefully the appeal will appeal to the next person, or my planned updates will make the difference to get it approved.</description>

I submitted 瞑想頑張れ a few days ago. It&amp;rsquo;s not approved yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to add on some bits, right after I go through Beginning Storyboards tutorial.
hmmmmmm I just added the time above, and realize I would like a way to paste the current time + day + date like I did in my previous journal entries. With wordpress, I only have the date in the metadata, not in the entries themselves.</description>

Standing in the 2nd floor of the Shibuya Apple Store, with my phone charging on a display computer, I created an icon for 瞑想頑張れ and submitted the app to Apple for approval. Whoohoooo!
The icon looks something like this:

I know I dropped the れ, but I hope I used the right kanji!!!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the 姪御頑張れ commit I first submitted to Apple.</description>

I just added to my issues list an indication that I want to have a bit of color in 瞑想頑張れ. That will be easy squeezy. Gotta create some icons and default.png files, turn off the post to FB stuff, and then I can fuckitship.it.</description>

      <description>##23:11 Monday 11 March 2013
This weekend I mostly put together what I&amp;rsquo;m calling the 瞑想頑張れ meditation timer, which is a bit like referring to &amp;ldquo;ATM machines&amp;rdquo; but hey at least it&amp;rsquo;s two different languages.
It&amp;rsquo;s now available on github: 瞑想頑張れ at https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare.
There are several meditation timers on the app store, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t found one with the unique feature I wanted.
Sometimes when I meditate, I really get into it and don&amp;rsquo;t want to stop when the original time is up.</description>
