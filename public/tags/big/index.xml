      <description>07:37 Saturday 16 December 2017 -02 Last night was my (and Lin&amp;rsquo;s) first time to travel in an Airbus A380. Our flight was around 15 hours from Dubai to São Paulo on Emirates, which is apparently Airbus&amp;rsquo; largest A380 customer.
I was impressed with how relatively quiet the plane was during the entire flight. (I had a window seat just at the trailing edge of the wings.)
We had a hard landing with a bounce, but the aircraft came to a stop very quickly and smoothly.</description>
