                        <p class=date>1:30am Wednesday 28 april 1999</p>

<p><p>This week Jen is in town from New Hampshire!  This is part two of the climate exchange program, where I went to NH in February to experience something a tad cold, and she&rsquo;s here in Houston now to experience something a tad warm.  She&rsquo;s also going to apply for grad school at Rice.</p>

<p><p>We&rsquo;ve been happily busy.  On Monday I substituted for Aline on KTRU from 11am to 1pm, and Jen helped choose music and helped pronounce some of the jazz artists&rsquo; names.  She even added some cool facts about the artists and music that I would never have known!</p>

<p><p>Today we went to my dad&rsquo;s house north of Tomball, and said HI and hung out (I read Sunday comics) and went to brunch.  Then we cruised back to my dad&rsquo;s and Jen and I read from WIRED magazine the article &ldquo;83 reasons why Bill Gates can be beat&rdquo; or something.</p>

<p><p>Then back to my part of town and we watched <em>Never Been Kissed</em>.  Drew Barrymore is totally totally cute.</p>

<p><p>Jen is spending the night at Wende&rsquo;s tonight.  I&rsquo;ve been working on website stuff with Dude.</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow:
<ul>
<li>10am: go get Jen, eat breakfast
<li>11am: hour or so at Mad Potter and paint pottery and work on my plate.
<li>1pm: Take Jen to get shoulder massage at whole foods before her flute performance on Friday.
<li>4pm: Me and Jen go to Rice for an economics experiment thing
<li>7pm: Mad Potter with youth group.  They&rsquo;ll paint 4x4 inch tiles that we will place in a newly poured sidewalk on May 2nd at the Children&rsquo;s Museum! Should be super fun.
<li>9pm: Rob and Jen at Rice and I&rsquo;ll read some chapters of <a href="../../thepin/index.html">my novel</a> to a small informal audience.  This will not be broadcast live, but will be recorded and may be broadcast later.
<li>4am - 7am Thursday  Rob and Jen on KTRU!!
</ul></p>

<p class=date>1:30pm Monday 26 April 1999</p>

<p>Jen and I just finished at KTRU.  We had big fun!  She browsed the stacks and chose discs and I played them. Great variety and she helped pronounce some of the artists and gave background information on a lot of them.  Way cool.  I recorded on tape most of the times she was speaking.

<p>Planned: my dad's on Tuesday, Kathy Fey at Whole Foods on Wednesday, Beach on Thursday, Rice Concert Thursday, Drum Circle Friday nite, Astroworld on Saturday!!

<p class=date></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="arial">1:00am Thursday 29 April 1999</font>

<p>Dad's was cool. we talked then ate at The Nook in Tomball.  Drove out via 290, back via 249 to show Jen more roads.  Saw some backwards cement mixers, with the cab in front and engine in back and the pointy end of the barrel pointing forward.

<p>Back to my dad's house he had to go to work; Jen and I read "83 Reasons Why Bill Gates Can Be Beat" or something out of WIRED magazine.

<p>Drove back to my area and watched <em>Never Been Kissed</em> starring the infinitely cute Drew Barrymore.   I worked on website stuff and found a super incredible applet composer that allowed me to create a vertical scrolling applet in 30 minutes!  I downloaded the composer from <a href="https://www.opencube.com">www.opencube.com</a>.  Jen slept at Wende's.

<p>Today: up, got Jen, hi to Cassandra and Tere and Mad Potter, got Wende's credit card at her work, went to Whole Foods so Jen could get her shoulders massaged by Kathy Fey, went to KTRU at 4pm to meet Alex et. al. for an economics experiment. We bid on various pie charts' values, and actually made money! I got $14.75; Jen got $16.25!!  Super cool!

<p>Then to Cost Plus and returned Wende's stuff and I got a picture of Sydney Australia Opera House and bay.  Then to Mad Potter where youth painted tiles for Children's Museum on Sunday.

<p>Then to Rice U and I read 3.5 chapters of <a
href="/writings/thepin/index.shtml">The Past Is Now</a> (last half of
Air vs Atmosphere, Bigg Decision, Brain Removal, and Flash Furnace) at
950 watts, outdoors in the courtyard at Ley Center.  Jen said I did
great.  One guy (crowd of like 30) went "WHooo Hooo!!" after I
finished so I gave him my copy of the chapters.</p>

<p>Listened to other readers and then home.  It's 1:10am.  Must be up in 2.3 hours to DJ at KTRU!

<p class=date>7:30am Thursday 29 April 1999</p>

<p>KTRU with Jen was great.  She essentially chose all the music (all but 3 songs) and I played it.  She greatly expanded on certain artists with which she was familiar and made the show hella more interesting.  I really apreciated her help since we had to write down all the songs and artist twice, Plus the composer and time it was played for BMI, some music survey thing.
<br>At the end of the shift, Mark wasn't there so we played some long tracks and signed off after the first long one at 7:12 or so and had an 18 minute track cued up for Mark as he came in.  Thank you Jen for a great shift!!

<p class=date>1pm or so</p>

<p>We slept till 11:15 and are now at Stewart Beach in Galveston.  We checked out the nice warm water (nice and warm for Jen, barely warm for me) and I buried my toes in the sand while standing in stomach-deep water in an attempt to stay in a relatively fixed position despite the wave motion.

<p class=date>3pm</p>

<p>Eating at Bennos Cajun Style Seafood.  A dude offred us "best crawfish on the island!  Come on and try it" and another guy was munching some so we grabbed some off his platter covered in cayan pepper so thick it's now stuck in my cuticles. Crazy.  Weather is beautiful and sunny; we're eating outside.

<p>"So how'd you get to be The Crawfish King?" I asked the man.

<p>"I just started. I dunno.  I sell live crawfish to about 75% of the places on the island."

<p>"Wow.  hey <em>blah blah blah</em> want me to build you a website?"

<p>He smiled. "Naw, that's alright. I quit advertising about 2 years ago."  He burst into laughter.

<p>"Congratulations."

<p><hr width="20%" align="left">

<p>Back to eating and suddenly <em><b>bing:</b> it's time to go to the ferry.</em>  We had planned to ride the ferry, and now my angels said it was time to go.  We leisurely said bye after cleaning up and leisurely drove to the ferry.  Parked.  Walked on. <em><b>HONK</b></em> went the ferry and away we went across the bay.  Amazing perfect timing.  Thank you, angels.

<p>Walked around on that end; Jen went down a pier; I talked to some kids on a school bus waiting for the ferry.

<p class=date>7pm</p>

<p>Hopped back on a ferry once we were done chillin' and a super friendly guy saw Jen taking pictures of sea gulls being fed.  He was all, "here, stand in the back of my truck and feed them these Fritos."  He put down the tailgate and we got some great shots of Jen feeding sea gulls, and I think some of me too.

<p>Back to my place via Dairy Queen, each showered, took Jen to Rice for a concert and I'm at FlashNet meeting with Rhonda, my first possible distributor who I didn't previously know.

<p class=date>2:20am Friday 30 April 1999</p>

<p>She signed up!  We'll talk on Sunday afternoon after she gets back from the weekend.

<p>Talking to Jennifer (a different Jen) from Mad Potter now.

<p class=date>9:17am Friday 30 April 1999</p>

<p>Last night when Jennifer called, I was in the middle of pouring hot wax on Wende's feet as she was complaining about them being cold.  Jen was there and we had been playing and wrestling and doing our own silly fun talking and having a supre great time when Jennifer called at midnight.

<p>I totally broke the connection with Jen and only paid attention to Wende to peel the wax from her feet.  I was totally focused on <em>new girl</em>, a pattern I've seen too many times in my past.

<p>I am thankful that Wende called me on it this morning; I literally didn't notice last night what was happening and how I hurt Wen and Jen.

<p>After doing some self analysis, I find that I didn't want to ignore Jennifer's phone call because then she might not like me and I'd never see her again and then I'd be alone. (base level fear).   I meditated on it and set the intention to become aware if that happens again.

<p class=date>12:40am Saturday 1 May 1999</p>

<p>Today I took Jen to Rice and then worked on Meagyn's tile at Mad Potter.  Got Jen then did web stuff.  Did more when Wen and Jen went to Ikea. Then Jen and I went to NPI where the guy ruined some of the film in her camera by opening it.  Doh.  not all lost though - got lots of pics from Galveston yesterday.  Pics of Jen feeding birds on Ferry.  Then bookstop and then drum circle and wrestled with Wen and Jen on bed now we are at House of Pies. I am tired as shit.  Even "Tubthumping" couldn't even wake me up.

<p class=date>6pm Sunday 2 May 1999</p>

<p><p>Took Jen to the airport then went to youth group, then to Beck&rsquo;s Prime, then picked up tiles for the Children&rsquo;s Museum thing.</p>

<p><p>The youth had super big fun arranging the tiles in the cement, decorating the whole thing with little jeweled stone things, and the youth honored me by having my right footprint splat hugely in the middle of the square. Wow.</p>

<p><p>kT and I played in the museum with a ping pong ball blower tube thing that essentially used fans to blow ping pong balls through clear tubing to the other person&rsquo;s station.  We laughed and laughed at our respective stations for like 20 minutes, seeing who could shove the most ping pong balls toward the other person&rsquo;s thing.  So much fun.</p>
