      <description>1:30am Wednesday 28 april 1999
This week Jen is in town from New Hampshire! This is part two of the climate exchange program, where I went to NH in February to experience something a tad cold, and she&amp;rsquo;s here in Houston now to experience something a tad warm. She&amp;rsquo;s also going to apply for grad school at Rice.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been happily busy. On Monday I substituted for Aline on KTRU from 11am to 1pm, and Jen helped choose music and helped pronounce some of the jazz artists&amp;rsquo; names.</description>

      <description>(transcribed from my diary)
1:30pm Monday 26 April 1999
Jen and I just finished at KTRU. We had big fun! She browsed the stacks and chose discs and I played them. Great variety and she helped pronounce some of the artists and gave background information on a lot of them. Way cool. I recorded on tape most of the times she was speaking. Planned: my dad&#39;s on Tuesday, Kathy Fey at Whole Foods on Wednesday, Beach on Thursday, Rice Concert Thursday, Drum Circle Friday nite, Astroworld on Saturday!</description>
