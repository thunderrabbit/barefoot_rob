      <description>##22:27 Monday 26 November 2012
Yesterday, I wrapped Lin&amp;rsquo;s gift quite thoroughly. It&amp;rsquo;s got at least 5 layers, two of which are bound with twine made of twine or plastic fibers. I still need to put the outer layer of wrapping on it. I considered mailing it to Fred so he could mail it back, but that would more than double the price. It would be funny, but not worth it just to confuse Lin as to the gift&amp;rsquo;s origin.</description>
