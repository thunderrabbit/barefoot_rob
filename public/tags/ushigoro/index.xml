      <description>14:21 Monday 09 April 2018 JST Today was the last lesson for Ushigoro. We had finished up everything last week, having done their exams, so today we just did lots of Q and A sessions, first with the class split into two groups, and then with all students asking questions of one student.
I offered my LINE QR code in case they want to ask questions or continue practicing their English.</description>
