<p>Thanks to Drian for helping me clean up some of the transitions and
tying up some loose ends on my Pecha Kucha presentation.  He helped
connect the thread of marriage back to the main theme, and helped
tighten up the ending so it would be more impactful.</p>

<p>Hmmm.  Last night the idea of presenting at Pecha Kucha came to mind.
Could be a good place to speak about authenticity</p>

<p>Some fragments came to mind while walking to the station</p>

<ul>
<li>I like walking barefoot   (on beach)</li>
<li>Not just on the beach but everwhere I can (collage of barefeet walking)</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about what people think</li>
<li>Just be happy</li>
<li>Not always happy</li>
<li>Sometimes life can be surprising   (surprise snake)</li>
<li>What if we could talk about it?</li>
<li>Not to a mirror, but to a person who listens</li>
<li>What if we take time to sit and just be  (black screen)</li>
<li>Sometimes we might find monsters</li>
<li>but it turns out they&rsquo;re just unheard sadness</li>
<li>I broke my shoulder             (x-ray picture)</li>
<li>Had just meditated so wasn&rsquo;t bothered</li>
<li>I lost my rabbit       (Francois picture)</li>
<li>found him all cleaned up and repaired on Ebay!</li>
<li>Life&rsquo;s little mysteries   (factory production line thousand copies Francois)</li>
<li>Sometimes people fight like this (not listening picture)</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m afraid.  scared to come up here.</li>
<li>Can I tell you that?  Can I be honest with you?</li>
<li>Will you still like me?   Still listen to me?</li>
<li>My pessimistic side says you won&rsquo;t.  I&rsquo;ll be booed off stage and I&rsquo;m doing it wrong and no one will understand and it will just be terrrible</li>
<li>But I can&rsquo;t control other people&rsquo;s responses.  More important question:</li>
<li>Will I still like myself?</li>
<li>You know when you walk barefoot outside in the city and you step on a piece of glass and you have to ask your wife to dig in there with a needle to pull it out, and you&rsquo;re just lying there feeling helpless with a needle near a sensitive part of your body? I mean the feet!</li>
<li>Probably not.  That&rsquo;s why I encourage people to use &ldquo;I-statements.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sometimes, when I walk outside in Tokyo, I step on a piece of glass and can feel it lodged in my foot.  I limp for the rest of the day and then ask my wife to dig in there with a needle to pull it out.<br /></li>
<li>But I don&rsquo;t feel helpless, because I trust her.</li>
<li>Can I trust her with my soul?  Sure; it&rsquo;s eternal. What about my feelings and emotions?  Uh oh!  Scary!</li>
</ul>
