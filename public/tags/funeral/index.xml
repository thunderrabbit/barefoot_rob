(transcribed from my diary)
Pete just farted, and describes the flavor as awesome. The ride up with Fred was fun - oh we&#39;re in Slidell, Louisiana for our aunt Jean&#39;s funeral. We&#39;re puttin&#39; the fun back in funeral. We&#39;re talking roller coaster stories now. It&#39;s good to catch up with Pete every once in a while. [ed. note: please understand that we all love Jean so very much and would never wish her harm or ill will of any sort.</description>
