      <description>Ask HN: What is your money-making side project outside programming?
My reply, copied below:
TL;DR: not making money yet, but enjoying stop motion animation of marble track construction.
Back in the day, my brother and I would use Legos to build tracks for marbles, using roof pieces as ramps. Eventually I started making marble tracks out of popsicle sticks. Over a period of some years, I built a track 2+ feet (70cm) tall with lots of tracks intertwining each other all the way down.</description>
