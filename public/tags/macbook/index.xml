      <description>10:34 Sunday 14 April 2019 JST I am on the way back from Loreatec with another new battery in my computer. I replaced it back in December or so, but it never really acted right. Hopefully this one will do the right things.
Lantz offered this battery at no cost after I tried to pay him. We settled on half price.
10:40 Sunday 14 April 2019 JST Battery has gone from 36 to 31 percent in a few minutes.</description>

      <description>22:22 Saturday 17 November 2018 JST Yuck. One of the fans on my Macbook is clattering as it spins.
I do not know how to estimate decibels, but it is annoying. It sounds about like an old hard drive.</description>
