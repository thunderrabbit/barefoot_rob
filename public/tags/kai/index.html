<p>昨日ピンクカウ美佳さんと佳依さんと会って楽しみました。　Had a good time
chilling with Kai and Mika at The Pink Cow last night.</p>

<p>マイケルさんも会った。彼が世界の1番よくなバーテンダーでしたって。We
also met Michael. He said he&rsquo;s the worlds best bartender.</p>

<p>そうでもそうでもないわからないけど、彼と面白い話できた。I don&rsquo;t know
if that&rsquo;s true, but we had a good time talking to him.</p>

<p>美佳さんと佳依さんと日本語でも英語でも喋りました。I spoke in Japanese
and English with Kai and Mika.</p>

<p>戸からピンポン音はピッザヂリベリかたが来た。みんながびっくりした。笑
Everyone was surprised when we heard a knock at the door; it was a
pizza delivery guy. haha</p>

<p>佳依さんと同じ電車で帰りましたけど彼女が先に降りました。Kai and I took the same train home, but she got off first.</p>

<p>Went to SOGO for workout with about 50 people in attendance.  Great
weather and great workout.  I met Shell, Koji, Tyler, and others, but
cannot remember now.</p>

<p>Went to lunch with Lisa at Laska and chatted with her a bit, and got
to see a video of the type of dancing she is doing.</p>

<p>Went down to Tsujido for karaoke after recording video at karaoke with
Kai, Mitsue, and Soness as the stars.  Got to see long-time-no-see
Yuji, and longer-time-no-see Jesse.  Plus got to meet all-time-no-see
Vesna.  Thanks to Soness for organizing and inviting, and giving me
some crazy sock-shoes!</p>

<p>Came back for lesson with Sarumama but got her cancellation request on
my way home.  She said she will pay for the lesson.</p>

<p>Walking toward home, I saw the guy next to the telescope stand I
sometimes see with or without a telescope.  This time he had his
telescope connected to a laptop which could see the image.  Much
easier to use than back in the day when we had to squat down and
squint up into the eyepiece.  He showed me a picture he had taken of a
nebula, which was apparently 120 snapshots overlaid on each other to
get sufficient brightness.  It looked quite good for such a small
telescope!  (3 inches or so)</p>

<p>Hung out with Kai and Mika near Mika&rsquo;s work tonight.  They gave me a
stack of flyers to hand out for a show that Mika and Kai will be
staffing on Monday.  Thanks to Mika for sending my medium rare burger
back to be recooked to well done as I had ordered!  Thanks to Mama for
snacks she brought back today from her trip.</p>

<p>Mika had to head back to work so Kai and I walked her there and then
walked to Tokyo station by way of her English speaking dentist.  We
met a man in the station who is apparently an 江戸子(sp), and talked
about how his ggggrandfather was a samurai.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2017/funny_guy.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2017/thumbs/funny_guy.jpg" alt="funny guy" /></a></p>

<p>Kai and I took the second oldest subway in Tokyo to the busiest train
station in Japan (the world?) and I jumped into a picture with some
guys who were posing next to a sign featuring Snoopy and large text
&ldquo;Pose here&rdquo; or something.  Then the timing worked out that Lin arrived
just after me so we took the same train back to our station!</p>

<p>Met Kai today at 1pm to edit her presentation which she translated
from Japanese.  It was pretty decent actually, with just a few wonky
sentence structures and some punctuation typos.  It was so easy that
it did not take the 2 hours we had allocated, but boom done in an hour
sitting at (&ldquo;Fresh like a box of _______ ______&ldquo;) down near Azalea.</p>

<h2 id="16-18-monday-24-july-2017-jst">16:18 Monday 24 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>So tired, can barely stay awake enough to make sure I don&rsquo;t zonk out
and miss the lesson which starts 1t 5:30pm.  I actually considered
getting a massage for an hour because then I could sleep and they
would wake me up after the hour, but that would cost more cash than I
have on me.</p>

<p>I missed SOGO 4 weeks in a row, and will miss it again next week, but
I enjoyed being back today!  Saw Kai while walking near Harajuku
station so got to say HI to her for a bit.  Super glad that she has
been enjoying the workout as well.  She met Tai while there, so they
enjoyed having rhyming names.</p>

<p>I have not yet seen Kai&rsquo;s great presentation, but I have been assured
it was great!  Soness coached her, so I know she received
compassionate knowledgable wisdom from a speaking pro!</p>

<p>I arrived just as the last speaker finished; I found the room because
I heard the applause from outside the door.</p>

<p>Lukas invited me in for the final picture, so we stood together in the
back.  He actually knew me from having been on TV earlier this year!</p>

<p>I also met his friend Rikako, who asked me about being barefoot, and
we thereby me Kiyoka and Daniel, who said they were eavesdropping on
our conversation.  I told them the whole story about being barefoot in
Houston and then being shod here before realizing no one would mind if
I were to be barefoot here.  I talked about my Pecha Kucha
presentation from last year (and got confused on the dates, thinking
my TV appearance was this February, but it was actually <em>last</em>
February (or so).  Anyway, they seemed interested so I told them about
and invited them to men&rsquo;s circle and co-gender circle respectively.</p>

<p>Rikako and Lukas are hosting a gathering this Saturday (near me and
Lin&rsquo;s house!) so I will join them there.</p>

<p>I gave a testimonial for Soness&rsquo;s coaching; I can still remember the
experience of preparing and presenting for Pecha Kucha as if it were a
recent event.  Kai did a testimonial as well; we could see she was
carrying herself with more confidence than before.  Apparently her
co-workers have recognized this as well.  So proud of her!</p>

yet, but I plan to.  After I get these servers updated.</p>

<p>On the train now after hanging out with Mika and Kai for nearly 3
hours around Tokyo station.  French restaurant Gabo and then Mary&rsquo;s
(chocolate) Cafe where customers can self-serve white chocolate
shavings on drinks!</p>

<p>Mika is moving to a new company, so this was our bye-bye party for
her.  We talked about their kanji, which I forgot, and Lin&rsquo;s kanji,
which I remember.  Kai showed pictures of their trip to Europe and we
compared our experiences in Paris; Kai saw Versaille, which sounds
really big and beautiful!</p>

<p>In the cafe, conversation was less tangible; what do you believe
happens after we die? what do you want to be next lifetime? and I
mentioned David&rsquo;s statement &ldquo;the spirit world is real,&rdquo; which he told
us after doing a retreat (featuring ayahuasca) in Peru.</p>
