      <description>10:46 Monday 09 October 2017 JST As soon as I thought to write &amp;ldquo;flying home,&amp;rdquo; I got a little pang of guilt. Isn&amp;rsquo;t my home Houston?
Anyway, the flight from Perth to Honkers was a bit long, but fine. I slept for most of the first six hours and then watched the movie CHiPs because it was listed as a comedy, but .. it was pretty dark if it was a comedy.</description>
