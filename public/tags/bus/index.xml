I&amp;rsquo;m on a bus! I&amp;rsquo;m on a bus! Everyone, look at me; I&amp;rsquo;m on a nearly empty bus, headed to Narita, headed to Seattle to see Colleenie Bean Dawg for a day doing touristy things in the city and then having pizza at their crib.
(The bus is now waiting at a light like 5 minutes from my house. So funny how transit works on this planet.</description>

      <description>13:43 Tuesday 28 November 2017 JST Recently,
 An elderly man fell as he was getting off the bus with an elderly woman. Everyone on the bus exclaimed, but the bus driver took off before anyone moved. I nearly completed the M Splitter on Marble Track 3. I tried getting Netlify CMS working, but still have a few bits missing, starting with authentication. I failed an test at TY. There will be other chances, but I felt sad because I had thought I would do better.</description>

      <description>14:07 Wednesday 15 November 2017 JST Not by much, but a couple of minutes. Not enough to make me late or anything, but I wonder if 23 consistently leaves first.</description>

In 45 minutes, Lin and I are heading to Shinjuku to bus to Fuji to chill and then visit Fuji-Q Highland tomorrow! Wooooo
##13:15
As our bus was pulling out of the boarding area, Lin and I were like &amp;ldquo;wowwww&amp;rdquo; because it&amp;rsquo;s in a pretty busy shopping district. Seemed to be less than a meter to spare in front of the bus on the first left turn.</description>
