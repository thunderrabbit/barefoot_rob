      <description>Recently, I have had a big server upgrade that has been challenging me on how to finish it. Yesterday I asked a friend of mine if he could look over my plan for the upgrade.
He agreed, and I began to write the email that articulated my plan.
Just in writing out the email I recalled the value of rubber ducking.
The idea is that you explain the problem to a rubber duck, giving enough information so that the rubber duck can understand.</description>
