      <description>01:43 Saturday 07 October 2017 JST 00:43 Saturday 07 October 2017 Perth Super thanks to E for picking me up from the airport and hosting me in his house. I&amp;rsquo;ve got twin beds in my own room. Very cozy!
We ate yogurt, apples, cinammon. I had chia seeds and nuts as well.
Hot tea and now a hot shower for me and bed because we are going to leave in 6.</description>

      <description>01:02 Wednesday 26 August 2015 JST I changed my life in 1997 by attending a weekend men&amp;rsquo;s retreat organized by https://mkp.org/ My ability to understand myself and my emotions / motivations grew exponentially from there. I&amp;rsquo;m by no means an expert, but I&amp;rsquo;m much better able to listen to others, and express myself&amp;hellip;. though not in this post, apparently!!
Anyway, I have missed the energy of this organization since moving to Japan, and recently decided to get involved again.</description>
