I started a scrap book just now. Oh, wait, my day: I had 2 bowls of rice krispies and part of an apple for breakfast. For lunch I had a hamburger, a slice of pizza, and tea. For my snack I had the rest of my apple and some Graham crackers, milk, and some pepsi, and 3 slices of bread. School: English - we went to the library again.</description>
