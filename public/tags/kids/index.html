<p>Been a pretty good day today despite the 6-year-old driving me a bit
crazy.  He seems to be a bit entitled and petulant, but maybe that is
my projection.  We played with the vertical labyrinth game, kids
blocks marble track, jenga, and tried to play pictionary, but his
version of the game was to write the words instead of draw them.  Make
sense!</p>

<p>Niece, nephews, and I watched <em>17 Again</em> which was better than I might
have expected.</p>

<p>Walked to the convenience store with nephews to get ice cream.  They
did well navigating back through the twists and turns.</p>

<p>Easy lessons today because Patrick was out.  After combining the 4:30
classes, we played a game with target language &ldquo;May I have a card,
please?,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ＿＿＿＿-ing,&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ＿＿＿＿-ing,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey ＿＿＿＿,
let&rsquo;s go ＿＿＿-ing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sorry I can&rsquo;t.  I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Matt is also out today, so I&rsquo;ll teach his 6pm lesson.</p>

<p>The kids lessons were pretty good today.  The two new students (one in
each of my first two classes) are still not speaking, and I can&rsquo;t tell
if they are acting shy or don&rsquo;t understand..  anytime they speak, they
get the right answer, but getting them to speak is a stretch.  esp
with the other kids being so chatty.  I ain&rsquo;t sure how to handle it.</p>

<p>So great to have only 9 students in the second class today, especially
after the first class was 20 kids of chaos.  The 9 kids were so good
that we had tons of time to do stuff!!  No time wasted wondering why
who was wailing with whom.</p>

<p>We had some older kids in the kids class today. I&rsquo;m not sure why they
were there, but they supported and some were enthusiastic / unafraid
to do the dance/song/etc that I presented.</p>

<p>The second class got cut short for some reason; basically a woman came
up and was like, &ldquo;okay, please tell them thank you (and goodbye)&rdquo; so I
confirmed it with the normal staff and yep, so finished up.</p>

<p>(written 07:14 Thursday 27 November 2014 JST)</p>

<p>The first kids class yesterday included the song &ldquo;Walking Walking&rdquo;
about 20 times; I brought Johnny (the bear I bought in Thailand) and
had him join in the circle as we sang Walking Walking.  All the kids
wanted a chance to hold his hand, thought at first I tried to skip a
few kids to save time.  Not that I normally try to save time when it
comes to play, but I felt a sense that I was suppose to do something
productive during the class.  Some of the kids cried so we did a
little sit down circle and each one got to sing the song while moving
Johnny to the next kid.</p>

<p>During the second class one girl cried and went to the side of the
room while we played Hokey Pokey.  I had the entire class slowly move
from the other end of hte room to the side where she was sitting.  I
sat down beside her and she was still moe joe, but realized I was
there for <em>her</em> when I took her hand to help her stand up.  She was
all genki by the end and seemed happy.</p>

<p>A lot of the kids were all climbing on me, trying to high five me and
hang on my arms.  That part is fun and great, but trying to do a
lesson during the chaos is chaos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you say chaos?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thanks to Soness helping me prepare, I was well enough prepared for
the kids lesson even though I felt crazy afraid before the lesson. I
believed I wasn&rsquo;t prepared; I had forgotten to bring Johnny (the
stuffed bear) who I planned to use as a teaching assistant; I didn&rsquo;t
have a way to play music in the class, and I was just a frazzled nut
before the lesson.</p>

<p>I texted Soness, and she called me back immediately for support. She
got me sorted: &ldquo;well, does the school have any stuffed animals you can
use?&rdquo; (they did) &ldquo;do they have any flashcards?&rdquo; (oh yeah I had
forgotten), and just general confidence that I&rsquo;d be fine.</p>

<hr />

<p>The lessons were a bit chaotic, but everyone survived (including me)
and only a few people cried (not including me).  The second class had
23 students, so we counted to 25 in the circle (includind me and their
full time teacher), and since they did so well, I had us count up
to 50.</p>

<p>I feel a lot more confident that I can present something fun and
enjoyable for the kindergarten classes on Wednesday!  Thanks to Soness
for sharing from her years of experience!</p>

<p>She agrees that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DreamEnglishKids">Dream English Kis</a> is
a great resource, and said Matt is a great person for me to model
because he&rsquo;s got good gestures and (like me,) isn&rsquo;t over-the-top
exuberant (like Soness).</p>

<p>I will help Soness with some online stuff, and in the process
hopefully learn how I can promote my own online stuff!  Ah!  I guess I
should have a mazes section on this website!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m prepping for the kids lesson today, and just had a good cry
regarding fear of standing and <em>performing</em> in front of groups!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m planning to use this
<a href="https://www.dreamenglish.com/goodbye">Goodbye song</a> each day, and as
I&rsquo;m here in front of my computer trying to learn it, I just felt this
surge of fear like OH FUCK! and just cried for a bit.</p>

<p><del>Fuck this;</del> I can<del>&rsquo;t</del> do it.</p>

<p>##11:10 Wednesday 12 November 2014 JST##</p>

<pre><code>HI Matt

I've been teaching English to adults (1-to-1) for several years in Tokyo.

Just recently I was asked to teach some kids classes.  :-O
20+ kids!  age 5 or so!!   Such a new insane experience!

Thank you for your resources; I linked to the Goodbye song from my
journal, though my brain went blank when I tried to sing it today
:-C

I will dig through your site more before I start buggin' you with
questions, but for now just want to say thank you.

    best
    - Rob

<p>And by &ldquo;best&rdquo; I mean, &ldquo;well, I survived&rdquo; though I&rsquo;m mentally drained
and have no idea how I can do it next week. I read the book &ldquo;Go, Dog,
Go&rdquo; which they seemed to enjoy, but I didn&rsquo;t see any other English
books at the school.</p>

<p>I have no good way to start the lesson.  I&rsquo;ve just done a crappy Hello
call and repeat thing but it&rsquo;s kind of shite.</p>

<p>After the crappy opening, I&rsquo;ve been doing &ldquo;Walking Walking&rdquo; which they
definitely enjoy.</p>

<p>As I near the end of each song or section, I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;oh crap I have no
idea what to do next!&rdquo; And today there were parents watching!  Eeeeeek!</p>

<p>The closing song, through crappy, has at least been consistent.  The
song I linked in previous entry is better and I hope I can remember it
next time.</p>
