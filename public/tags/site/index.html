                        <p>Hello</p>

<p>I have a rather large Hugo site which I have pared down into one bite sized repository.</p>

<p>I made some tweaks to the top page to only show Page type Blog (in content and in pagination)</p>

<p>There are also page type. journal which I would like to be displayed under /journal</p>

<p>This all worked a few versions of Hugo ago.</p>

<p>I upgraded Hugo to 0.58 recently and it stopped working.</p>

<p>Neither /blog nor /journal nor the top page show any content.</p>

<p>I think it just be related to ______
which says we have to use A instead of B.  I tried that but still no content was displayed.</p>

<p>Slept a lot because sick, but I spent some time on getting my site
theme figured out.</p>

<p><a href="https://5d0f8601c419c700089949de--zealous-varahamihira-b6564c.netlify.com/">https://5d0f8601c419c700089949de--zealous-varahamihira-b6564c.netlify.com/</a></p>

<p>I thought I had removed Professional and Creative from the homepage,
but seems they only got removed from the navigation.</p>

<p>Dang marbletrack3.com is broken now.  Netlify created the SSL cert and
neither of my browsers like it.</p>

<p>I will switch back to hosting on Dreamhost if Netlify cannot sort it
out.</p>

<p>I have created a support ticket with Netlify.</p>

<p>And to think I was about ready to shift all my static sites over.</p>

<p>I chatted with Joel today after doing a livestream on Facebook about
work-life-balance.  He tweaked the theme for Marble Track 3 to fix the
jumbotron at the top!  Super awesome.  Going to try it out now.</p>

<p>I broke my upload process, but I think it is fixed now.</p>

<p>Yep.  It took 65 seconds to process and upload to my server, but it
works.</p>

<p>When trying to get that number down, to a few seconds, I
mis-remembered how it was set up and destroyed the <code>public/</code> directory
of my Hugo-controlled site thinking Hugo can rebuild it, but since the
Hugo directory is already a Git repo, it was conflating the two, and
things got really confuzzed.  Including my brain.</p>

<p>I am considering removing dates from the content itself and just keep
them in the frontmatter.</p>

<p>What if I make them small like this:</p>

<h5 id="16-19-friday-14-september-2018-jst">16:19 Friday 14 September 2018 JST</h5>

<p>I<del> guess i</del>t will be an h5 tag, cause I put five # marks in front.</p>

<pre><code>HI Jackie!

I would like to make a site for my ongoing project, Marble Track 3.

I need some help kinda imagining how is best to present the
info+content I have, plus I have a few ideas+constraints of how I
think it should go.

I think the site can be implemented as a static website with no
backend coding required.  (Except *possibly* for a section
inviting people to get involved with the project.)

I need help with design and CSS.

For my current site at https://new.robnugen.com/ I am using Hugo
(https://gohugo.io/) to create the site based on a theme and a
bunch of markdown files for content.

For the new site, I would like to use my existing markdown files
for the BLOG portion of the site.

Here is an example BLOG source file
https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/robnugen-journal-entries/raw/master/2018/05/02mt3-retested-large-marble.md

From this, Hugo creates
https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/05/02/mt3-retested-large-marble/

I want to keep using the same markdown + YAML format so I do not
have to disrupt my current workflow too much.

Let me know if your eyes have not glazed over and I can tell you
more of what I am thinking.

(reminder to self: BLOG, ABOUT, SUPPORT, SNIPPETS, COMMUNITY )

love and light
- Rob

<pre><code>Hey Nathan

I am making a marble track, a.k.a. rolling ball track, similar to this
one I made several years ago, visible here https://mt2.robnugen.com/

This time, however, I am not just making the track, I am also making a
stop action animation of some characters making the track.  Clips of
the video so far are here https://mt3s.robnugen.com in a playlist.
(No audio nor background yet; that is a whole other project (I asked
you about Blender before))

The project is about 5% finished, and has taken a year to get this
far.  I don't have many followers yet, but I would like to have a
domain dedicated to the site while I build and document the whole
thing.

So basically, I want to make a site for the content visible here
https://mt3.robnugen.com/, but with branding specific to Marble Track
3, not Thunder Rabbit.

I think I &quot;just&quot; need a Hugo theme; I am using Hugo (static site
generator) to make the current site, including blog, photos, and
embedded Youtube videos.  I write pages in markdown format, using YAML
format for the frontmatter(1) (meta data: title, date, tags)

From this example source file
https://bitbucket.org/thunderrabbit/robnugen-journal-entries/raw/master/2018/05/02mt3-retested-large-marble.md

Hugo creates
https://new.robnugen.com/journal/2018/05/02/mt3-retested-large-marble/

I want to keep using that markdown + YAML format so I do not have to
disrupt my current workflow too much.

Here is my current theme https://github.com/thunderrabbit/purehugo-tr

How do we go about pricing such a thing?  I would be happy to include
a link to your site as designer.

   See you soon!
   - Rob

<p>It seems like there was something wrong with my rsync command, but I
didn&rsquo;t change anything.</p>

<p>I blew away my directory online and rsynced again and it seems to work

<p>Huh.  I have a ton of files from my journal with messed up dates
/1/01/01</p>
