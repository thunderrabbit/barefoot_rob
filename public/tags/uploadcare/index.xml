      <description>18:56 Saturday 19 August 2017 JST I am using my phone to give my PC access to the web, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t working, so I&amp;rsquo;ll save this email here.
Hi Alex This URL describes the directory structure that I would like to backup. https://helpwiki.evergreen.edu/wiki/index.php/Folder_Structure_-_Dragonframe I am currently using rsync over ssh to save it to my server, but I am open to having it backed up to mutlple places. I guess uploadcare uses its own filenames for each file that is uploaded.</description>
