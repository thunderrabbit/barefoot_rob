      <description>17:18 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 (SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil) 23:19 Sunday 31 December 2017 +04 (Dubai - United Arab Emirates) 04:20 Monday 01 January 2018 JST (Tokyo - Japan) We arrived and went to the baggage claim but, fortunately thanks to Lin checking first, we discovered we could not get our checked baggage in Dubai when staying in hotels in the airport.
But what&amp;rsquo;s awesome: the guy was like beep beep beep and said our baggage would be redirected to Haneda just like that boom.</description>

      <description>21:57 Thursday 05 October 2017 JST I&amp;rsquo;m in a hotel near Narita airport because my flight for Perth leaves at 9am tomorrow. I wish the shuttle left a bit earlier, but I guess it will be okay to arrive by 7am. 6:45 prolly.</description>

      <description>15:27 Friday 18 August 2017 JST I am not sure of the hotel name (yet?) but there is some kinda glass bead making thing downstairs starting at 4pm so I am tooootally going to be down there for that. Hopefully there will not be a long line. (There are only 4 desks so I kinda guess I will have to wait.)
They offer free hard apple cider from 3pm to 5pm.</description>

      <description>05:56 Wednesday 12 October 2016 JST Awake now; headed down to breaky.
06:44 Wednesday 12 October 2016 JST Breakfast was lots of veggies for me and a larger variety for Lin. The restaurant had a Pepper robot in front, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t follow me when I beckoned it. It faced me, but didn&amp;rsquo;t come with me.
Gotta pack and bounce outta here.
07:53 Wednesday 12 October 2016 JST I&amp;rsquo;m the first person in the departure lounge!</description>
