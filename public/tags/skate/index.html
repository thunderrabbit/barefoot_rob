                        <p><title>SKATE!!</title>
<p class=date>11:07pm Thursday 13 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Started as we normally do on Thursday nights, meeting at Texas Art
Supply (very close to my house)  This night, only Scott and I showed
up.  I was quite excited to skate, and a bit glad that it was only he
and I; I haven&rsquo;t been out in so long that I didn&rsquo;t want to hold back a
big group.</p>

<p><p>We set out toward downtown, and within 2 blocks, my legs were
burning.  <em>oh no</em> I thought, <em>this is going to be a short
night.</em>  I was really sucking wind by the time we crested the hill
on Taft as it approaches Allen Parkway.  I certainly didn&rsquo;t barrel down
it this night, but just enjoyed the gravitational assist going down the
hill.</p>

<p><p>By the time we got to downtown (two miles), however, my normal
endurance was nearly back.  I&rsquo;m not sure how that happened, but I
certainly appreciated my legs not screaming anymore.</p>

<p><p>We skated down some trails along Buffalo Bayou that I had never
previously skated.  They were nice and smooth, and okay for hills.
(When I first started skating 6 years ago they would have been Great
hills, but now they&rsquo;re just okay.)</p>

<p><p>To Brewery Tap, where we popped in for a second but found no skaters,
and continued our trek toward UH Downtown.  The hill up Main Street got
me pretty well winded again; I had to sit down or I would have fainted
at the top.  (I thought <em>wouldn&rsquo;t it suck if I was leaning over the
wall and fainted and fell off&hellip;</em>.. So I sat down)</p>

<p><p>Upon my recovery, we skated down the other side of the hill and
underneath the school, into the lower level parking garage, up an
elevator to inside the building and got some water from the fountain.</p>

<p><p>The halls were deserted (winter break), and lovely smoooooth
marble/granite tile stuff.  Very nice.  Skated outside and found
ourselves back at the top of the hill where I had previously not toppled
over the wall to my demise.</p>

<p><p>Instead, we skated down it really fast.  I taught Scott how I time
the light for it to be green once I reach the bottom, and we proceeded
once the time was right.  Zzzzoooommmmm!!!!   lovely zzzzz zzzzzz zzzzzz
sound as each skate pushed on the grooved pavement.  Light turned green
and I sailed through the intersection at the bottom.  Still not enough
speed for me.  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Over to George R Brown Convention Center, and <em>big</em> unexpected
tents filled the parking lot!!  The Circus??   Yes!  Ringling Brothers
and Barnum and Bailey Circus in tents that I decided were smaller than I
might have expected..  We tried to get in (not very enthusiastically) at
all three entrances, but were politely declined entry.  Ended up talking
to a professional skater guy who skates in the circus.  That&rsquo;s pretty
cool.</p>

<p><p>Back toward home, we found ourselves down by Buffalo Bayou again, but
on the other side.  We came to a barrier in the sidewalk.  On the right
was the bayou, and on the left was a 45 degree rough concrete incline
which I scaled on all fours about 40 feet up to the top.  Scott did the
same, but on the grass along the side.  Then on my third attempt, I was
able to jump/climb/scramble up and over a 5 foot vertical wall.  Scott
took his skates off to climb over.</p>

<p><p>Toward home and where I wanted to turn right, Scott wnted to go
straight through 4th Ward.  We&rsquo;ve skated through it before with no
problems, but I&rsquo;m always a tad nervous.  This night, after Scott had to
kinda bail off the street to keep from getting squished by a car, I
skated past a kid about 16 years old, who underhand-tossed a little
tightly wound piece of paper or a cigarette butt up at me and said,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s up officer?&rdquo; as I whizzed by.  It hit me above the eye, but I
just ignored him and brushed my forehead like removing a drop of sweat.
Nothing else significant happened.</p>

<p><p>Puhed the last couple of blocks to Texas Art Supply, where I streched
while Scott took off his skates.</p>

<p><p>Oh!! That totally reminds me.  I told him about Fred and unicycle and
stuff and Scott had the best idea for learning how to ride!  A shopping
cart!!  It&rsquo;s the correct height; it rolls; it&rsquo;s sturdy.. perfect!  Scott
has a unicyle that I may borrow from him on Tuesday.</p>

<p><p>Yay!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>Yay!</p>

<p><p>Today was payday at my work.  $823 for me for two weeks&rsquo; work. Today I scoured the internet for a bulk email management program, but found only 2 possibilities for us.</p>

<p><p>We need one that will allow us to send a unique attachment to 30000 email addresses, keep track of bounces, easily resend to a few addresses, and that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p><p>I found tons and tons of software to help spammers scour the Internet for email addresses, and how to send email &ldquo;without your ISP knowing you&rsquo;re sending bulk email!&rdquo; and &ldquo;free 50,000 fresh email addresses with your order!&rdquo; and stuff like that. No wonder spam is so prolific!</p>

<p><p>Did a little bit of javascript stuff, making some windows refresh as a different window is clicked.  I did that for Dude for some project he&rsquo;s doing at his work.</p>

<p><p>My friend Jennie sent me a super <b>sick</b>ening photo of a crocodile with his gut cut open and&hellip; nevermind. It&rsquo;s gross. Don&rsquo;t click here<a href="https://www.artbell.com/images/amercroc.jpg">!</a></p>

<p><p>After work I filled out a form for my insurance company so they will pay for my stitches from back in JUNE! Ack.  I am anti-impressed with them.</p>

<p><p>Yay!  Going to skate now!  It&rsquo;s 7:45pm</p>

<p>I went skating last night but didn&rsquo;t really have the energy to do
much.  I fell once while jumping over a road hump thing.  The fall was
not bad, but was an indication that something was amiss in my skating
abilities.  I had never previously fallen while jumping a road hump!
(There are times when I don&rsquo;t make it all the way over the hump, but
that doesn&rsquo;t cause a fall.</p>

<p>On the way to downtown I kinda tripped once, jumping sideways off the
sidewalk into the street.</p>

<p>Once we got to Louisiana Street, I zipped down with traffic down past
Jones Plaza where Party On the Plaza was being held.  No problem doing
it this time, but I didn&rsquo;t have huge big crazy energy that I usually
do.</p>

<p>I rested at the plaza and then did the street thing once more.</p>

<p>This time I almost fell and it would have been really bad.  My right
skate hit a small pothole in the street (small like 3 inches across)
and I almost fell on my face.  I recovered quickly though and hopped
up onto the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Apparently it was time to go home.</p>

<p>On the way out, I saw Ryan!  He&rsquo;s one of my youth at Emerson, except
for the fact that I&rsquo;m not currently a youth advisor there.  Met his
parents and sister.</p>

<p>Near City Hall, I saw some guys painting in the street. They were
measuring and marking 10 foot square blocks for some kind of booths
for a street fest type deal.  That was pretty neat.  A couple times he
lost track of what number he was s&rsquo;posed to paint in the block, so I
reminded him, but he didn&rsquo;t thank me.</p>

<p>Got home, and I boiled some water for chicken soup tonight and forgot
about it and it all boiled away.  No harm done, fortunately.  It was
just water and I didn&rsquo;t cook the dry pot for too long.  Whew!</p>

<p>Sleep sleep sleep.</p>

                        <p class=date>20 August 1999</p>

<p><p>Last night was Thursday, so I went skating. No one else was in our designated parking lot at 8pm, so I sat in Scott&rsquo;s open trunk writing in my diary for a few moments. I was literally ready to leave at 8:09 when two people arrived at the same moment.</p>

<p><p>We got our skates on and we headed toward downtown.  I love skating through downtown.  The construction, the traffic, the unlimited space, steps, curbs; all the things that are unlike a skating rink, I love.</p>

<p><p>One big thing we were unlikely to find in a skating rink is the new baseball stadium.  It spans 4 city blocks and resembles an enormous Erector Set construction (I&rsquo;m showing my age) with bold uncovered metal girders and beams.  The most amazing thing about it: the roof is like a sunroof!  The whole huge thing is on wheels and can be retracted!  I guess it&rsquo;s more like a convertable because the entire top half of the stadium can roll to one side.  Unlike a convertable, it doesn&rsquo;t fold up and hide underneath a fabric or leather cover, but it&rsquo;s still super impressive.  When I exclaimed, &ldquo;holy shit are those wheels???&rdquo;  Kim and David were like, &ldquo;yeah; where have you been?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Toward George R. Brown Convention Center we skated, and oh-my-gosh those are grandstands - giant sets of bleachers have been set up for the race car thing.  Is it Stock Car? Nascar? Obviously I don&rsquo;t pay much attention to it, but I certainly enjoyed skating along the super smooth asphalt in front of thousands of cheering ghost spectators.</p>

<p><p>Then to some biker bar with hundreds of sparkling hogs and cycles out front and hundreds of boistrous bearded tattooed bikers inside.  Just like in the movies, except right in my downtown!  We spent several minutes ogling the bikes; Kim and David had much more apparent knowledge about them than I.</p>

<p><p>Then we embarked on the trek toward the museum district (a tad over 1 mile I&rsquo;m guessing) and I showed them my footprint in the concrete at the Children&rsquo;s Museum!  They, properly impressed, and I, pleased as punch, skated on and noticed a pile of well dressed people in the new(?) Health Museum. We paused to people watch for a bit and then got kicked off the property by a cop.</p>

<p><p>Toward home we skated, until I saw two skaters up ahead.  &ldquo;Bye!&rdquo; to Kim and David and caught up with two people who turned out to be named Mike and Mike, respectively.</p>

<p><p>To the hill at Miller Outdoor Theater we skated.  I trudged up and flew down the hill and then joined them chilling on a wall.  Mike was waxing up an edge of the wall to do some grinds.</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t feel too super comfortable being around them grinding (it marks up the walls and is certainly frowned upon by many people, especially those who own the wall) so I announced my departure and they ended up going with me. We trudged up and zipped down the hill and then toward headed toward the zoo.</p>

<p><p>The trek toward the zoo is short and dark and rather dangerous as the sidewalk crosses the miniature park railroad tracks twice, and may (or may not) be strewn with random sticks or pine cones.  Plus it twists and turns through the trees and I found it difficult to always see which way I needed to turn at a given moment.  Oh, and there are park benches occassionally along the edge, which would certainly inflict bodily damage if encountered at 15 miles per hour.</p>

<p><p>Speeding through this twisty path, I made it successfully through the first grove of trees, including across the tracks twice.  Then surprised a couple smooching on a park bench as I hauled by with a friendly &ldquo;hi,&rdquo; and then gone again into the second set of trees.  Again no problem and then up and over the wooden foot-bridge over a tiny portion of the lake.</p>

<p><p>Ahh&hellip;  yes!  made it without crashing!  I paused for a second to let them catch up.  Mike got there first, and then Mike was close behind.</p>

<p><p>We skated around to the other side of the lake in search of a water fountain.  Found it, slurped water, rested and talked.</p>

<p><p>Turns out Mike is a traveler; he&rsquo;s moved about a million times in the past several years of his life.  Part of me is envious, but I asked my higher self what would fit in my life in this arena.  The answer came back something like, &ldquo;I can take little road trips with my skates and frisbee and digital camera and laptop computer and travel and skate and meet people and see cool things or whatever and archive them here on my website.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Nice.</p>

<p><p>I gave Mike and Mike my cards (I often carry them when I skate) and we began a trek toward home.</p>

<p><p>Along McGregor we skated on the sidewalk and whoah deja-vu as we quickly reached where the sidewalk ends and I barely slowed enough to not crash when I hit the sand.  Mike and Mike were a tad behind me; they also didn&rsquo;t crash.</p>

<p><p>Then to Main Street, we turned right and skated facing traffic in the far left lane (left according to us; right lane according to the oncoming traffic) so we could see any cars before they squished us.</p>

<p><p>Mike and Mike turned left onto Sunset Blvd to go wherever they went, and I continued my trek home. Got honked at once, but didn&rsquo;t come close to crashing at all.  Zipped across Westheimer at Montrose as the light had just turned perfectly green for me, I jumped onto the sidewalk, down the curb into the intersection, right in front of cars waiting for their green light, up the next curb and gone.  I love that.</p>

<p><p>I was glad to find my car at Texas Art Supply where I had left it; I was tired and that shaved 200 yards off the distance I had to skate.</p>

<p><p>Home at about 11:30pm.</p>

<p class=date>11:45pm Tuesday 17 August 1999</p>

<p><p>Skated from TX art Supply down to Herrman Park around by medical center around rice University.  Oh- I zipped down the hill by Miller Outdoor Theater twice and around Rice and got ice cream at Walgreens in Rice Village area. and I met Gwen and Kelly and Darwin (&ldquo;Like Charles&rdquo;) and Roberta and then skated back toward my house along Hazard hauling ass and <font size="+1">BLUH LAM</font> I hit sand and my skates stopped and I fell <em>bang</em> on the sandy asphalt almost into a parked car.  Ow knocked the wind outta me and I rested for a sec.  Jeff waited there with me as others continued on (with my frisbee that I dropped in the process).  Caught up with the group and got my disk and said bye and broke off to say HI to Jennifer at The Mad Potter.  Chilled and talk talked about her life a lot and she invited me to go swim at her house.  Yes.</p>

<p><p>Swim was fun, watched Tarantula the kitten cutely play in the living room, climbing all over the couches.  Hugged and I went home.</p>

                        <p class=date>10 August 1999</p>

<p><p>Last night I went skating with a group called Inline Swine.  Far as I can tell, they don&rsquo;t associate themselves with the name so much as associating themselves with, &ldquo;we meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8pm at Texas Art Supply.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I found the group while skating alone downtown 3 weeks ago.  They were about a block away so I caught up with them. I discovered they were cool and they skate regularly so I may hook up with this group regularly!</p>

<p><p>Last night (back to the story) we skated about mmmm 12 miles?  Through lots of places I wouldn&rsquo;t go normally, simply because I didn&rsquo;t know they existed, or wouldn&rsquo;t feel safe by myself.  (mom, please note this example of common sense)</p>

<p><p>Skate skate skated from montrose and Fairview, down to Waugh, west along Memorial, then north through some back-ass streets until we crossed over I-10. As we were crossing this narrow bridge (it did have walls and a fence-cage over it, I waved and waved at the traffic!!  &ldquo;Hey!  Flash your lights!!!!&rdquo; for about 2 minutes and not a single car flashed its lights.  Not that they could hear me, but c&rsquo;mon some kind of acknowledgement is in order&hellip;  maybe a light tap on the horn or wave a hand out the window&hellip; something! Not this time.</p>

<p><p>On and on east across TC Jester and then stopped at Durham and 11th street in the Heights for drinks at a convenience store.  I was glad to stop.  I hadn&rsquo;t really skate-exerted myself that much in quite a while, plus I started out the night with kinda ripped up wheels on my right skate.  The back center wheel (inline skates) was shredded to the point of being useless.  Kinda like when a truck tire on the highway shreds, long strips of rubber peel off, I peeled off about 1 &amp; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pi worth of tread from my wheel hub.  (That&rsquo;s 270 degrees worth. (That&rsquo;s 75%.  (That is, my wheel was useless for skating.)))</p>

<p><p>Scott said it looked to him like my front wheel on the same skate was going to shred next.  Scott and Jeff and someone else offered me some hand-me-down wheels once we got back.  I absolutely accepted.  (If I could make it back.)</p>

<p><p>Through more back streets east of Shepherd as we headed back toward downtown, my remaining wheels seemed to work fine.  Back over I-10 on some street I waved at cars, and again got no response.  Hmpf.</p>

<p><p>Then we did more and more and more skating in a generally going-back type of manner.  Crossed over Memorial on Sawyer, which is kinda cool because Sawyer forms a nice hill over Memorial, allowing for a quick zip down the hill after skating up.</p>

<p><p>Got back to Texas Art Supply and was offered some wheels by Scott.  I thanked him profusely and said bye to all my new friends and skated home.  Put on the new wheels and I&rsquo;m excited about trying them out on Thursday!!</p>

                        <p><title>god, Y2K, dance, skate, connect, all in one day!</title></p>

<p class=date>1:11pm Saturday 19 December 1998 (10496)</p>

<p><br><font size="-1">(transcribed from my diary)</font></p>

<p>I just spent 2 hours online doing email and updating website and the SWD YRUU website.

<p>Yesterday was asesome! To kick it off, Glen called me back and was super exciting about signing up with Flashnet!  yay!!

<p>Then Ben Easton and I went skating around Rice University, got kicked off (gently) by a Rice Cop and went to eat at Bibas and discussed Y2K predictions, and our philosophies of god and cosmology. Ben explained logically why angels exist, but that god does not.

<p>Then to his house with the plan of some combination of talking, or watching <em>2001: A Space Odessey</em>, which he could hardly believe I had never seen.  (He has a framed poster for the movie in his living room)

<p>We talked for 2.5 hours, actually mostly he talked and described long windedly why he is for the death penalty. Something to the effect of, "it's our right to remove people who are a threat to society."  I debated, but didn't seem to make much of an impression.

<p>Then I went home a chilled a bit then met Sara at UH for an AH (American Humanics) party at the UC (University Center).  I met James and talked to him and we helped them get set up including walking to the Social Work building where AH is located via a semi-secret back door of the UC, labeled "Emergency Exit Only"
Much to people's surprise, there is no alarm on the door and we propped it open with some flyers so we could get back in.

<p>Back to the dance for an awards ceremony, then jazz music (ho hum) then Beastie Boys "Brass Monkey" which got me and Sara onto the dance floor then "Paul Revere" then some disco and by then a lot of the group was up dancing and we formed a Soul Train dance line and had a great time.  I even got Tinette's grandma to dance!

<p>I danced bouncily for like 1 hour including non-stop bouncing on my toes to the beat of House of Pain's "Jump Around" for the entire song.  <font face="arial" size="+1">GOD</font> my calves are sore!

<p>Left the party and called Manda who was still out and about. I almost went back to the party as a "poor me" reaction then realized that's not what I wanted. So I went home and put on my skates to skate downtown.

<p>It was 11pm, and I suddenly thought, Diane! and called her and turns out she was available to skate so we met downtown at our parking lot. I skated there and she drove.

<p>We skated around the streets, which was a tad challenging as they were a tad wet, and wound our way down to Bayou Place, (a brand new facility, including sweet movie theaters, 2 or 3 restaurants, a concert auditorium, a bar or 2, and valet parking, which is Houston's wonderful successful beginnings of getting a night life back downtown) and asked one of the outdoor bars for water and they were happy to oblige.

<p>We chilled like sweaty sore thumbs on skates in the middle of a well dressed yuppy theater district and I loved it!  We thanked the waiter and I tried to tip him but he said "don't do that; just come back later and eat."

<p>Across the street we went to gaze upon Buffalo Bayou, which was a tad overflowed (4 feet lower than what Jason and I had seen 2 days after it had been 25 feet overflowed) and I decribed to Diane how deep it had been.

<p>Amanda called at that moment on my cell phone and we made plans to meet back at Biba's (how ironic that I went twice in 1 day after not going there for over a year).  Diane and I slowly made our way back toward her car, which was about 12 blocks away at this point.

<p>Got to Biba's and magic happened when Diane and Manda met. Not like romance magic, but they connected on a professional level: Diane is a real estate agent looking to expand her business, and Amanda has had interest in getting her real estate license, but didn't really know how and <b>bing</b> it was amazing!

<p>They talktalktalktalked and I just ate my Greek Pizza and cleaned up the phone number list stored in my cell phone, keeping an ear toward the conversation.

<p>At one point, I pointed out that within 1 week of when Diane and I first met, I went to a palm reading party that she hosted which forever changed my life in a wonderfully positive way. I greatly hope the same type of impact happens for Diane and Amanda.

<p>Manda and I went home around 1:30am then slept in on this lazy Saturday.

                        <p><title>Skate to UH main campus</title></p>

<p class=date>5:45pm Wednesday 11 November 1998</p>

<p>Today after doing computer stuff, I decided it was high time I went skating.  (Who made that term "high time" ?)

<p>As I shut down my computer and my left hand brain, I wondered where to skate.  I wanted a challenge, and I didn't want to just skate downtown.
<br>I thought about going down Memorial Drive to the Picnic Loop in Memorial Park, but I didn't feel like messing with traffic on Memorial Drive.

<p>Not downtown, not Memorial Park... ah.. UH! Wende is there on campus; maybe I can go say HI to her.

<p>Called her up to confirm she was there and told her I might see her in a bit.

<p>"Okay!"

<p>Strapped on my skates after stretching my legs a bit, and wondered about how my ankle would hold up.  Last time I tried to skate about 1.5 weeks ago, it was like no way, jose'.  But today, it was okay.  yay!

<p>I headed straight down West Gray, which I haven't skated in a really long time. (Well, I skate West Gray to Montrose each time I skate but that is only 1 block)

<p>This time, all the way along W Gray until it split into two one way streets, Webster and Gray as it fit in with the other one way streets of downtown. The sidewalk was crappy in many places from neglect or construction, so I often found myself on the edge of the street, squeezing between oncoming traffic and the curb.

<p>Jump and leap and squat and roll roll roll I manuevered over, under, around all kinds of terrain, from grass infested sidewalk, to muddy splotches where sidewalk should be, to large wooden signs warning traffic of Road Construction Ahead. Not a single sign warned skaters of Crappy Sidewalk Ahead.  That's cool, though. I like the challenge.

<p>Along the edge of downtown I skated against traffic on Gray. That way a car doesn't sneak up behind me! I mostly stopped at red lights, but hauled through if cross traffic allowed. I skated past the taxis in line at the bus station, past where I used to turn to work at St Joseph Hospital, past it all, into a crunchy corner of downtown where the intersections have only stop signs instead of lights.

<p>Over to Pierce I veered, then across the gaping canyon of Hwy 59 that was still speeding along before rush hour started. Now I was out of downtown and into the poor neighborhood between UH and downtown.

<p>Now the sidewalks were really infested with grass, if they were even there at all.  But there was plenty of flat street on which to skate, as I was on the feeder of I-45 Southbound toward Galveston.

<p>Traffic whizzed past me and I was nervously in the far right hand lane. I wasn't going against traffic now, as I wanted to be on UH side of the highway... (I decided it wouldn't be worth crossing the highway later in order to skate against oncoming traffic now.)

<p>The sidewalk cleaned itself up and bing, I was at the intersection of Cullen, a main traffic artery to UH. 

<p>Along Cullen now, <em>push push push</em> I zipped along the sidewalk, off the curb, across a street, up the curb, <em>push push push</em> some more.

<p>Finally at Entrance 14 I found myself turning left across the street into the campus proper.  This was my part of campus. Familiar buildings and familiar expressions on people as I skated by, slowly absorbing the campus enegy.  I love this place.

<p>Over toward the big water fountain.  Not a lot of people here, so I didn't see anyone I knew. I skated to Scholars' Community, an organization on campus where I used to work.

<p>Tina, the lovely loud secretary was there, but busy talking to a student in her office with sliding glass door closed. So I waved and called her on the phone.

<p>She answered mockingly, "Scholars' Community."

<p>"May I speak with Tina Blakes, please?"

<p>"Just a moment."   She paused and changed her voice a tad deeper. "This is Tina."

<p>"HI!  This is Rob, but you're busy so I'm going to leave."

<p>"Okay..." and she told me that Rachelle had been there yesterday and that she had said HI.  Nice.

<p><hr width="30%">

<p>So I left and skated over to the bookstore to see Wende.

<p>Thankfully, she was standing at the front counter waiting for me. I would have felt uncomfortable skating sweaty stinking through the store to see her.

<p>HI!  I met her friend Kell, and Josie and someone else and Wende was all, "you stink."

<p>"Thanks!"

<p>We talked a bit more and I jokingly said I would not shower before we had dinner tonight.

<p>I left and skated off the other side of campus, where a brand new highway is being built from like I-45 toward Sugarland, I think.  The road surface was mostly complete, but still covered with debris and unused by traffic, except for a big water truck lumbering along behind me and then past.

<p>I turned right along what will be the feeder and skated along and up onto a bridge over some bayou. On the bridge was a large section of sewer pipe, unused and about 6 feet in diameter. I skated through that, of course. Up onto the bridge I noticed a ton of nails strewn across it. What had been nailed together?? Obviously there are aspects of highway bridge construction that I do not currently know.

<p>Turned around and skated down the slight incline, crouched and zipped through the pipe and turned at the intersection down toward what will be the other feeder. This "other feeder" runs along side some railroad tracks, which are in use almost all the time. What I found odd, though was the intersection kinda sloped down toward the tracks for no apparent reason.  It was a T shaped intersection, with the top part of the T being lower than the rest and tracks running along above it.  Why???

<p>Finally I decided that it must be planned so that if the intersection ever needs to become a + instead of a T, it can go right <em>under</em> the tracks!  BrillianT!  oops.

<p>Toward I-45 I skated along the clean new highway, and found the water truck being used to spray mud off from an asphalt surface where concrete will be soon.

<p>Time to head home.

<p>I wanted to get home before dark, cause it's safer, and not so cold. Oddly enough, I chose to cross I-45 in a hauling ass, scampering scared rabbit race on a crappy old crunchy broken 2 lane asphalt surface, with the possibility of speeding-home rush hour traffic behind me. <em>zzzzzzzoooommmmm</em> I half sprinted and half juggled between my skates to keep from being tripped in a rut or bump. Then up up up up a short hill I clambored, thankfully toward a light that was red.

<p>Somehow, not a single car tried to pass me. Thank you angels.
Good job, Rob.

<p>Leisurely skate along the sidewalk, which actually mostly existed on this side of the highway.

<p>As I approached downtown proper, the road I was on gets pushed over two blocks out of the way of a highway exit ramp. I didn't want to be two blocks over, but that traffic was speeding pretty quickly down the ramp.  Hmm.

<p>I decided to go for it, and actually found a lovely break in traffic after a white limousine sailed past. Nice.

<p>Past the weird road configurations of the beginning (or ending) of the HOV lane, I skated past parked cars and into downtown proper. Cool thing was that this time I was on St Joseph Parkway (it used to be called something else, but I don't remember what) and it was heavily congested with construction.

<p>I skated along the sidewalk, which abruptly ended in a hole about 8 feet deep. A construction guy saw me so I mocked falling into the hole. "whoah!"  He smiled and shrugged like, "oh well!"

<p>Ha ha that was funny.  Then my light turned green and zip zip zip zip I scampered across the street and onto the ample sidewalk beside St Joseph Hospital. The next light was still green so I just sailed across that street too.

<p>I pushed super hard to try to make one more green light before it changed and as I was just about to fly off the sidewalk into the street, I noticed that the taxi wasn't just parked, but slowly inching its way backward into my path!!!  <em>swerve</em> - <em>zoom</em> I zipped just past his bumper and across the street with the green light just turning yellow.  YES!!!

<p>Oh yes.

<p>I lazy skated for a bit and congratulated myself on slick manuevering. Pushed alongside traffic and regathered my breath for another scamper with the green lights. Whew. I recognized I was getting tired.

<p>After a bit, the lights turned green, as they seem to do, and I took off with the traffic.  I made only two lights this time (not including the one where I started) because I had to slow down a bit for a truck to turn the corner in front of me just before I careened across the intersection.

<p>Once I got out of downtown, I mostly just plodded along, having to work to jump the gaps in the sidewalk that I had easily leaped going the other direction.  I just pressed forward consistently and made it home by 5:30.

<p>5:30?  WOW!!  I made it to UH and back in 2 hours, including stopping to talk for 30 minutes, and including scoping out the new highway construction.

                        <p><title>Skated at Galveston</title></p>

<p class=date>13 October 1998</p>

<p>This morning I went to Galveston to skate.  

<p>"Galveston?" you may ask.  

<p>It's the city on the Gulf of Mexico 60 miles south of Houston on I-45.  It's where 3 lanes each direction of I-45 melts into asphalt surface road with lights at mile marker 0.  Galveston.

<p>So anyway, I drove there early this morning - like 8am and parked on Stuart Beach. I walked slowly around the beach and waded in the water, and even sat down in the shallow surf for a while, all while reading my new JavaScript book.  Ack.. can't get away from computers, even at the beach!!

<p>I enjoyed the sun and sea and birds and all and then I sat in the trunk of my car to read in the shade. I pored through seven chapters and found my brain was full.  

<p>Time to skate.

<p>Meticulously brushed my feet off before driving off the beach up to the sea wall, where I parked and put on my skates.

<p>There were very few people on the island (it's not actually an island, but it's close, so they call it that.) but I skated about 1/2 mile upwind and followed a driveway down toward the beach. I could see it led to an old parking lot of some sort, but I couldn't see exactly what.

<p>Over colorful graffiti I rolled, reading about who loves who for how long and who can bite what and who rules and who was where and all variety of stuff. Greenery squeezed out a living between the large slabs of concrete and an empty pay phone shell stood at the edge of the lot like a sentry.

<p>A rusted hand rail stood between the parking lot and another driveway that curved up toward the street again. Or did it?
I decided to follow the other driveway since it disappeared, curving into the tall weeds.

<p>More graffiti, this time a picture of a gun with a ridiculously large bullet leaving the chamber, and wait-a-minute! this driveway curves back around into a loop??  This was a go-cart track!!

<p>Mystery solved, I imagined what the facility must have been like when it was new.  Why did it go out of business?  How long ago?  Hmmmm.

<p>Back to the sea wall boulevard, and across to the other side, where the road surface slopes upward again, making a secondary sea wall.  Nothing to sea, er see, over the wall so I sped back down the slope and back across 5 empty lanes to the sea-side sidewalk.

<p>Wow. Now I was skating with the wind and it was soooo much easier!!  At the light for Ferry Street or Road or whatever, I turned right, toward the ferry. It was 1.25 miles away according to the signs, and I found it pleasing to skate past all the cars and trucks and a bus that were parked in line waiting for the ferry after they had all sped past me on the street.

<p>All the way up to the sign that read, "DO NOT CROSS THIS LINE UNTIL INSTRUCTED BY DECK HAND" I waited for the ferry to arrive.
I imagined a giant hand on the deck motioning for me to cross the line.

<p>By the time the ferry arrived, I was joined by some others intending to walk aboard.  The ferry docked and one of the Deck Hands walked past me and without stopping said, "you can't wear those on the ferry boat."

<p>I blinked.

<p>Hmmm. Do I want to go across the ferry, or do I want to skate?

<p>I want to skate.

<p>So I watched the whole process of loading and unloading of cars, intrigued by the nearly imperceptible listing of the ferry as the cars rolled off one side, then the other, then as new cars rolled on one side, then the other.

<p>But what was most impressive was the number of cars they packed on this thing.  The bus, a couple of 6 wheeler "cube" trucks, three short 18 wheelers, and a lot of cars. As they filled up the back of the ferry, I was all, "okay that's the last car." nope a van.. "okay, <em>that's</em> the last car." nope a couple more cars. Finally the last car squeezed on. An orange-ish red VW Bug.  Yeah.

<p>They closed the gates and began to pull away, and I skated past the ominous sign toward the churning waters behind the ferry.  The Deck Hands whistled to get my attention and waved me away. I smiled and waved back.  "Come get me!!!" I thought.

<p>Ah well..  

<p>Skated 1.25 miles back toward Stuart Beach and back to the 
sea-side side walk and again skated downwind for a while.

<p>Oh yes this is great!  I jumped up onto and down off of the concrete benches as I went past, swerved around sign posts, or between them if appropriate and had a great time. I watched some guys preparing rebar for a concrete driveway and even skated out onto a paved jetty on the end of which some people were fishing.

<p>The pavement was hardly smooth, so I abandoned the thought of going all the way to the end. In fact, I almost ate it once on the way back, as I skated pretty close to the edge and almost didn't make it jumping over a large gap in the rocks.

<p>But,  I did not wreck and made it safely back up the steps to the sidewalk.  Skate skate skate to another jetty, this one not paved, but just essentially cube shaped granite stones with a few inch gap between each one.

<p>Now <em>that</em> was a challenge to skate very quickly. Each instant I was stopped by a bump, rolling down a rut, stepping past something and jumping over the gaps all at once. Wow.

<p>Yes, I had my helmet on. Yes it was dangerous. No I did not fall. Yes I would do it again.

<p>A bit further down wind I skated and then realized, "wait-a-minute.. I'm going down wind!"

<p>I turned around and my car was out of sight. Not like, "hey baby, that car is <em>out of sight!</em>" but like really really far away.

<p>Oh yes.  I savored the delicious leg muscle burn as I tucked and pushed into the wind.  My lower back began to ache from maintaining the crouched position but I forged on.

<p>Okay, so I'm being a bit melodramatic, but the difference was quite significant. I had to act as my own cheerleader at the end to keep myself from stopping.

<p>Made it.

<p>Sweat literally poured out of my helmet when I took it off. Threw my sweaty helmet, skates, pads and socks into the trunk and headed home.
