                        <p><title>Skate and skate</title></p>

<p class=date>24 July 1998</p>

<p>Today I went skating!!  I totally was all like "I'm going skating" and I just decided to skate to Herrman Park and went basically down Montrose, a pretty heavily trafficked (sp??) 4 lane + turn lane street.  The traffic was a bit heavy as it was rush hour, so I mostly stayed on the rough and tumble sidewalks.

<p>The wind was pretty amazingly blowing against me; I looked forward to having it behind me on the way back!  I got to the park in about 20 minutes and I was hot!

<p>I met two skaters there and we goofed around the park a a bit, as a group pushing each other a bit more than we would have skated alone.. and we had a great time. 

<p>I never learned their names; only that they've been in the Houston area for a year and he's from Australia and I don't know where she's from.

<p>We skated down the hill that is the ampitheater seating for Miller Outdoor Theater and jumped up a wall thing and over the little park railroad tracks and we skated around the lake and just had a fun time.

<p>Then to Rice University we skated and I said "bye" to them at their car and *bing* I realized there was a drum corps competition going on!!

<p>Wow!!  So I skated over to where about 100 piece brass was practicing and rested and watched them perform.
They practiced until they had ten minutes till they had to march into the stadium.

<p>I watched several of the different groups practice I spent most of my time watching several color guards and they all had sabres!!  wow.  I loved watching and really longed to be back in the rifle corps from my high school days.

<p>Before heading back home, I got some water from a woman selling programs. I saved the cup she gave me so I could fill it on the way back toward home.

<p>On the way out I watched some drummers march and drum... I love watching the quads drum in perfect syncopation (even if I can't spell it).

<p>Refilled my cup and headed back.  The wind had essentially stopped so I didn't get the push I had hoped for, but the going was much easier.  I enjoyed that I was skating over crazy bumpy sidewalks and up and down curbs and around cars at intersections.. all while holding my glass of water.

<p>The coolest moment was when I was nearly home.
<br>A truck had just pulled up to the street along which I was skating and waited for traffic.  I confirmed that he saw me, so I knew I could safely skate in front of him across the street.  

<p>Just as I got near the curb, both skates hit a bump and I essentially bounced over it and off the curb and landed perfectly upright in front of the truck still with water in my cup.  That was cool.
</p>

                        <p><title>Skate and IMax</title></p>

<p class=date>11 July 1998</p>

<p>Each day this week, I've been working at the New Warrior Lodge.  (see <a href="https://Nottingham.com/warrior/">Men In Mission</a> for details) The biggest thing we did this week was mail out a couple hundred directories of men who have completed the training.  The coolest thing about the work is I get a hug each time I come in to the "office" and I don't have to wear shoes.

<p>Today after working at the Lodge, I did email and caught up with a lot of messages and updated the two youth group websites that I maintain, and actually updated the front page of a third youth website.

<p>I was stir crazy (whatever that means) and decided to go skating. I skated to the bank and deposited a check and went to Walgreen's and got some solution for my contacts. That took only 10 minutes and I wanted to skate more.

<p>So I dropped of the contact solution at my apartment and went back to the intersection of Taft and Allen Parkway.

<p>It's been totally hot as hell... like around 100 degrees, so I was sweatin' like crazy just getting near the intersection. 

<p>Panting, I watched the traffic light down the hill from me.  I counted off the 60 seconds until it was time for me to race down the hill to the intersection.  I got to 40 and the light turned green...  waitasecond!  I was expecting it to not change yet.. 

<p>So I stopped and recalibrated my timer..  I needed to count only 30 seconds.  Okay, fine.

<p>I skated back to the fire hydrant which is my starting marker. The traffic moved, indicating when I started my mental timer.  1...2...3...4... all the way up to 30 and

<pre>go go go go go go go</pre>

<p>down the hill and the light turned green perfectly on time and zoooom across the intersection to the first median and I paused there. None of this instant across the street ..  wait it's a big enough gap, so I zipped across the last 4 lanes and to the safety of the sidewalk.   Too easy.

<p>"Too easy!" I yelled.  "Too too easy."

<p>It was not so easy getting back across.  

<p>Like a caged beast, I paced up and down the sidewalk, looking for a break in the rush hour traffic.  Up the sidewalk.. nothing but cars whizzing by at 50 to 60 miles per hour.

<p>Down the sidewalk and nothing but cars whizzing by at 50 to 60 miles per hour.. It was the ultimate game of Frogger.

<p>and then I saw it, a break in the traffic and I skated off the curb into the first lane and then <em>zip</em> a car changed lanes, closing off my chosen path.    Back onto to the curb I stepped.

<p>Back up the sidewalk, looking for my moment to cross.  

<p>Back down, and finally on the back up again pass, I found it and zipped across to the median.  Yeah.

<p>From the median I zipped across the remainder of the street  and up to my starting point again.  Well maybe not zipped... I was plenty hot and just ambled my way up.

<p>I had to do it again..  that first time had just been too easy.

<p>From the fire hydrant I counted off 30 seconds.  Many cars and a two pickup trucks were now in line at my light.  I reached 30 seconds and began my race down the hill.  

<p>Down between the two lanes of cars I cruised, hoping that they wouldn't squish me as they got to move.. I changed my concern, though, as the light seemed to take spectacularly long to turn green, so I hoped simply the light would turn green for me.

<p>Just at the moment of abort, <em>green</em> and I zipped into the intersection before any of the cars began to move.  Aww yeah.

<p>To the median I sped and stopped there.. didn't even try to go all the way across.  I had to get back home for a shower before meeting Wende, Maggie and John for dinner at La Jaliscience.

<p>I ambled across the street and up the hill even more slowly and was so totally sauna-style hot and sweaty by the time I got back to my apartment..

<p>Took a shower, starting with pretty warm water so as to not send my body into shock.. slowly cooled it down till the hot water was totally off and I was basking in only cold water.

<p>Out of the shower and I was still hot, but had recovered by the time Wende and I got to the restaurant.

<p><font size=-1>(it's 11:30pm and I'm about to go to bed so I'll be quick)</font>

<p>John couldn't make it, so we called Eric and he said he would join us and then John showed up and then Eric showed up so all five of us ate and chilled and John decided to not join us for the IMax movie.

<p>I rode with Maggie in her new red Ford Mustang soft top convertible and we chilled at the museum until the movie.

<p><b>AMAZON</b> was the IMax movie, and the images were incredible, reminding me how much I really wanna go there.. especially seeing a railroad track wind around the sides of mountains!!  Totally wild.  The storyline they added was pretty hoaky, but oh well.

<p>Movie ended and we came home and here I am.

<p>I've decided to sleep outside on the top of the back staircase of my apartment building.. just because I can.

<p>good night.

<p>"Hi Spot"  He loves to be scritched. I love my Spotty. "hey spot" scritchy scritchy "I'll be back."

<p>clunk clunk clunk clunk down the steps. Down. Let's go!

<p>Smooth sailing out of the parking lot. down the drive to the street. cars coming I turn sharp onto the sidewalk.

<p>Over cracks, sticks, little seed pod things. Why do people have trouble with these? I just skate over them.

<p>Woman at the bus stop. "HI"

<p>She smiles.  Probably doesn't speak English. Probably is jealous I'm on skates.

<p>Cross the street. cars? behind me is clear. Slide across to the other sidewalk cause there is a car coming from ahead.

<p>Intersection I just sail around the corner of the boat shop. No one on the sidewalk. good.

<p>HI person in car in traffic wearing shirt and tie! I'm on skates, fucker! hahahaha!  That would be rude. He's probably jealous too.

<p>Rocks on sidewalk. why are they always right here? sail right over them.

<p>need to cross Montrose. No cars coming at me step off curb slide across the street uh oh cars leaving the intersection like greyhounds. Slide across to the next sidewalk. 

<p>oh man what a crappy-ass sidewalk. Bushes hanging in my way. stand up and slide past and the leaves scutter across my NO Fear shirt. grass growing into the sidewalk all broken up. step from piece to piece no problem. 

<p>Greyhounds that passed are now stuck at this light. I turn right onto Dallas. Cars behind? No. Hop off curb into street.
Get longer strides. 

<p>Ahhh. <pre>push push push.</pre> Yes. No cars. I slide across to other side of street, along construction fence, keeping me from the sidewalk. Oncoming traffic. Face them down. Get out of my way fucker. They change lanes. They all change lanes this time.

<p>Past the fence I hop back onto the sidewalk for a car to go by. See I can be nice too. 

<p>No cars. back onto street. <pre>push push push</pre> Nice. Intersection ahead. Taft. Almost there. I have a red light. Anything coming? no. well yeah. stop.

<p>Okay clear. wait for greyhounds to go by.  Across Taft to my ramp. My precisely timed acceleration runway.

<p>What was that time again? I think 20 seconds. Yeah 20. stop and wait for the count.

<p>Okay. cars on left are stopped at the light. Once they take off, count 20. Is that it? I think so. Feels right.

<p>Ow fuck. Van just went by. Jump up you are okay. I'm okay everyone! see look at me fuckin bad ass skater jump up and skate.  fuck that hurt!

<p>shake it off. analysis: everything moves okay. Skinned my right forearm. skinned my left forearm and upper arm. bruised my right hip. base of my right pinky hurts. Bones okay? I do a gentle all over body wiggle-dance. All bones are okay. Any deep bruised muscles? All muscles okay. I'm still skating. clothing? NO Fear shirt is fine. I look down and my shorts have three shredded holes on the right leg. fuckit. let's go.

<p>panting. skating. adrenaline electrifies. I can barely feel any pain. Hi jogger. yes, I'm quite fine. these? oh - nothing at all. mere scratches.

<p>rolling slow around the bend and up the hill. gentle pushes on this small asphalt sidewalk.

<p>Along Allen Parkway. Look it coulda been her in that little red car instead of the minivan. coulda been anyone.

<p>two teen age bicyclist chillin' watching me approach. do they see? did they whisper a comment? Probably. they're impressed that I'm still going.

<p>Across the small entrance to Allen Parkway. No cars. no problem.  down the slight hill.

<p>Car coming toward the next entrance.  too far away to matter. I cross no problem.

<p>Up around Sam Houston Park real slow just sliding through.

<p>Not at the intersection but no cars so I cross the street to the library in view of a bus pulling away from the stop.

<p>hey Mr Bus Driver look at my scrapes. He's probably busy.

<p>Down McKinney all the way to Louisiana Street. Lights are still timed for rush hour traffic. Cool. I don't get to skate that very often.

<p>Skate gently on the sacred white marble. Will they shoo me off this time?  apparently not. I'm just skatin casual. 

<p>Curb. Street. traffic trying to go home across my path. Last car goes by and I push across the intersection before the greyhounds get a chance to invade my space.

<p>Along another construction fence. man this one's been here forever. Here comes my next hill, down to Jones Plaza.

<p>In the lee of the fence I wait at the next intersection for my green light. Their light turns yellow and I go! Greyhounds will be attacking from behind. go go go go <pre>push push push push push</pre> go go go down the hill to the intersection green light. I'm in front of all the cars. <pre>push push push push</pre> across the intersection watch that lumpy manhole cover
down the hill past Jones Plaza tuck like a downhill skiier. no one is there at the Plaza to watch. Oh well.

<p>cop car is parked ahead does he care? Sail across next intersection cars are overtaking me but I'm sliding along the left hand side parked cars I am safe.  <pre>Sideways jump</pre> onto curb slow down on sidewalk.  Slow down .. slow .. gentle calm slow skating past the two cops talking. I'm just skating, sir. They don't say anything.

<p>Across the red carpet of Birraporetti's, turn left around the corner, where they can all see me while they're eating. Look at my blood, pasta eating nicely dressed folks. I'm skating and you're not.

<p>Sneak around the blind corner up the Alley Theater driveway thing. The building on the right is gutted.  but two nicely dressed folks are walking out the door.  hmmm.

<p>back around onto Jones Plaza I go in search of water. Gotta wash this shit off. oh it's going to sting. I can tell.

<p>up the steps <pre>clunk clunk clunk</pre> to the faucet. Turned the handle. nothing. fuck! why they gotta turn the water off?

<p>There's a guy chillin against the wall. Probably homeless. I ask him if he knows where I can get some water. He points out there are more faucets to try in each corner of the Plaza. cool.

<p>I check and the first two have no handles. Third one does. Turn it and it works. relief.

<p>rip the three velcro strips to get my right wrist pad off. <pre>rip rip riiip</pre> Three more for the left. keep the water running to clear out the pipe. Need sanitary water for this.

<p>look at pinky. holy shit! I have a hole scraped the size of a nickel under my right pinky. That's why it hurt so much! I let the water flow over it and relax into the pain, no it's not pain, just sensations coming from my hand. rinse rinse rinse it out.

<p>Okay, left elbow forearm scrapes. splash water up to rinse them off. I stick my elbow in the water flow for a second and relish the coolness of the water. Back out and feel the sting sensation. Relax into it. no pain.

<p>Right forearm scrapes. This one's not as bad. I splash water and gently wipe my watery hand over it. Not too bad at all.

<p>I turn the water off and go sit on the wall by a sign that begins "NO SKATES OR SKATEBOARDS ON PLAZA"

<p>I'm not skating I'm rinsing my arms. Oh Mr Politician would you rather I go to the hospital and cost the city five hundred dollars to get all bandaged up instead of a few pennies of water? I'm not hurting anything.

<p>Dude, chill. There is no one here. It's just a sign.

<p>My brain quiets as I watch a man painting a concrete wall.

<p>Across the street is Bayou Place, Houston's latest loveliest entertainment complex in downtown. Houston's going to be like San Antonio someday. Someday.  I love the city when it's alive.

<p>My scrapes are pretty much dry and I put my wrist pads back on. Now down the steps I gently step. Don't want to fall right now. Hey you won't fall unless you're nervous about falling. Okay. I'm not nervous all the way safely to the sidewalk.

<p>Across the street now on the back side of Alley Theater. Still rush hour traffic. 

<p>What do I want to do?  Go home?  No way. not yet.

<p>University of Houston is only several blocks away. Yeah. I love the hill. Across another street I cross while traffic is fully two blocks away.

<p>Up a hill I slowly push. Wow I am pretty trudgefully tired.

<p>I step up onto the sidewalk. It's a crappy one but I don't want to mess with traffic right now.

<p>I pass some people chilling by La Caraf. See my scrapes? Look, and I'm still skating. See? They don't comment.

<p>I reach Travis Street and stop for traffic. They are sailing down the hill to Interstate 45 to take them home. Their light turns red, so I hop out onto the street around another construction fenced off sidewalk and wait at the light with the cars.

<p>Other traffic light turns yellow as a van sneaks through at the last minute. I go. <pre>push push push push push</pre> go go go go down the hill in the unused parking lane while the traffic roars by. 

<p>Is that it? I look and that's it. I slide across to the right hand side of the street to the sidewalk and down the hill under the railroad tracks faster faster faster and I pull out my cell phone to call Wende.

<p>I push the buttons and listen as I sail to the bottom and back up the hill. <pre>push push</pre> gently up the newly paved asphalt driveway toward the ground level Police Station underneath University of Houston Downtown.

<p>phone is still ringing. She must not be there. Oh well. back into my pocket it goes.

<p>I cross the railroad tracks that are there and holy cow they've been ripped up! I look down the path where the tracks used to be and they are totally ripped up. All the ties are gone and the rails lay on the side like shoestrings. Extremely heavy shoestrings.

<p>I trudge up the driveway to street level, past two guys walking down wearing military looking uniforms. "HI" I say to each. See my arms? Look. see??  They don't comment.

<p>I arrive up at Main Street. I still have to trudge up the Main Street hill. A bus rumbles by. Another. I still press up toward the top, where people are waiting for even another bus.

<p>At the top. I chill and look out over where the railway used to be. The main line is still there. I wonder where the ripped up one goes. Or where it doesn't go anymore.

<p>I'm rested and ready to go down the hill. Not just go down. To fly down the hill at breakneck speeds, except I will not wreck. That was years ago that I wrecked on this hill. No worries. I've done it twenty times since then and never had a problem.

<p>But it is rush hour and the light is timed differently. I sit on the wall beside a sign that says "FORTY FOOT DROP DO NOT SIT ON WALL" or something like that. I didn't pay attention to it.

<p>Light turns red. I count. I get to 30 and it turns green. Perfect. I chill while it's green and wait for it to turn red again. I count. Fifteen seconds and 4 cars and a bus go by. 

<p>No traffic is headed down the hill so I jump off the wall.
Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen. I go. Twenty.

<p><pre>push push push push</pre> I pick up speed down the hill in the right hand lane. No traffic is behind me. I pause my pushing to <pre>jump</pre> over the evil groove of death that thwarted me so many years ago. <pre>push push push push</pre> again now tuck like a downhill skiier and I fly across the intersection.

<p>Crap. There were no cars to watch me go by.

<p>Oh well. I coast most of the way up the hill and then turn right on Franklin.

<p>I slide up to red light and it turns green as I approach. Perfect. Again <pre>push push push push push</pre> go go go go go over the insanely bumpy Travis and down the hill toward Brewery Tap, but all traffic must turn left as the bridge is out ahead. Look behind no traffic coming. the street is mine as I make a big sweeping left hand turn stepping skate over skate over skate over skate to turn. Traffic is watching.  I love that.

<p>Up the hill into cars stuck at the red light. I manuever in between them and over to the sidewalk. Traffic is done crossing in front of us so I go while we still have a red light.

<p>It's not red for long and the greyhounds race to pass me. Fine. I'm not racing uphill. You win.

<p>Up beside Kim Son I skate, past The Chronicle building on the other side of the street.

<p>Traffic is less crazy now as I get back to Jones Hall and Jones Plaza.  One more time down the hill. Okay.

<p>Back up to the lee of the construction fence I go and wait. Light turns green and I go go go go god i'm tired go go go down the hill watch the lumpy manhole cover tuck like a skiier down the hill I barely have any speed and don't even make it to the red carpet. That sucked. Time to go home.

<p>Back up Louisiana street I push past people and cars. I had a great time and I'm going home people. Thank you. Yes, I'm going home.

<p>But one more hill will be mine first. to Lamar Street which will scoop down and dump out onto Allen Parkway. I ride slowly along the sidewalks to get to the starting place.

<p>Two cars are at the intersection. Maybe three; I only care about the white car on the right, not the others. Light turns green and I take off and she tries to turn right in front of me.

<p>Hey! Where's your blinker?? I cut my acceleration and she stops and I take off again in a wide birth around her. <pre>push push push</pre> across the intersection and begin to zingg down the hill.

<p>hey weird, they are tearing down the building there. Another construction fence blocks the sidewalk. That's okay, I'm going to use the street anyway, thank you.

<p>Eyes back on street as I crouch down like a skiier and whizz past the fence and down the hill. Yes I am tired and stop to look out over Sam Houston Park for a second.

<p>Hey cool. they built a small wooden bridge over part of the water.  Good deal. I like all this construction going on.

<p>I visualize myself skating over the wooden bridge before I begin again to trudge up the hill to Allen Parkway.

<p>No cars are coming and I'm safely across to the sidewalk.

<p>Now it's just the long trek back toward where I had my accident. Will there be blood?  will I be able to see it at all? I assume so, since the lamp post is my marker.

<p>I see a bicyclist again in the parking area. Is he one of the same ones I saw earlier? I'm not sure.

<p>Along the path I cruise, not slow, not fast. No worries and I'm just skating.

<p>Down around the big field and up by some azaleas and back toward the straight bridge sidewalk again and there's my lamp post.

<p>I roll up to it and clearly see two black streaks of plastic shreds on the concrete.

<p>Ah. there. I see a smoother streak. I get down on my hands and kneepads. yes. hair. Little arm hairs shaved right off my arm. I smile. Wow.

<p>I don't see any others. I get up. Wow.

<p>One last big traffic crossing to get to Taft. Allen Parkway traffic does not have to stop, and they fly like fifty miles per hour down the hill.

<p>I see a break in traffic and go for it, just as this traffic's left hand turn lane light turns green. Nice.  I scoot across Allen Parkway and into then across the line of cars turning left. Up the curb then down the curb and I scoot across the other half of Allen Parkway and up the curb and down the curb and across the feeder road and up the curb to the sidewalk.

<p>Practically home free. But still gotta trudge up this hill. I press my way up, past a woman carrying what looks like a cheesecake out of Antone's. Cool. Cheesecake.

<p>Up to Dallas Street, the light is red for Taft so I cross over to the other side and along the Dallas Street sidewalk. No traffic so I cross Dallas Street to the other side. I like to face traffic when I skate so they can't sneak up on me.

<p>All the way up Dallas I go to Montrose. I would just bust across but there's a cop car on the other side. No reason to get in trouble now after all this.

<p>I pant and sweat and wait for the light to turn green.

<p>Damn it's taking forever and I coulda crossed twenty times by now. It turns green and I cross once.

<p>Along Montrose almost to West Gray, and finally someone who understands. A guy carrying skates is walking toward me. I bend my elbows to show my trophies. I smile, "How's it going?!"

<p>"Damn" he says.

<p>fwew. West Gray. Only one point five more blocks to go. No traffic so I slide across the street to my side. Up the driveway and around the back.

<p>Do I take my skates off now or wait until I get upstairs? Wait. You don't want to carry them up. Good point.

<p>Clunk clunk damn there's Spot again. At least he's on a different step this time. Sorry Spot I can't pet you right now. Gotta clean up.

<p>Keys in my pocket? Yes. Chain wallet is in the way. I pull the chain and out it comes. The chain. No wallet??! What the hell, the wallet was ripped off my chain when I wrecked.

<p>The wallet is still chillin' in my pocket, but wow. it got ripped off the chain!

<p>keys. door. unlock. inside. turn on fan. sit.

<p>Wow. Wrist guards off. One stinky skate off.  Another stinky skate off. One, one, two, two stinky socks off. Helmet off. Sweat pours in a small stream onto my shorts and shirt.

<p>Stinky shredded shorts off. Shirt off. Underwear off. Shower on. Oh this is going to sting.

<p>No it's not. Chill. Relax into it.

<p>Water feels cool on my feet and hands. Pinky doesn't hurt.

<p>Right elbow in. Right elbow out. It doesn't hurt so I rinse it all out. I get the soapy soap and soap it all up. I just relax and feel no pain.

<p>Left elbow same thing. Wow. just feel the sensation. Not pain. Just wash as if everything were normal. No pain. Amazing.

<p>I get out and dry off with a clean towel. Neosporin and bandages all right where Wende put them in a medical kit for me months ago. Nice.

<p>Right elbow first cause it's the smaller one. gauze, tape, forgot the neosporin. untape. neosporin. tape. done.

<p>Left elbow. gauze tape forgot the neosporin. untape. neosporin. tape. done.

<p>Pinky. neosporin. gauze. tape.

<p>I'm too tired to clean up anything. 

<p>Phone off.

<p>Lie gently in bed.

<p>Relax.

<p>Sleep.</p>

                        <p><title>Skating</title></p>

<p class=date>14 May 1998</p>

<p>I just got back from skating downtown with Diane. It was the first time we've skated in months! And before that it was like half a year before we had skated!

<p>I excitedly described the hopes and visions I have for the cluster, and that I'd like to create a position where I can actually make some dollars doing that which I love.

<p>Diane asked about the new phone number for Wende that's indicated on my answering machine. I explained that she moved out and the conversation turned to how Wende feels about me making dollars as a youth advisor. After hearing the situation, Diane quickly articulated how I could sell the idea of creating a paid position for Wende as well!

<p>I had never thought of such a possibility of having <b>two</b> paid positions because I can hardly fathom <b>me</b> getting paid for it.  Wow.

<p>We first skated to Jones Plaza where I noticed there were surprisingly few skaters! When we got up there, we were asked to sign an IpromisenottosueifIbustmyass waiver before we go in.

<p>Diane was pretty entertained reading the legal jargon. However, we were not sufficiently entertained to sign it.

<p>Down the street to a parking lot we went where I got a call from Ms Wende on my cell phone. I described to her the idea and I think she liked it. We'll have to talk about it later.

<p>Wende was entirely pissed and sad that I was out skating with Diane. We spent nearly 10 minutes on the phone while Diane skated in big circles around the parking lot.

<p>Once I got off the phone, Diane was all, "well, did you tell her that we are just friends and not interested in a sexual relationship?" No I hadn't.

<p>Diane encouraged me to call her back, so I did and that helped a lot.  Thank you, Diane.

<p>Then we cruised out to our parking lot at the base of the Main Street hill.  (That's the hill by University of Houston Downtown campus, quickly down which I love to skate.)

<p>We spent probably 30 minutes there, skating in large circles around the parking lot, with me jumping up and down a pair of sequential curb things. (Yeah that makes sense)  Anyway, it was like two curbs right in a row, so I jumped up then down then back up in a tiny little space. Pretty fun stuff.

<p>After a while, we headed back, but stopped by Jones Plaza for me to go car surfing. Well, Diane stopped and I went up the street to catch the next green light pod of traffic. Just as I arrived, the light was fully green and the cars were zipping through so I made a tight turn and joined their ranks.

<p>push push push push until I was up to speed and just behind a long Oldsmobile looking car. I was slightly to his right so he could turn left in front of me with no problem.

<p>Zing through the light and he didn't turn left but he's slowing down.... So I look to the right (it's clear) and slide right into the next lane of traffic and pass the Olds. whhiishh!

<p>There's a car fully slowed in front of me so I slide back left in front of the Olds and zip through the light. Perfect! Push push push push through and keep angling left toward the curb and hop onto the sidewalk to stop.

<p>I love doing that!

<p>Diane clapped for me as I skated back up the hill to her.

<p>"Did you see me pass that car???" I was out of breath.

<p>"I <b>did</b> see it. Wow!"

<p>Yay! That was super super fun.

<p>We skated slowly back up Louisiana and stopped by for cold water at the YMCA before getting back to her truck. We took our skates off and stretched and she brought me home and here I am.</p>

                        <p class=date>Thursday 27 November 1997</p>

<p><b>Happy Thanksgiving!!</b></p>

<p>I just got back from skating all around the Thanksgiving Day Parade
in downtown Houston.  I started at a lazy 10:00 in the am, strapped on
skates and skated all the way down Dallas Street toward downtown.  As
I approached, a small fragmented crowd of parents and kids and baby
strollers dispersed away from where I knew the parade must be.  Was it
over already??</p>

<p>I was certain it was certainly not, so I continued until I found
that half the parade had ended, and the other half was slowly catching
up. I skated upstream along the sidewalk behind the crowd, watching
the marchers, twirlers, dancers, floats, giant balloons, clowns, more
marchers, a guy on one of those old timey big wheel bicycles, and to
end it all, some low rider cars and trucks with hydraulics, neon
lights, chrome, plush velvet interiors and bumpin' bass for the whole
crowd to enjoy.</p>

<p>I had missed the skaters... sigh..</p>

<p>As the crowd flooded the street behind the cop cars behind the low
riders, I scooted to the other side of the parade to skate upstream
till I caught up with the end of the route.  One band was playing that
Dr Who song: "Dr Whooooo... (YEAH!)  Dr Who.  Dr Whoooo... (YEAH!) Dr
Who" and on and on.  I joined the crowd cheering the (YEAH!) part.</p>

<p>Once I reached the front-most part of the parade at the end of the
route, I skated around to get a closer look (in daylight this time) at
the floats Jim and I had seen last night.  They were pretty cool,
especially since I could see the hinges, cables, rods, and all the
technology behind the magic.</p>

<p>I went over the check out the big balloons that were being
deflated. At one balloon were some guys grouped around a vent,
breathing the helium and talking in chipmunk voices.  That was pretty
funny, especially when one squeaked, "it's-a-dream-come-true!"  I
chose not to inhale such a percentage of helium (though I'm not sure
the prevailing ingredients in Houston air are much better), especially
when the guys started going, "oh.. whoah.. that's enough of
that..."</p>

<p>I followed my nose toward Sam Houston Park and found the Urban
Animals!  They are the local big skate group, and the ones that skated
in the parade.  I said HI to John M, who owns the Montrose Skate Shop
from which I purchase all my skating stuff, and he grabbed my frisbee
and we started playing!  The crazy thing was that all the Urban Animal
dudes and dudettes played frisbee wearing their skates in the grass,
making for clumsy (although sometimes impressive) catches, and a few
spills.  I played barefoot of course, despite Greg hollering, "Hey!!
you gotta wear skates!"  I hollered, "no way, man!!" and mentally
hollered "gimme my frisbee back!"</p>

<p>We played for like 20 minutes until they all got tired and I played
with the younger kids who were there.  One girl looked about 6 years
old and she could catch and throw pretty consistently well!  I was
impressed.  Finally they all left and I put on my skates and just
bummed around a bit to see what I could see.</p>

<p>I saw basically nothin' so I zooomed at super top full speed ahead
down the hill leading to Allen Parkway.  That was pretty fun so I did
it again after catching my breath.</p>

<p>The second time I kept skating down Allen Parkway toward home.
Once I got to the intersection at Taft, where I needed to turn left
across Allen Parkway, I was zip zip zipping in a large left turn and
almost slipped crunch as a car was approaching with a more rapid pace
than I would really enjoy being hit by a car.  With that incentive, I
did *not* fall, and scurried the rest of the way across to safety.</p>

<p>The rest of the journey home I spent in slow deliberate
contemplation about the virtues of skating safely.</p>

                        <p class=date>27 November 1997</p>

<p>Last night Jim E and I embarked on our Third Annual Thanksgiving
Eve Skate.  He got to my house at like 9:30pm (after my dad and I saw
<em>Alien Resurrection</em> with Sigourney Weaver; it wasn't that
super great of a movie; see it at matinee price.) and we drove to
downtown to begin our adventure.</p>

<p>Once on skates, we cruised down to Jones Plaza where there were
many buses full of performers who had just practiced their dance
routines for the parade.  Down the hill by Jones Plaza I picked up
speed and then slide between the parked buses like a mouse through a
tall but simple maze.  I was only slightly worried about people
stepping off the buses through the doors that were all open.</p>

<p>We emerged in front of the buses without incident and Jim asked one
of the motorcycle cops if they needed help escorting the buses out.
The cop was all laffin' "yeah, that'd be great."</p>

<p>Jim and I got many waves from the passengers as we waved and
hollered at them as they went by.  I chased the last bus for a few
blocks until they were moving entirely too fast for me to keep up.</p>

<p>We skated then to our favorite parking lot to play frisbee, and
much to our astonishment, there were cars parked in our lot!!!  We
said HI to the valet dudes who were there and they said Wednesday
through Saturday they would be parking cars there in the evening.  I
couldn't believe it!  cars in our frisbee lot!!</p>

<p>Up the hill leading to UH Downtown, and enjoyed the view of the
bayou and railroad tracks and jailhouse.  Then I picked up major speed
down the other side and found it a fun challenge to turn without
braking and without getting smooshed by an oncoming truck.  The truck
was oncoming really close to me, but I still had to watch out for it.
Jim used his brake most of the way down the hill so the truck had
passed before it mattered.  His only concern was the few stairs that
were at the bottom of the sidewalk!  Fortunately, he just zipped
straight over them and just dropped down the few feet to street level.
(I think I'd like to try that sometime!)</p>

<p>We purposely climbed down a few more steps so we could speed down
the sidewalk leading down along the bayou.  I went first, and didn't
use my brake, so I was on full alert as I sped down around a slowly
curving blind corner.  Yikes!!!  Mud ahead!  There was a teeny clear
section on the left of the mud, through which I zipped, then
immediately stopped and turned around to warn Jim before he might hit
the mud and mess up his skates.  I was worried that I might get
smushed by him as *he* sped around the blind corner, but fortunately
the timing worked out perfectly and disaster was avoided.  Shew!!</p>

<p>That was fun..  :)</p>

<p>We rolled slowly along the rest of the sidewalk between the bayou
and jail, then up the stairs where Jim happily greeted the guys
standing out in front of the building.  I felt a bit uncomfortable,
but I didn't want to *act* like a felt uncomfortable, so I just skated
in gentle circles until Jim was done conversing, which didn't take
very long because they weren't too talkative.</p>

<p>Then we skated up to the George R Brown Convention Center where we
had found the floats last year.  I told Jim about what kinda stuff I
have on my webpages, and the conversation turned to me describing
stories about Thunder Rabbit.  I might just be inspired to write some
more.</p>

<p>At the GRBCC, we found the floats again.  There were three out in a
parking lot and four inside the building.  They had the standard big
turkey one with spinning tail feathers, and the rest were really cool:
<br>One had a Santa Claus rocketship sleigh rocketing out from about a 15 foot diameter model earth;
<br>another had something else;
<br>another had huge ornate clocks surrounding a head of Grandfather Time;
<br>and another had a huge wheel of long brass musical horns that would spin like the turkey's tail feathers.</p>

<p>After we got kicked out of the building, and saw everything in the
parking lot, we skated and played frisbee in a different parking lot
across from the Center.</p>

<p>There was a light wind, which made throwing more interesting as I
skated a huge circle around Jim and we tossed the disc back and
forth. We both made a few cool catches and cool throws.  After about
20 minutes I was pretty tired.</p>

<p>We wound our way through the quiet streets back to where we parked
by Fuzzy's and chilled for a bit before taking off skates and heading
home.</p>

<p>I just got back from my latest Wild Skating Adventure!</p>

<p>I tossed my skates and stuff into the back of Wende's truck and
drove to UH Downtown as she was getting off work.  She stepped out of
the building as I was in the back of the truck putting my skates on.
I offered to take her mail to the post office, since it wouldn't take
me as long to get there, but she declined the offer.  Fine.  We hugged
and smooched and were just about to leave when I heard a train
coming!</p>

<p>The main entrance to University of Houston Downtown is three
stories from the ground.  Fortunately, Main Street helps make the
entrance more easily accessible.  Underneath the Main Street bridge at
that point one can find Buffalo Bayou winding its sloggy way to merge
with another bayou, and not one but two sets of railroad tracks that
merge near the jail across from UHD.</p>

<p>The train was traveling southeast at 20 miles per hour and the wind
was blowing from the north at 5 miles per hour.  If I were to jump off
the bridge into one of the 10 railcars carrying gravel, where would I
end up?</p>

<p>This question begs to be answered one day, but not today; I'll keep
you posted.</p>

<p>The train passed, and Wende was still there watching me watch the
train, I guess to make sure I didn't try anything too outrageous..</p>

<p>I went to check out an aluminum framework pyramid that is
apparently going on top of the roof somewhere.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Then toward the street to speed down the three story hill to the
intersection below.  The timing of the traffic lights is different
during rush hour than normal, so I wasn't sure if it would stay green
for me or not.  I felt like it would, so I hauled-ass down the hill,
passing a dark sedan and almost passing another car; I could see that
the driver was watching me through his rear view mirror.</p>

<p>I pushed up the next hill and turned right onto Franklin (ya know- one
day I'm going to turn left onto Franklin, because there is also a hill
going down that way!) toward the road-blocking construction at the
bottom of the hill, and I made a wide left turn onto the street before
the construction, and look up and there's Wende!</p>

<p>Ha!  I passed her and we each waved, (though neither of us saw the
other wave) and headed toward the post office passing all the traffic
in which she was jammed.  One more intersection to go, and I got
stopped by traffic going the other way.  There was no crosswalk toward
the post office, and I had no easy way of getting across with two cops
there encouraging traffic to keep moving, thereby preventing me from
crossing the street.  Wende drove by and into the parking lot.  Dang.
She won.</p>

<p>I didn't see her as I went back toward downtown, with no particular
goal in mind.  I ended up at Jones Plaza, where on Thursday nights
they have Party on the Plaza.  The guards wouldn't let me in because
the band wasn't there yet so I went to play in traffic.</p>

<p>Up Louisiana street to go car surfing during rush hour traffic I
went, and paused by a construction barrel to catch my breath.  The
lights were just turning green to allow traffic on Louisiana Street
the right to careen toward home after a hard day's work, so I waited
for the next cycle.  After a few moments the cross traffic had the
right of way.  Once their light turned yellow, I took off.</p>

<p>My takeoff wasn't as fast as I had planned; I forgot quite how
trapped I was by the construction barrel and barriers.  Too late to
turn back, though, so I pushed hard down toward the Plaza.  Rush hour
traffic patterns are quite different than what I'm used to.  These
guys didn't want to turn left before the Plaza, but were intent on
going straight toward I-45.  (Didn't someone tell them the road is
blocked down at Franklin?)  I sailed down the hill without a problem and
turned at Birraporetti's, where it was fairly packed with people, many
of whom looked up as I went by.  (Maybe at night they can't as easily
see out the windows..)</p>

<p>Into the valet parking exit I proceeded, breathing hard yet
politely nodding HI to the few well dressed people standing in there.
This time I used extreme caution when exiting toward the next street;
I assumed cars would speed toward home on it as well.  I was
correct.</p>

<p>I was fairly pooped, and sat on my recovery wall for a while to
determine my next move.  Turns out my next move was to go home.  I was
really tired.</p>

<p>Up Louisiana Street toward Walker, which leads to Allen Parkway using
a hill down which I hadn't skated in a long time, I cruised along the
sidewalk, being careful of professionally dressed people and a car
that poked its nose out of a garage as I approached.  I would have
been careful of non-professionally dressed people, but there were none
in my way.</p>

<p>Cars fairly packed Walker, which was blocked by construction down
to two lanes.  I eased up between the barrels and traffic, knowing the
light would change just about as I got to it.  Light turned green, and
I took off across the intersection and pushpushpush down the hill and
I can hardly see because of the sun but whhheeehhheeeeewww!!!
zinngg!! I fly down ahead of the traffic, right along the striped line
so they can pass on either side if they want.  No one passed, and my
striped line turned into a median as the road split.  I grunched
slowly to a halt on the sharp gravel surface, wincing at the thought
of my new wheels getting chawed by the rocks.  No time to cry though,
as the traffic has all but stopped at the yield sign to get onto Allen
Parkway.  I hop onto the smooth street beside them and push my way
toward the top of the hill and turn right onto the asphalt
sidewalk.</p>

<p>I leisurely press forward up the hill along Allen Parkway, prepared
to offer a friendly HI to any joggers or bikers with whom I make eye
contact.</p>

<p>Apparently I can save my HIs for another day.</p>

<p>Soon I am approaching Taft, and I hope to cut across Allen Parkway
as soon as there is a break in traffic...  I keep looking over my
shoulder, but the traffic never stops.  I have to turn around and try
again.  This time is actually more fun, because I am facing oncoming
traffic as I haul across the street to the not quite so sharp median.
Then the traffic light helps me get the rest of the way across and I
head up Taft Street.</p>

<p>"Ya know... I wonder if I can get the hang of this intersection?"</p>

<p>That was my exact thought I a pushed up the hill.  I had my watch
with me, so I could easily time it.  Cool!</p>

<p>So I sat on the side of the street a moderate way up the hill and
watched the light.  After a few cycles, I see that my light turns
green for about 5 seconds, and then yellow and red until green again
about 45 seconds later.  Unless there are cars trying to turn left
onto Taft and it turns green about 55 seconds later.  No problem.</p>

<p>I waited until 40 seconds after my light turned red, and then
pushed down the hill.  "Turn green.  Turn green. turngreen turngreen
turngreenturngreen."  My light didn't listen, and didn't turn green
until I had already stopped all my momentum.  Back to the top of the
hill let's try this thing again.</p>

<p>I changed how I approached the problem.  The cross traffic got their
green light for 40 seconds each time.  Didn't matter if traffic was
trying to turn left or not.  So I waited until they had the green
light for about 33 seconds and then started down the hill.  I
approached the bail-out point and the light turned happily green for
me.  Yesss!  I sped through the intersection and turned right onto
Allen Parkway, where the cross traffic was waiting to go.  It worked a
little too well!  I was too far up the street to have much time to
jump onto the median and plan my path across the other half of Allen
Parkway!  So I just jumped onto the median and stopped.  I turned back
around toward the cars who now had the green light.  I waited for them
to pass, then headed victorious up Taft.  Excellent.</p>

<p>From there I just went straight home and here I am.</p>

<p>I just got back from my latest Wild Skating Adventure.</p>

<p>Starting from my apartment, I skated over to Empire Cafe' to meet Diane, one
of my skater buds.  We chatted for a bit while I got some water and then she
got on her skates and we went.  We did not really have a destination in mind
except maybe to skate along Fannin street to find some lilies for Wende, who
is returning tomorrow at 9am from Hawaii!  (I'm totally excited about that.)</p>

<p>Diane and I went down a street called Hazard, which is actually quite a nice
smoothly paved asphalt street.  Toward Hermann Park we skated, and rested at
a cool fountain surrounded by a ring of Roman column looking things.  I went
flying around the fountain, working hard to stay on the ring of steps, and I
found that the columns alternately blocked and allowed the sound of splashes
to reach my ears, causing a cool audio effect that reminded me of some song.</p>

<p>We rested there for a while, then skated toward the Medical Center.  The
coolest thing was being essentially right underneath the Life Flight helicopter
as it took off, blowing leaves and dust everywhere!  We skated a bit down 
Fannin, while I swerved around the various obstacles in the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Then to Rice University, where we skated up into the stadium.  Diane took off
her skates and ran the bleachers and around the field while I skated around to
the other side of the stadium to find out why I heard people cheering over 
there, but could see no lights.</p>

<p>I found people yelling encouraging cheers to some bicyclists, who were possibly
practicing for some marathon.  The track was lit with headlights of cars aimed
along the track in the direction they were biking.  Pretty cool.  It made me
nostalgic for my college days.<p>

<p>Back around to the other side, where Diane was just putting on her skates after
running the length of the field and around the track 3 times or so.  Wow.
I decided it would be a good idea to skate down the steps to the field and then
run up the steps.  I found it was not a good idea to skate down, so I carefully
walked down, sometimes waving my arms wildly to stay balanced.  
Made it to the bottom and then ran up clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk
all the way to the top without missing a beat (or a step).  That was cool.</p>

<p>We watched some guys practice hitting some baseballs in a batting net (like a 
batting cage, except it's a net) for a while and then cruised.</p>

<p>Rolled around the super smooth asphalt parking lot and then decided it was
about time to get back.  On the way back, however (still well within Rice
campus), a Bronco or Blazer or something drove by with about 20 people piled
into it.  Wow.  They drove past us- and had about a 150 foot lead on me
(plus 15 miles per hour) when I decided to catch them.  I just took off- 
skated as fast as I could for probably a bit over 100 yards.  I honestly
wouldn't have caught them except that they stopped for the stop sign.
Woah- I had trouble stopping quite in time; I ended up beside the truck.
As they drove off, I latched onto the back, in which were sitting four people
crammed side by side.   I was fully out of breath, unable to say anything like,
"HI!  I'm Rob.  I like to skate."  They pretty much didn't say anything either,
just snickered at a crazy skater who would latch onto their truck for no
reason.  The driver smiled and waved at me in the mirror, and just continued
on as if I weren't there.   They pulled me all the way to the stadium and I
let go just as they turned to where it got really rocky and wet.  "See ya
later!" I called, thinking that was a silly thing to say.</p>

<p>Still totally winded, I headed back toward where I had left Diane with 
essentially no warning.  She had skated about a third of the way I had been 
pulled when I met up with her.  Still totally winded, I said, "I had to do
that.  Thank you."</p>

<p>We cruised back toward Empire Cafe, by way of Hazard most of the way.  Diane
offered to drive me home, but I felt like I wanted to skate.  I'm glad I did
because as I skated by the people chillin' outside, Eric saw me and said HI.
The crazy thing is that Eric is the guy who owned the ramp that I jumped and
busted my head without a helmet.  Wow!  It's been probably a year since I had
seen him, and I actually didn't remember at first who he was.   (See <a href="/skate/skate06.html">Wild 
Skating Adventure Six</a>, which describes that accident.)   I continued on my
way and saw John, who owns the Montrose Skate Shop, where I buy all my skating
equipment!  I said HI to him for a bit and then continued on.</p>

<p>I had a brief non-contact interaction with a car that turned where I didn't
expect, so I cranked a turn out into the street to avoid him as he locked
his brakes.  Fortunately the street was pretty much empty, and I just skated 
across the street and up the curb to a parking lot.  No problem.</p>

<p>Skated the rest of the way home and here I am.</p>

                        <p class=date>8 March 1997</p>

<p>Today is a wonderful Saturday, and I spontaneously decided this morning to 
skate.  Started at my apartment,  through the intersection which is no longer
under construction, down Taft to Allen Parkway (where the light didn't agree
with me so I had to go slowly through the intersection) and toward downtown.</p>

<p>I skated gently to Jones Plaza, where I was surprised to find some guys
digging a trench through one side of the block.  Turns out they had dug down
to the top of the parking garage, which had sprung a leak inside, to fix the
leak.  Cool.  They had simply unearthed a seam in the garage ceiling and were
squishing down into the seam pink styrofoam noodles, which they would later
cover with tar or something.</p>

<p>Then I followed my skates to Market Square, where traffic was blocked for
BrewFest, and giant marketing thing with lots of barbecue and beer.  Wow.
I was super excited.  They had set up lots of cones and barriers and all
sorts of fun obstacles just for me to skate around!</p>

<p>That got boring after a while, so I skated to University of Houston Downtown
campus, where I watched the construction dudes deconstruct their scaffolding
after completing part of the construction on which they had been working.
Then I skated super fast down the hill and then toward The Wortham, where I
met two people just putting on their skates.  They are Emily and Chad, and
were skating for about the third time.</p>

<p>Emily was not too excited about skating in the streets, so I suggested we
go to Jones Plaza, where the top surface is nice and smooth and a great
place to practice.   I taught her and Chad how to use their brakes to stop 
easily, while I goofed around with my frisbee and around the trees and short
walls.  They got much better in a short amount of time, and then we went to 
the BrewFest to poke around.  We looked around a bit, and then they had to
leave so I gave 'em my number and we parted ways.</p>

<p>I skated pretty quickly to Hermann Park, about 5 or 6 miles away.  I first 
went to the 5000 lb. granite sphere that is supported by a teensy thin layer
of water, allowing it to be spun any direction.  The plaque was missing (again)
so I told the few people who seemed interested that it was not just "pretty
heavy," it was 5000 pounds.</p>

<p>Then to Miller Outdoor Theater, to skate down the hill while watching for cars
and pedestrian traffic, and navigating some stout wooden posts and parked cars 
at the bottom.  I had watched for cars coming from left to right, and realized
I had neglected to watch for cars coming from right to left when I ended up in
their lane at the bottom.  Fortunately, there had been none, whether I watched
them or not.</p>

<p>Then to the zoo area, where there is a large steam locomotive heavily rusting
behind an iron fence.  Today, however, there were some guys working on it.  I
went to investigate, and it turns out that anyone can volunteer time or money
to the restoration of this locomotive!  I will be there next Saturday, I told
Stan, who told me about their efforts.  (If anyone in Houston is interested,
they meet at about 9am Saturday, weather permitting.  Bring hammers, crowbars,
paint brushes or any basic tools you may have.)</p>

<p>I skated a bit around the lake, racing the small train as it traveled through
the park.  I found a point where I could wait until the end of the train had
passed me, then skate fast fast fast and beat the train at the next intersection
with the sidewalk.  (Note, however, two things.  (1) I didn't actually cross
in front of the train; I just made sure I was going fast enough to do it. 
(2) It's a small train, like the ones you see in parks)  I chose not to be a
bad influence for the little kids who were watching.</p>

<p>Skated back to the theater, to skate down the hill once more.  I watched for
cars and people coming from both directions this time.  No problem.</p>

<p>By then, I was pretty tired, so I went home and took a nap.</p>

                        <p class=date>1 March 1997</p>

<p>Last night I skated hard for the first time in a long time.  It had been since
Thanksgiving of last year, so my endurance was low.  But I still had fun.</p>

<p>I started from my apartment, skating down the street to where it's all under
construction.  Watching traffic patterns carefully, calculating trajectories
and the reactions of drivers, I rolled smoothly between the barrels and 
between the cars, then accelerated toward oncoming traffic in a blocked-off
section of street.  I slowed a bit to let the last of a wave of cars veer left
out of my way, then shot out into the street pushing hard toward the next 
intersection which held back the next wave of cars.  I did not quite make it
to the gap in the median before they came, so I had to squeeze myself between
the oncoming cars and the curb for just a *second* before I reached the
opening in the median for me to cross the street.  Looking behind me I noted
the cars had just been let across the intersection from which I just came.
I pushed harder and made my right turn at the second intersection before they
reached me.  Success.</p>

<p>I relatively leisurely skated down Dallas Street, catching my breath, and
wondering if Allen Parkway would be blocked off yet for the street festival to
be held there the next day.   I reached Taft and turned left toward Allen 
Parkway.</p>

<p>The hill leading down to Allen Parkway on Taft is a pretty fun one to skate.
Taft goes down the hill, stopping at Allen Parkway to form a T intersection.
The traffic going from right to left on Allen Parkway never has to stop at this
intersection, so even if you time the light correctly, there still is traffic 
to navigate.</p>

<p>This time, I start at the top of the hill, push push push push push push down
down faster faster faster, watching the light for cross traffic turn yellow
then red, and then green light for me (yay!) as I fly into the intersection, 
up onto the median for an instant before I cross the nonstop flow of traffic 
and see there's only one car and plenty of room so I fly off the curb, cross 
the street (watch the light post) up the curb, cut my turn harder to keep 
from tumbling over the guard rail into the ravine.  Made it.  
Perfect.</p>

<p>Skated slowly up the sidewalk/trail along Allen Parkway till I reached downtown
Houston.</p>

<p>Turned left on some street, went a ways then left on another street which I
knew would take me down toward the other side of Allen Parkway.  The light was
holding back the cars that wanted to use my same hill, so I glanced at their
headlights as if to say, "excuse me; I'll just be a second," and took off down
the hill before them.  There is no tricky intersection at the bottom, and the
light god held the cars back for more than necessary, so I easily was off the
street and headed back up the hill before the cars even got to the bottom.</p>

<p>Up through what we call Coyote Park, I skated to the top of the hill and lay 
down beneath the bronze coyote which is pictured on the front of the Houston
A-L Yellow Pages phone directory (good till September 1997) and rested.</p>

<p>Skated twice down the hill at Jones Plaza, once with some traffic, and once
without, but it wasn't nearly as good as some of my previous adrenaline trips
down that hill (see 
<a href=/skate/skate20.html>Wild Skating Adventure Twenty</a>
for a brief description).</p>

<p>Skated around a bit, but I didn't really see any other skaters.
I went up to the University of Houston Downtown campus, to skate down one of 
my favorite hills in Houston.  At the top, I skated inside the campus building
for a while, got something to drink, talked to a few students.  I even found
a night club/bar kinda place where there were two guys doing a stand up comedy
routine.  Cool!</p>

<p>I tried flirting with the girl selling tickets to get in free, but she resisted
pretty well.  The manager came up and said I would have to take my skates off
to come inside anyway, so I left.</p>

<p>Back outside to the top of the hill, I waited for the light to turn
red at the bottom.  I counted 10 seconds (while some cars went by
before me) and then took off toward the bottom.  Push push push push
avoid the groove-of-death (<a href=/skate/skate10.html>Wild Skating
Adventure Ten</a>), light turns green, fly through the intersection
yahoooo what a rush!</p>

<p>Slowly skated around the block and back to UH Downtown and called Wende, my 
girlfriend, who I knew was working there in the bookstore.  I ate M&amp;Ms, read
<i>Beavis and Butt-Head do Hollywood</i>, and then we went home.</p>
