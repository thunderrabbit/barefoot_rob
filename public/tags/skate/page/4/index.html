<h1>Merry Christmas!</h1>

<p>This is actually my latest skating adventure, from which I just
returned and am still feeling the effects.  I went to Southside Skate
Park (I think that's what it's called) and for the first time I skated
some half pipes and vert ramps.  This is also the first time I've done
any ramp skating since my accident over a year ago.</p>

<p>They opened at 11pm and a bunch of people were already waiting.
There was only one, maybe two people older than me.  Her name is Laura
(that makes like 18 for those who are keeping track) and the guy who
might be older is Ed, the best best all-around skater in Houston.</p>

<p>It was Laura's first time to skate off her neighborhood sidewalks; I was
impressed with her guts.  She and I went first to the smaller half pipe and
just stood there watching the guys skate it.  Most of them were about
14 to 18 years old, and there were two 10-year-olds who were pretty skilled
on the ramps.</p>

<p>So we watched and then were like, "hey, if they can do it, then we,
both being gymnasts, can certainly do it."  So we rolled down many
times and with lots of repetition we both got to the point where we
could skate down one side and up the other side to standing.  Cool.
<br>I am realizing my story has no real thrills to describe except
personal growth through practice and many bruises.  I busted both
elbows (need to get elbow pads) and my right hip and both shins.  But
by the end of the night, I was able to skate down the much bigger half
pipe and do a couple of passes on it.  Pretty cool.</p>

<p>The moral is practice practice practice and you can do whatever you
want.</p>

<p>Have fantastic holidays.</p>

<p><p>Much Love
<br>- Rob<p></p>

                        <p class=date>24 November 1995<p>

<p>Wednesday night I went skating downtown to check out all the floats
for the Thanksgiving day parade.  I parked at Fuzzy's and put my
skates on.  Didn't see anyone out.  I skated to Party on the Plaza
area and there were a couple of skateboard dudes on skateboards
goofing around and a couple of security guards guarding a lot of empty
chairs.  I talked to one of them and was like, "where's the floats?"
He said they were not out yet; that this year they had them in a
warehouse until the parade started.  Hmmmm.  Sounded kinda weird to
me; I didn't know of any warehouses close enough or big enough to hold
floats until the parade..  maybe they're in the Collesium.</p>

<p>I skated to UH Downtown and muscled my way up the hill past a wrecker
with a cop car behind it.  They both had their lights on, but there was
no car being towed..  Was the cop car being towed?  Was the wrecker being
ticketted?  Probably the latter, if either, because they both drove away
as I came back out of the building.</p>

<p>It's fun inside UHD.  Smooooth linoleum floors and lamp posts in the middle
of the hallway.  Usually very few or no people in there at that time of
night.  There were two college age (what does that mean?) women on a bench
that maybe commented or maybe it was my ego as I skated by.  I didn't go
to my usual water fountain; there was a guy mopping in there.  Didn't want
to piss him off, plus water is really bad for skates.  Especially on
linoleum.</p>

<p>The cop car and wrecker were pulling away as I came out.  I was
glad, because I didn't know how the cop would react to me whizzing
past him in a few seconds.  The light at the bottom turned red, my cue
to count 10 seconds, although I found that 8 works just as well.
"six, seven, eight, go! go! go!" and I pushed as *fast* as I could
down the hill.  Stroke stroke stroke faster faster faster, light turns
green, avoid the line-of-death, push push push, tuck!  Sail through
the intersection, actually passing the car which was at the bottom
waiting for the light.  I *love* that.  I love it.  Stay tucked until
the speed drops somewhat and then push push push up to Franklin and
turn right back toward the Brewery Tap.</p>

<p>The line-of-death, which in this case I jumped over to avoid, will stop 
an inline skate in an instant if one hits it.  The wheels just get
stuck in that little trench and you're toast.  I've done it.  I have 
a scar from a big strawberry on my butt/hip to prove it.</p>

<p>I skated into the Tap, but there were no skaters in there that I 
recognized, and the ones I saw were being all private so I didn't talk
to them.</p>

<p>I skated back toward the Plaza and now there were two security
guards and (finally!) some skaters that I could talk to.  I knew I
could talk with them because they were all sitting in the middle of
the street laughing as one guy lay on his back with his hands and
skates up in the air.  Roadkill, I presume.  I sat down with them and
we talked and they asked how long I had been skating and they found
that yes, *I* was the guy who busted his head open at Jones Hall a
little over a year ago.</p>

<p>I asked if I could join them skating tonight and Jim said yes, if I
could keep up with them.  I smiled, "I can keep up with you," hoping
that I would find that to be a challenge.</p>

<p>I looked up the street and saw the silhouette of a giant turkey.
"The floats!" I announced and we all agreed to go see them.  I skated
up there and Nancy was close behind me.  The three guys trailed way
behind us.  No challenge.  Oh well.  We checked out the floats and
talked to the guards who were making sure we didn't steal them.</p>

<p>I noticed we were right by Luther's garage, but they didn't want to
skate it.  I said well, we can skate down Allen Center or Jesus Saves.
Nancy thought that sounded pretty interesting, so we skated to the
church after which Jesus Saves is named.</p>

<p>"That's Allen Center and that's Jesus Saves.  Allen Center is
pretty nice.  You can see how Jesus Saves goes down two levels at a
time.  It's pretty tough."  Nancy and Jim wanted to skate down Allen
Center so I led them to the elevators and we went up.  Keith didn't
want to go.  We skated past the camera and up the elevator and up the
stairs and to the roof of Allen Center.  I showed them where they had
painted a giant Houston Rockets logo on the roof about 60 feet in
diameter.  The only proof was squiggly scars from sandblasting it
off.</p>

<p>We skated up there for a while and then I told them what to look
out for on the way down.  I described the posts that designate where
pedestrians can walk without worrying about cars.  (Apparently they
have to worry about skaters though.)  "Don't hit the posts.  They are
quite securely fastened."</p>

<p>We skated down the thing pretty slowly and I told them about the
chain that forces a tight turn at the bottom.  Halfway down, someone
shouted "security!" so we scooted over across to the "other" ramp
forcing the security truck to go all the way down and back up or all
the way up and back down before he could get to us.  Heh.  They skated
out, and I took one quick skate down to the almost half pipe shaped
concrete at the bottom.  Have to do that when I do Allen Center.</p>

<p>Keith was pretty entertained at how we avoided security.</p>

<p>We skated to the garage where I have *never* seen security and did
that one.  I don't know what it's called, and it's pretty tame, so I
think that must be why security is never there.  I skated it once with
my group sans Keith and when we got to the bottom, a different group
of skaters went into the garage so I skated down with them.  Heath and
Tex were two of their names.  Apparently I had met them before.  Half
of their group stayed on top to smoke a joint.  I was all "see ya!"
and I raced Tex down the garage.  He and I were about evenly paced all
the way down, but I noted he only liked to turn left.  I passed him
when it came time to do a right hand turn.</p>

<p>As we zipped past "my" group at the bottom, they said jokingly that
we passed the test, that we were allowed to skate with them.  They
were ready to go home, so I skated with them back to their vehicle,
which happened to be parked near Luther's.  We exchanged numbers and
promised to call each other.</p>

<p>Two guys had just skated into Luther's so I said bye to my group
and joined the two guys at the top of Luther's.  We skated down the
thing pretty fast but had to be really careful at the third level
because it was all soaking wet.  They went back up the elevator and I
skated out past the gaurd booth.</p>

<p>Skated back to the Plaza and found some guys skating toward the
Tap.  so I joined them and it turns out that one of them recognized me
from UH when I coordinated Recycling Day two years ago.  Wow.  We
skated down the UH Downtown hill and then to the Houston Chronicle
area where there is a flat wall that is short on one end and tall on
the other due to the fact that the sidewalk sinks below it.  I
suggested to a guy who was skating toward the end that he didn't jump
off it unless he had before.  He hadn't, so he didn't.  The security
guard came out of that building as he normally does, so we skated off
the premises.  Tex and Heath skated up.</p>

<p>They were going to skate a garage I had never skated before so I joined
them.  I don't know what it's called, but it is 10 stories tall and 
entirely enclosed down at the end of Milam.  It's pretty cool.  We
skated down it twice.   I skated back to where I had left the other
group, but they were gone.</p>

<p>Skated back to the Plaza, but no one was there.  Skated back to
Fuzzy's by way of the YMCA to get some water.  I got to my car and it
was like 2am.  Time to go home.</p>

<p>See ya

                        <p class=date>Friday 20 January 1995<p>

<p>Last night was my latest wild skating adventure.  I skated from my
house to Party on the Plaza and met Chris and about 5 of his friends
there.  We goofed around up there playing disc with my
glow-in-the-dark Boneheadz disc.  Then we went to The Texas Club,
which is one of my favorite garages in the downtown area.  It's like
12 or 13 stories tall, and it's *entirely* enclosed by windows, so it
stays comfortable and clean in there all the time.  On the way up the
ramp to the elevators, a van was its way down, pretty much taking up
the whole lane, but we managed to sqeeze by to the elevators.  We got
to the top and skated down the whole thing without incident, except
that two of the guys fell near the last turn at the bottom.  The last
turn is both steeper and sharper than any of the others in the garage,
so it's a bit of a doozy if you're going too fast.</p>

<p>We stopped by the Houston Chronicle newspaper printing press
viewing windows on the way to Brewery Tap for water.  We went next
door to Power Tools, but they wouldn't open for another 35 minutes.
So we cruised to the parking lot at Main street and Franklin, which I
have decided is my favorite street level parking lot in downtown.  We
played disc there for a while then we went up the hill on Main street
to the U of H Downtown campus.</p>

<p>Okay, when you get to the top of the hill look down the hill at the
traffic light at the bottom.  When it turns red, count off 8 or 9
seconds and then skate skate skate skate as fast as you can toward the
bottom.  The light will turn green, and you'll go flying through the
intersection on the green light.  If you do it fast enough, you will
literally pass the cars at the bottom that are getting started through
the intersection.</p>

<p>Note: there is a groove in the right hand lane of the hill that
runs parallel to us flying down the hill.  The groove is precisely the
right size for inline skate wheels to get stuck in it.  My right skate
got stuck.  Bad.  Fortunately, most of my impact was taken up by my
right kneepad.  Then the pad slid down my leg and my knee caught some
concrete.  I was holding my frisbee with my right hand, and I fell
forward onto my wrist guard and frisbee.  Then my hip hit the ground
and I slid there for a moment.  Wow.</p>

<p>I yelled to the others, "Keep going!  Keep going!"  I didn't want
them to miss the light and get into an interesting situation with
traffic.  I got up and hobble-rolled down the hill, across the street,
and met up with them in a small parking area.  My kneepad had a
*large* clean white spot where it took most of the blow.  My frisbee
had a large scrape across the face.  My hip had a deep
strawberry/scrape about 5 inches in diameter.  My shorts got a nice
rip in them, too.  Thriving on the adrenaline rush, I yelled, "I'm
doing it again!!!"</p>

<p>Chris went up the hill with me.  We counted off the 9 seconds and
then skated like crazy all the way down, this time in the left lane.
I passed a car going through the intersection at the bottom.
Yes!!</p>

<p>We cruised to Power Tools where skaters get in free.  It was really
uncrowded.  A girl was all smiley dancing by herself in there, acting
stoned on something- I don't want to know what.</p>

<p>We skated to a well-staired area by Alley Theater.  One guy skated
down all the steps- like 5 sets of 10 or 12 steps each.  It's actually
somewhat trickier than just 50 or 60 steps; you've got to adjust for
the level sections between the steps.  I was impressed at how well he
did it.  I made it down like 4 of the 5, but nowhere near as smoothly
as he did.</p>

<p>We cruised to Allen Center and hopped in the elevator to level 6.
The elevator doors opened and there was a guard standing there waiting
for us right in front of the doors.  He shooed us out of the building.
So we skated across the street and blatantly into Jesus Saves.  This
garage got its name from the gaudy neon sign at the top of an old
church across the street.  The name fits.  If you skate down the
garage without wrecking at least once, wow.  We skated right past the
guard booth; I didn't see if the guard noticed us.  While we waited
for the elevator, I expected the little speaker in the wall to tell us
to leave.  It didn't.</p>

<p>Up to the 13th floor we went.  I was the only one in the group who
had skated Jesus Saves before, so I told them about it.  "Each ramp
goes steeply down two levels.  There is a 180 degree turn at the
bottom of each ramp to get to the next ramp.  If you need to dump
speed, just turn 90 degrees and dump speed in the parking area.  Note
that the ramps are rough, but the turns are not, so it's very easy to
slide on the turns."</p>

<p>Chris and I went flying down the whole garage together.  I fell
once; he didn't fall at all.  Wow.  We got to the bottom and waited a
full minute before the next guy got down the garage.  The next guy to
arrive came from the direction of the elevator.  He had used it from
level 7.  The other two guys took longer.</p>

<p>We skated to Fuzzy's and did the Kellogg Garage.  In the elevator
between the second and third floor, the elevator suddenly stopped and
an alarm went off.  Crap.  We were caught.  We were there for fully 8
or 10 seconds before someone (not me) realized he had hit the "push to
stop pull to run" button.  Whew.  We skated the garage without
incident; it's rather tame compared to Jesus Saves.</p>

<p>After that, Chris, et. al. left.  I went into Fuzzy's and talked to
some people.  I met Tom, who had called 911 after my accident on 15
September.  He told me that as he dialed he was thinking, "I'm wasting
my time.  He's gone."  Wow.</p>

<p>After that, I skated about 5 miles before I took a shower.  My road 
rashes hurt like hell.    I can't wait to go out and skate again.</p>

<p>See ya

<p>Wow.  Tonight was my latest wild cool skating adventure.  I skated
to Kirsten & Scott's apartment and Roberta and Mike were there and we
all skated to downtown (about 2 miles).  We skated the Blueprint
Garage first.  I think it should be called 777, because that address
is more prominent than the name of "Blueprint," a store-type thing at
the bottom.  The garage is 12 stories tall.  At the top, the perimeter
has 3 cables to act as a fence- nothing too sturdy whatsoever, so I
skate carefully when I'm by the edge.
<br> We spit off the building a couple of times (I'm glad no one had
to pee), then we skated down.  We stopped at level 2; the guard was in
the booth at the bottom, so we hopped on the elevator to go back up.
The elevator door opened, and a guy was in there... whenever we're
waiting for an elevator, and someone is in it when the doors open,
there is always that split-second when we go, "eeep" wondering if
we're busted.  We weren't.  Instead, he asked incredulously, "are you
going to skate all the way down?"  Mike joked, "no, we're going to
walk, he's going to skate," pointing to me.  Scott said, "it's like
skiing for free."  "This is the lift," I said as the doors opened,
"and there's the hill."</p>
 

<p>He got off on floor 10; we went up to 12.  We zipped by him on
level 10; he hadn't even gotten into his car yet.  On the way down,
Scott said, "if the guard is awake, we can use the elevator to get out
of the building.  If he's sleepin', we can just cruise on by."  The
guard was awake, but we zoomed past his booth right in front of his
face.  I crouched down under the parking garage arm thing at probably
15 miles per hour.  That is so fun.</p>

<p>We cruised to Party on the Plaza, where the trees still had white
Christmas lights all wrapped around them.  It made the top of the
Plaza look like a frozen lake turned skating rink.  Beautiful.  We
played disc up there; I skinned my right forearm and shin.  We met
Rodney and Doug. It was Doug's first night and I crashed into him
twice.  I guess I shouldn't have come skating toward him at a 90
degree angle so fast.</p>
 

<p>We cruised to Brewery Tap for a pitcher of water.  The guy kinda
complained about us never paying for anything, so Roberta gave him
three bucks tip.  Then we went next door to Power Tools, where skaters
get in free every night!  I love it.  There was no one
dancing. Instead they had a weird action-oriented home video looking
thing playing on the big-screen TV.  We watched it a bit while we
rested and then we left.</p>

<p>We watched some skateboard dudes at the Plaza.  They were jumping
over a sideways trashcan.  I've never quite figured out how they do
that.  I mean, the board isn't attached to their feet!!  Crazy.</p>
 

<p>We went to Allen Center and played disc up there for a good 30
minutes.  I looked out over the edge of the building at the cars
scurrying along I-45, and I began to imagine what my life will be like
in 10 years from now.......will I still be skating, or will I just
have to remember this view forever?
<br>We skated and skated and skated all over the top of the garage and
then went down the thing.  No sweat smooth all the way down (I need to
find a biggertallerscarier garage) and then -shit- at the very bottom
where there's like a half-pipe shaped thing there was water at the
bottom.  Crap.  So I jumped over the water and landed on the 45 degree
slant of the pipe and kinda wrecked almost not too bad of a wreck at
the top.  I stopped for a second and then skated down and jumped off
the slant across like 4 or 5 feet of water.</p>
 

<p>Kirsten, Scott and Mike were tired, and went home.  Roberta and I
skated to Cafe' Brazil, which is probably 5 miles from Brewery Tap,
and she told me her version of my skating accident (four months less
two days ago).  I am so glad to be back on skates.</p>

<p>See ya

<p><p>Since my accident, I have had an exceptional recovery.  I only have
a little bit of tense muscle type problem in my back.  I almost have
my entire sense of smell back.  I am ready to <em>skate</em>.  I went looking
for a helmet, but was unable to find one that seemed quite tough
enough for me.  One weird thing was that when I described my accident
to some guys at a bike shop, they were like, &ldquo;oh, <em>you&rsquo;re</em> the one!
Wow.  You&rsquo;re the man..&rdquo; Heh- I don&rsquo;t know if I want fame if it takes
such an accident.  So I&rsquo;m quite ready to skate. I know I will before
the year comes to an end. Well, I <em>hope</em> I will. I need to get that
super cool helmet first.<p></p>

<p>Instead of a wild and crazy skating adventure, I will describe
(briefly) the latest news on my recovery.  My head has stopped
hurting, my ear has stopped ringing, and I might have the tiniest bit
of my sense of smell back.  However, my back is still really hurt.  I
went to my chiropractor and she popped my back.  (they call it
"aligning."  I call it pain.)  But, in fact, after the pain, my back
did actually feel a little bit better.  A little bit.  I talked to her
(the doctor) at some length and she told me the following wonderful
news.  I will have a complete complete recovery.  I will be able to
play frisbee again.  I'll be able to skate again, and I'll be able to
do gymnastics again.  I was so very entirely pleased when she told me
that.  However, unfortunately, she estimated complete recovery will
take between 9 months to 2 years.  Sigh.  But I am highly pleased that
I will be better again.  So that's it.  Hopefully from here it's just
a continual, although slow, process to recovery.</p>

<p>Well, as you may have heard, my latest Amazing Skating Adventure
wasn't as wonderful as some of the others I've had.  On Thursday (the
15th) I went downtown to Jone's Plaza area and found my friends
watching some skaters jump 2 different ramps while *hundreds* of other
skaters watched.</p>

<p>Wow.  One of the ramps had 3 boxes stacked behind it- I'm guessing
about 9 feet high.  Eric, who built that particular ramp, was jumping
the boxes consistently, smoothly, beautifuly, capturing the attention
of all the hundreds of skaters.  It was amazing.  He'd come whizzing
down the sidewalk [zziiing], shoot up the ramp [shoop], tuck and sail
above the boxes [air], then land flawlessly beyond them [smooth].

<br>I was entirely impressed.
<br>[zziiing] [shoop]  [air] [smooth]
<br>I was really entirely impressed.  I watched how perfectly easily he did it.
<br>[zziiing] [shoop] [air] [smooth]
<br>"MAN, I wish I could do that!!"  I was excited.
<br>[zziiing] [shoop] [air] [smooth] (perfect.)
<br>"I bet I could do that!!"
<br>[zziiing] [shoop] [air] [smooth]
<br>(someone took a picture of him tucked in midair.)
<br>"I *know* I can do that!!"</p>

<p>I was going to jump.  Eric was stopped near me.  He was *right*
*there* and I almost asked him for his helmet.  He was talking to
someone; I didn't want to interrupt.  "Aw fuckit" I thought.  "What
could happen?"</p>

<p>I skated up the sidewalk so that I could get some speed down toward the ramp.
The boxes had just gotten knocked over by someone.  I remember waiting for
them to get stacked back up again.
<br>That is all I remember.</p>

<p>Apparently, I came hauling ass down toward the ramp, hoping that
speed would make up for lack of skill and finesse.  It didn't.  I hit
the ramp and went up.  Way up.  My feet went higher.  I *almost*
cleared all the boxes.  I hit the top of the top box and then fell,
nearly head first, and landed splat on my upper back and shoulders,
and cracked my head on the sidewalk.
<br>Bad bad bad bad bad.</p>

<p>I sat up... and clunked right back down again, cracking skull
against concrete.  My body began to spasm as I curled into fetal
position.  My friend Scott passed out.  I'm sure a lot of people
wanted to pass out: everyone thought I was dead.  A few people
approached me, searching for a pulse, but to no avail.  (Kudos to
Randy who held my head to keep me from smashing it on the ground as I
shook.  I don't know who the other people were who helped, but I thank
them.)</p>

<p>There was blood.  A lot of it.  It apparently squirted out my right
ear just like in the movies but worse.  Fortunately, since the place
was so packed, an ambulance was close at hand and I was ace number one
priority in the ER.</p>

<p>Eight or twelve hours later I began to vaguely realize through
cloudy brain waves that I was in a hospital.  My entire existance was
pure pain.  While slipping slowly in and out of consicousness for
hours or minutes I don't know which but I hurt and I had to vomit.  So
I did.  God, it hurt.</p>

<p>I remember ripping the IV tube out of my arm because I hurt.  I was
in no shape to argue when the nurse put it back.  NG tubes suck.
Catheters suck worse.</p>

<p>I was pretty messed up.  Lots of friends and my immediate family
came to see me; I just hurt, suffering through consciousness.  It was
not until 36 hours later that I could actually recognize my friends
and family.  I had been moved out of intensive care and into a ward
room.</p>

<p>I wanted out of the hospital.  By Monday afternoon, I was able to
shuffle (with a person on each arm) my way around the nurses' station,
a whole 100 feet or so.  I begged for them to let me out.  They did.
<br>My back hurt like hell and if I moved, it hurt worse.  
<br>I had a monster headache for over a week.  My right ear was
ringing for six weeks.  My back hurt for nine months.  My sense of
smell is still not entirely back.  
<br>I had fractured my skull, fractured my TMJ, received a double
concussion, and chipped one of my vertebra.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I didn't skate for ten months.  I will be the first to tell you
that I am lucky to be alive, much less walking, much much less
skating.</p>

<p><p>Wear a helmet, and be careful when you skate.<p></p>

                        <p class=date>Friday 1 July 1994<p>

<p>Skating last night started out lame, but ended with wild new
adventures for me.  I hung out at Party on the Plaza with Karen who
only remembered me after I reminded her that she was the first person
I talked to after I sliced my thumb and smeared blood all over my NO
FEAR T-shirt.  I was wearing the shirt last night, as I always like to
when I skate.</p>

<p>From the Plaza, I joined a group skating to Fuzzy's, a bar that
has lots of police department type stuff- badges, lights, pictures,
and even a banged up HPD vehicle door.  No one was doing anything 
there, so I joined a group that was skating to a bar called Heads Up.
The name of the bar was unfamiliar to me until I remembered that it
is right in the middle of the gay bar part of Houston, near where I 
live.  Dude- I was kinda wary of going in there, but with all of us
together, I felt better.  There was probably about 20 of us clompering
up the steps into the bar.  There were about 4 or 5 people already in 
the bar, so safety in numbers really worked for me.  We hung out and
I talked to Susanah, who it turns out that I met her on 4th of July
last year, which was the first day she had ever skated.  That was
kinda cool.  While we were there, someone sang over the intercom,</p>

<pre>
 I hate you
 you hate me
 I shot Barney in the knee
 with a thump he fell to the floor
 no more purple dinosaur.
</pre>

<p>We cheered.  About 15 minutes later, someone shouted, "Let's Skate!!"
Within 1 minute the bar was empty except for the original 4 or 5 
people still there.</p>

<p>I skated with a group of 6 people back downtown to Fuzzy's.  Ed,
who is *really* good on skates was there, and he had skinned his
elbow.  He said that he was trying to do 180s (180 degree turns in the
air) over a box they had set up by a ramp, and he toasted twice in a
row.  I had him wipe some blood on my shirt.  A ramp at the Plaza, eh?
So we skated to the Plaza and Adam had his new ramp out there and
everyone was jumping it or watching.  One guy could get about 5 feet
of air off the ramp- that was wild.  The ramp was about 1.5 feet high
and 3 feet long.  I scoped out the situation, and didn't feel too
happy about the box being there, so they laid it on its side and I
jumped it that way.  No sweat actually.  I jumped it about 5 or 7
times and only needed my pads once.  I did good pads, so that was
cool.  "Good pads" means one used his/her pads well during a wreck.  A
cool thing was that there was actually a female jumping with us.  I
had not met any women who would do ramps with us.  Her name is Sonja.
Adam put the ramp away and 5 of us bunched together and skated in
search of water.  We went to Brewery Tap and drank two pitchers of
water in about as many minutes.  We cruised to go do some parking
garages.  At this point, we had 9 people in our group.  Roberta
brought a new kind of frisbee called a Woblong, which I had never seen
before.  It throws really weird compared to regular frisbees.  We were
crazy skating down the street chasing after the disc all around cars
and buses trying to drive.  One time, I threw the thing and it veered
left and I chased it up onto the sidewalk and I ended up sitting on
the sidewalk with my back against the building.  Roberta came flying
by along the sidewalk and I scrunched my leg up just in time to get it
out of her way.  We had big fun Woblonging all the way to Allen Center
parking garage.  We rode to the top of the elevator and then clanged
up the stairs to the seventh level, the very roof of the building.
There we had a 150 X 150 foot playing area, nice and smooth, with no
cars and a four foot wall all around the perimeter, except at the ramp
to drive/skate down.</p>

<p>We threw the Woblong around, performing the graceful chaotic dance
that I never can describe except that its pretty much random as we
skate to get the disc while barely avoiding each other..  The pattern
would be quite an interesting one to see from the air.  I learned how
to throw that thing while we were up there.  At one point Matt and I
both committed ourselves to recovering the Woblong where it lay, and
we both knew the other was coming at a right angle, but we both didn't
veer off course.  BLAM!!!  we smashed into each other and bounced all
over the place.  Neither of us snagged the disc.  We got up and
verified that the other was okay, and I shouted to everyone else,
"dude!  Wasn't that cool?  How did that look?" and one guy said, "it
looked like you both ate it."  Heh.  We skated up there for probably
30 minutes and the we chilled by the wall before skating down.  Once
again, I found the garage to be not as wild as the first time I skated
it, so I made it harder by swerving in and out of various obstacles
and such.  At the very bottom is a weird part of the garage that is
almost like a 1/2 pipe built just for us.  We skated it a few times
and I was able to scrunch right up near the very top of it where the
ramp was only 4 feet below the ceiling.  That was cool.
<br>On the way out of the garage, I successfully accepted a
challenge to jump over a chain about two feet high and land on the
ground on the other side about 4 feet below the chain.  The ceiling
above the chain was only about 5 feet higher than the chain.  They all
clapped politely impressed after I did it.</p>

<p>Then we went to George R. Brown Convention Center to do the
18-wheeler access ramps.  This time we skated on the *other* ramp than
the one I did last time.  This ramp does not lead straight into a
street where you barely have to turn to exit, but forces one to make a
tight right turn within the width of the street that it dumps onto,
which is about 4 or 5 lanes wide.  We hiked to the top and the first
time down, I raced one of the guys.  Last time I did the other ramp, I
just coasted down and that was lame.  This time, we both pushed down
pretty much as fast as we could.  As I was about half-way down, I
thought, "no way.  No way I can make it."  So I braked hard and must
have braked while skating 60 feet or so before I got off my brake and
made the turn at the bottom.  He won by about 20 feet.  We coasted 2
blocks and then turned around to skate it again.  The hike to the top
was definitely higher this time.  He didn't want to race, so I went
first and really hauled-ass all the way down.  No braking for me at
all.  I was flying down and had to use the entire width of both the
ramp and the street to make my turning radius as wide as possible.  As
I entered the street, I noted that 4 of the people in our group were
sitting on the curb with skates in the street.  "Oh shit!" I yelled
and cranked my turn harder and <barely made the turn and whizzed past
them.  I had to use my brake to keep from coasting more than 3 blocks
this time.  I was really moving.</p>

<p>We skated back toward the Plaza and our group slowly broke up as we
reached our respective vehicles.  I gave them my phone number, and I
really think we might skate together again sometime.</p>

                        <p class=date>14 June 1994<p>

<p>About a week ago was my latest crazy skating adventure.
<br>My goal for the night was to skate down the 18-wheeler access ramps at
the George R. Brown Convention Center on the edge of downtown.  At
Party on the Plaza, I talked to a guy named Matt, I think, told him my
goal, and he and I skated over there. The access ramps are about 3
stories tall and pretty darn long.  They actually span a city block
away from the building on each side. Before we went up, we planned our
exit route that we would take as we finished the ramp.  There was a
bit of street construction there, so we said "okay we'll skate
between these two barrels and if there is no car, we can skate out
into the street, otherwise we need to jump over this piece of wood
blah blah.." We got that planned, so we skated up one of them, and got
scared 3 times as 3 cars came down and each time I *knew* it was a
police car and we were busted. Fortunately, I was wrong.       We got
to the top and looked over the edge.  When we would spit over the
edge, it took like 4 or 5 seconds to splat on the ground.  We were way
up there.   "Ready?"   "Let's go."  I went first.  I got going pretty
fast, got to the bottom of the ramp, skated between the barrels, out
into the street because there was no traffic, coasted 2 blocks and
that was it.  That was it??  I wanted *speed*, white knuckle blinding
*speed* that would rocket us across the city.  It just didn't happen
When I go next time, I'll push myself so I get more speed than just
gravity pulling me down.</p>

<p>I found a group that plays disc in a bank drive-through area, so I
joined them for a while.  ("Disc" is the word we use for the game that
normal people call "frisbee."    Frisbee is actually a brand name.) So
this drive through is like really really smooth concrete, and well
lit, so we have big fun there.  I was unable to play as much as I
wanted; I felt really tired the whole time, like I was doing a lot of
work, but just not going anywhere.  I made a few cool catches, though:
a through-the-legs catch and one big leaping catch that almost made me
eat concrete. After playing disc, I saw two women I talked to when I
went jousting and they were with 3 other people. They were about to go
skate some parking garages, so I joined them. We got to one and found
that the building had just recently installed garage door style gates
that would not permit us to skate in like we usually do- just skate
under the little parking garage arm thing. So that effectively kept us
out.  So we decided to skate to Jesus Saves and see what we would find
there.   Across the street from Jesus Saves is the Allen Center
parking garage, so we skated that first.</p>

<p>Allen Center is either the first or second garage I ever skated.  I
remember it was a towering, menacing, *steep*, Garage of Terror, with
deadly posts and speed bumps everywhere.   Apparently, the owners of
the garage decided to make it nice for skaters.  The garage was not
nearly as steep, the speed bumps were much shorter, and there was much
more room between the posts.  I also noted that it was only like 4
stories tall.  It used to be 10 or 20.   As we skated out of the
garage, there was a security guard right at the bottom.  I stopped and
he said "you shouldn't be in here..skate on out of here." So we left
and went across the street to Jesus Saves. Jesus Saves is the name of
the most tremendous parking lot in dowtown Houston. (Note: the
following sentence is not a skewed perception of a beginning skater)
Jesus Saves is 13 stories tall, and each ramp goes down two stories at
a time. (The rest of the description is skewed by my opinions)  When
you skate down this sucker, you get going really *really* fast.  I
can't imagine being able to skate down it without either 1) braking on
the way down each ramp, or 2) dumping speed between each ramp by
skating on the level surface of the parking area. I chose the brake on
the way down method, and tested to see just how *little* I could brake
and still make the turn to the next ramp. Only once did I end up going
too fast and missing the turn, forcing me to dump some speed where the
cars park.  I did not hit any cars, and, as opposed to the first time
I skate Jesus Saves, I did not wreck at all on the way down.   When we
got to the bottom, I was sitting on a little wall and I felt my
wheels.   I like the fact that they get warm after flying down a
garge.  To my surprise, I found that one wheel was *hot*.   Like
"yeow!  That's hot!" hot.  It turns out that the wheel was rubbing
against part of the skate and actually melted the plastic there.  As
the plastic melted, it deformed and rubbed harder against the wheel
and removed the wheel from the axle toward the outer edge. It was
pretty wild.  That explained why I felt like I couldn't skate anywhere
when we were playing disc.</p>

<p><p>Yesterday, I went to the Montrose Skate Shop and showed him my wheel.
He was pretty impressed and scraped off the melted plastic part of the
skate.  Not even counting that one wheel, my wheels were really shot.
He said that he had just thrown away 5 sets of wheels from rental
skates that were in much better condition.  So he gave me a set of
wheels that were practically new compared to mine.   I put them on and
they work wonderfully.<p></p>

<p class=note>(above date is an educated guess)</p>

<p>Dude.</p>

<p>Last Thursday I went skating again-  my ankle was kinda messed up, but not from
skating.   I don't know what was wrong with it, but it *really* hurt by the
end of the night.</p>

<p>A guy had a small ramp set up out by Party on the Plaza.  This was super cool.
It was designed to convert all your speed into upward momentum.  :)   The 
actual ramp part of the ramp was concave, and it bowed slightly when you hit
it.   The board's bowing action, along with bending your knees slightly, 
allowed us to jump essentially straight up about 4 to 6 feet.  The first couple
of times that I tried it, I stayed cautious, and landed safely.   I tried it 
a bit faster, and went a bit higher, and ended up sliding on my wrist/palm 
pads and the toes of my skates.  (Onlookers said that I used my pads very well)
I kept it conservative again and just got the feeling of how to use the ramp
correctly.  Then I went for a big jump and *almost* ate it pretty bad.  
Luckily, I used my pads correctly again...  I jumped a few last times and my
last big jump went well.   They said I got about 5 feet of air, and I landed
properly.   Cool.</p>

<p>We also skated down a garage I had never skated before.  It's called
Biraporetti's (sp) because that is the name of the establishment at the bottom
of the building.   The garage is 13 stories tall, so it gave us a lot of time
to play on the way down.   I practiced high-speed, tight-radius turns, and 
only slid sideways once.  On one turn I *barely* squeaked past a parked truck;
My right skate went under its back bumper as I flew by.    We got to the
bottom, and I skated under the ticket booth arm thing, and then noticed that 
we were locked in the garage.  !!  The actual exit for the garage is blocked
by a steel door that opens only for cars.  So we waited for a couple minutes
until a car came down and let us out.</p>

<p>The last crazy thing I did was skate off a wall.  Okay- imagine a
building with a flat, level foundation, but with a non-level sidewalk
surrounding it.</p>

<p>So the foundation starts at one end of the block about 1 foot above the
sidewalk.  At the other end of the block, it's a bit higher.   I hopped up
onto the one foot tall side and skated along the foundation.  I figured it 
would be no problem; I had skated off this wall before.  ( I just hadn't
skated off the very *highest* point of the wall.)   So as I was approaching
the end of the wall, I got that gosh-dangit-this-is-higher-than-I-expected
feeling as I saw how high I actually was.  Now, due to the nature of how 
one lands while wearing roller blades, one doesn't have the option to stop,
reconsider, start again, then jump.   You'd be all off balance and it would
be just crazy.  Plus, there were people watching, and I was wearing my 
NO FEAR t-shirt.   So I watched as the sidewalk kept getting farther and 
farther away ...oh shit... and I got to the edge and dropped off.   
I landed straight down on my skates as I wanted to, but I got a literally
sinking feeling in my whole guts and everything and I continued to fall
forward and kinda ka-klunked onto the sidewalk.  My breath was knocked out
for a second, but I was able to get back up and continue skating.</p>

<p>I haven't gone back to see exactly how high that wall is, but it is
definitely taller than me.  My guess is that it's between 6 and 7 feet.</p>

<p>After telling this story to a few people, I have made a realization that
just because I'm wearing skates, doesn't mean that when I land, I'm 
automatically landing on pillows or anything.  There's still all that mass
smushing down on my feet and there's that momentum to ka-klunk me on the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>I took physics, and I'm finally finding an application for it.</p>
