                        <p class=date>30 May 1994</p>
<p class=note>(I am guessing at the date above.  I know it was 1994; I know it was warm; there were fireworks.  I'm guessing it was Memorial Day.)

<p>I went skating last night all over downtown Houston.  It was pretty
darn fun.   I played on Party on the Plaza and practiced skating up
and down the steps there.  One time last night I was able to jump
entirely up about 9 steps.  Some guy said, "good job," right as I did
it.  I was impressed with that.</p>

<p>I kinda joined into a group of skaters that had also been playing on
the steps and we skated about two blocks, but they were really being
slow and indecisive about where they wanted to go.  Then two guys
skated by at high speed, so I caught up with them.  We skated into
the garage we call "Luther's" (because the building into which the
garage is built has Luther's BBQ at the bottom) and up one ramp to the
elevator.  We went up to the 10th floor and then skated down down down
down down to the 5th.  Interestingly enough, the garage seemed like
really tame to me compared to the first time I skated it several
months ago.  We hopped back onto the elevator and went back up to the
10th floor.   This time we formed a chain by grabbing the person's
beltloop and skated down that way.  I was in the back, and found it
somewhat difficult to not be slung way outside of their turning
radius.  Two times I slipped off the chain, two times I was slung
outward but held on, and the other 4 times I cut the corner inside
where they skated, so I stayed right in close.  Very cool.  Then on
about level 2, we encountered two janitorial type people.  The two
guys with whom I was skating turned right and went to the elevator
again.  I skated straight down the ramp and out of the garage,
absolutely whizzing past the guard booth (there was a guard in it).
I zipped through about a 2 foot space between his booth and the
parking garage arm thing.   &lt;ffwsshheeeeeeewwwww!!>  Heh heh.  I
rocketed out into the street and cruised back to Party on the Plaza.</p>

<p>I found Carrie and Beth (who I met at 4th of July last year) skating
around the area.  I hung out with them at the Plaza just goofing
around listening to the live band and just being crazy.  There was a
security guard patrolling the sidewalk area of a particular building,
trying to catch us to tell us that we couldn't skate there.  Whenever
he would come our way, we would skate the other direction around the
entire building until we caught up with him back where we had just
been.  It was kinda silly but funny.    When the band ended, there
were bunches of fireworks, and we were like "Cool!!  Just like when we
met the first time!"   We watched them and then cruised to the Brewery
Tap to get a drink.  (I drink water)  On the way there, a small blue
pickup truck drove somewhat slowly past us and the passenger guy
yelled, "hey wassup?" or something like that.   They were right next
to me, so I latched onto the passenger side of the bed and they pulled
me about 2.5 blocks.  That was cool (and very illeagal).  While being
pulled, I worked my way along the back of the bed and then pulled
myself forward toward the driver's side so that I was actually moving
faster than the truck when I let go and turned left to meet my friends
back at the Tap.  One experiences an interesting thing when one is
pulled on skates by a vehicle.  Normal skating speed is probably about
10 miles per hour.  Top speed for me is about 15.   So the truck
pulled me at, let's say, 20 miles per hour.  Do the physics really
quickly and determine that at 20mph, I have 4 times the amount of
kinetic energy as at 10mph.  Therefore it takes a much longer time to
stop.  Very cool.  Several pedestrians saw me as I let go, couldn't
make the turning radius to stay in the street, zipped up onto the
sidewalk instead, back down into the street between two parked cars
and then into the next block through a bank drive-through area.  Only
by that time had I reached normal skating speed again.  Whew.  I made
it.  The drive-through was dark.  Just as I was about to step up about
a 1.5 foot step out of the bank area and into a parking lot, &lt;wham> I
hit a (something solid) that I didn't see at all.  I slid on my
kneepads and then jumped myself back onto my skates (somehow) and then
continued.  Just as I was tripping over the thing, a guy shouted,
"watch your step!" heh.  I recovered and shouted, "woof!  no problem."
("woof" is like "whew" but it's easier to say it louder so people can
hear you as you skate past.) I met up with Carrie and Beth at the Tap,
and I remet the two guys with whom I had skated Luther's.   I got some
water and then we went next door to a bar called Power Tools.</p>

<p>Now, Power Tools does not sound like the kind of place that I would
normally frequent.  It was all totally crowded inside so I just
followed them to the back of the bar and actually outside to what can
be best described (after my brief glance) as Power Tools' fenced-in
concrete backyard.  We walked down the outdoor steps and then under
the building again into a much less crowded concrete floored area with
realatively plenty of room to skate and dance around.   There were
blacklights everywhere, giving clothing that glow-in-the-dark look.
There were wild weird light shows playing against the walls and loud
super low bass (mostly rap) music that vibrates everything in the
room.  We hung out down there for a while and watched people and
danced around and checked out a *big* python or boa (for some reason,
"reticulated python" comes to mind) in a big cage built into the wall
down there.  I wonder how he gets along with everything vibrating like
that.  After sufficiently resting, we skated out to Fuzzy's, another
bar.  This was rather mundane compared to Power Tools.
It was about midnight and my group started splitting up, so I cruised,
skating really fast about 12 blocks to get back to my car.  I couldn't
find it at first, but then I did, and here I am.</p>

                        <p class=date>July 1993</p>

<p>I went out on a Thursday night a couple of months ago and met some
skater dudes, and we skated down parking garages, and through a tunnel
underground that connects some underground garages. We had to haul ass
through the tunnel because there was a security guard down there, and
we are *not* supposed to be there.  I was not great at going up or
down steps, but I had to learn really quickly in the tunnel.</p>

<p>I went on roller blades to the Freedom Festival out by Allen
Parkway for the 4th of July.  It was super cool.  I met about 30
skater people, many of whom are part of the Urban Animals, a skater
group in the city.  I met a girl named Beth, and she and I went people
surfing while singing the melody to the Hawaii Five-O theme song.
People surfing means whizzing through the crowds of people at high
speed and trying not to hit anyone.  We did great.  We were flying
through the crowds as I would yell, "break right!"  or "break left!"
so we would zip around to the right or left hand side of the next
people clog (for lack of a better word).  Very cool.</p>

<p>At the end of the fire works display, all 100,000 people at the
show got up and left at the same time.  That was a major traffic, bike
and people jam. Cars were too darn big to move, people with bikes
found it too crowded to ride, and pedestrians were just slow because
they aren't on wheels.  However(!), we 30 or so skater dudes were on
wheels, so we could haul butt, and we were people-sized, so we were
maneuverable. All 30 of us went racing and howling (literally) through
the crowds of cars and people and everything and everyone just parted
like the Red Sea. People in the crowd would stop to watch or howl with
us as we whizzed by.  We skated entirely across the city twice during
the night, and I was out with them until about 2am.  That was so
fantastic.</p>
