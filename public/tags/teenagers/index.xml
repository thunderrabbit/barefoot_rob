      <description>08:51 Wednesday 05 August 2015 JST I was hanging out with some teenagers I didn&amp;rsquo;t know as they were doing some dangerous experiments. A woman had a hairbrush which could deliver an electric pulse if the brush part touched somone. She touched her friend on the head with it, and he was shocked, but became addicted to it. He asked her touch him with the brush all over his face.</description>
