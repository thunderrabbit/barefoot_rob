      <description>04:49 Saturday 23 December 2017 -03 I had a schedule conflict that I detected a few days out, but didn&#39;t try to rectify until the day of the conflict. Nate wanted to have me join a late night adventure sneaking into a dark house that only I knew the layout to find some prize close to midnight. I was more interested in joining Lin to meet Travis and Yumi for a roadtrip that started at 11pm, but planned to meet in nearly the same location, an empty field next to the building that Nate and I were going to explore in the dark.</description>

      <description>22:15 Thursday 14 December 2017 JST Nate asked if I can change the icon on the new site, and gave me a whole stack of icons for different Apple devices. I was like, &amp;ldquo;false&amp;rdquo; and just changed the existing ico file.</description>
