<p><p>It has come to Jason and my attention that we won&rsquo;t be able to get the cash necessary for our big trip down under by November.</p>

<p><p>Maybe we can plan a smaller excursion, or a shorter one, or something.  But for right now, we&rsquo;ll be right here in the greater Houston area.</p>

<p><p>More later.</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s four months until my trip.  I&rsquo;ll be out of town two weeks of those four months, fortunately, all in one spot, pretty soon from now.  (end of July to 6 August)</p>

<p><p>I need about 6000 dollars for the trip.  Plus Scuba Certification.  Am I worried?  A little.  Do I have a job?  Not right now.  How&rsquo;s business?  Okay, but not crazy cashflow.</p>

<p><p>Hmmmm.  I&rsquo;d hate to take out a loan from my dad or a friend, and especially not from a credit card&hellip;   But I really really want to go.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m busy with a couple of different projects that are not currently bringing in any cash.   Smallest is KTRU, only 3 hours per week, but in the middle of Tuesday.  Then my roller coaster pictures that I&rsquo;d like to enter into some art shows.  If I focus on that (pun intended) it shouldn&rsquo;t take too long to do.  But it will cost on the order of $100.  Then my roller coaster book, but I can put that on hold essentially.  And last is youth group stuff, which will take the two weeks.  After that I can focus on work work work.</p>

<p><p>I invite the perfect job to come to me starting August 7th.</p>

<p><p>Crazy!</p>

<p><p>I just finished doing laundry and thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;  My inner voice pointed toward Kroger.  &ldquo;Go eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So I&rsquo;m sittin&rsquo; in Kroger, eating eggs and biscuits and contemplating life.</p>

<p><p>Suddenly I see Tony, one of my warrior brothers.  Recognition smiles across our faces.  &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>He&rsquo;s all, &ldquo;what are you up to?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just sittin&rsquo; in Kroger, eating eggs and biscuits and contemplating life.   In general I&rsquo;m working saving money to go to Australia in November.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m very excited about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Turns out Tony lived in Australia for 5 years, and still has contacts there who he said would be happy to give Jason and I a place to stay!!  WOW!!</p>

<p><p>Great stories he told of racing yachts and of Sydney and beaches and the whole fun lifestyle the Aussies live.  We only talked for like 10 minutes, but I gave him my card and he&rsquo;ll get me in touch with his homies.  So awesome.</p>

<p><p>Thank you Angels.</p>

<p>Yeah that never came to fruition.</p>

<p>##21 May 1999</p>

<p><p>Here is our itinerary as faxed from my travel agent. It may change, but probably will not.</p>

<p><p>Quote: Qantas Vacations</p>

<ul>
<li>Nov 5 - Depart Houston to Sydney
<li>Nov 6 - Arrive Sydney 1 night hotel reserved
<li>.
<li>Nov 10 - Depart Sydney to Ayers Rock (Qantas)
<br>3 nights at Emu Walk Apartments [eating grubs with aborigines]
<li>.
<li>Nov 13 - Depart Ayers Rock to Sydney (Qantas) 1 night hotel reserved
<li>. [ go to Gladstone (Great Barrier Reef area) ]
<li>Nov 17 - Helicopter from Gladstone to Heron Island
<li>5 nights at Heron Island Resort [lots of scuba diving]
<li>Nov 22 - Catamaran from Heron Island to Gladstone
<li>.
<li>Dec 11 - Depart Cairns to Houston
</ul>

<p><p>Price per person is $3500, unless we share a bathroom with someone at Heron Island, it&rsquo;s $3280.</p>

<p><p>Notice the big chunks of time indicated by gaps on the list.  I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll request that the [ go to Gladstone ] gap be enlarged and shrink the Nov 22 to Dec 11 gap some, unless Gladstone is a long ass way to Cairns.  Maybe we&rsquo;ll hop over to New Zealand during that time.</p>

<h2 id="may-1999-estimated">May 1999 (estimated)</h2>

<p><p>Jason called me and we began discussing plans.  He&rsquo;s been before, and wants to re-experience Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef, but this time scuba certified.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been before and want to re-experience Katoomba Falls, but this time when their roller coaster is open (Australian summer).</p>

<p><p>So we created the following plan:</p>

<table border="1">

<tr><td>get a laptop</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>collect snail addresses of people in US to write</td><td> </td></tr>

<p><p><table border="1">

<p>##17 April 1999</p>

<p><p>Jason called this morning.  He was all, &ldquo;Rob, wanna go to Australia with me for four months?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><em>whoah!</em> said my brain.  &ldquo;Whoah.  Four months?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.  My mom said that I should travel before I try to do anything else so I told her &lsquo;okay; me and Rob are going to Australia.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Wow. That would be totally great, and I can see the value in it. I totally encourage you to do it.  I just couldn&rsquo;t take that much time off.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool.  I just chose you because you&rsquo;re the only person who&rsquo;s adult enough to be able to go, but still cool enough not to have a job to keep you here.  Plus you&rsquo;re like the only person I know who I wouldn&rsquo;t want to kill after being with you for more than 2 days straight.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wow.  &ldquo;Wow. I really appreciate that.  But I just couldn&rsquo;t do it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>All day the conversation stuck in my mind. While en route to Dallas (to visit my brother and Six Flags over Texas) I had time to meditate on it.</p>

<p><p>Why not go to Australia?  I dunno.
<br>Why not go for a shorter time?  I dunno.
<br>When could you go?  After San Antonio Rally, before New Years.
<br>So that&rsquo;s all of November and December.  yup.
<br>Well?</p>

<p><p>So I called Jason from the road and left a message.  &ldquo;Yo Jason.  I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about this crazy Australia thing.  I&rsquo;ll go with you for a month, and if you want to stay longer, you certainly can.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Jason called back later and was all, &ldquo;yeah. I knew you&rsquo;d do it.&rdquo;</p>
