      <description>7 September 1999 It has come to Jason and my attention that we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to get the cash necessary for our big trip down under by November.
Maybe we can plan a smaller excursion, or a shorter one, or something. But for right now, we&amp;rsquo;ll be right here in the greater Houston area.
More later.</description>

      <description>##13 July 1999
It&amp;rsquo;s four months until my trip. I&amp;rsquo;ll be out of town two weeks of those four months, fortunately, all in one spot, pretty soon from now. (end of July to 6 August)
I need about 6000 dollars for the trip. Plus Scuba Certification. Am I worried? A little. Do I have a job? Not right now. How&amp;rsquo;s business? Okay, but not crazy cashflow.
Hmmmm. I&amp;rsquo;d hate to take out a loan from my dad or a friend, and especially not from a credit card&amp;hellip; But I really really want to go.</description>

      <description>(transcribed from my diary)
11am Sunday 24 May 1999 CST Crazy!
I just finished doing laundry and thought, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m hungry.&amp;rdquo; My inner voice pointed toward Kroger. &amp;ldquo;Go eat.&amp;rdquo;
So I&amp;rsquo;m sittin&amp;rsquo; in Kroger, eating eggs and biscuits and contemplating life.
Suddenly I see Tony, one of my warrior brothers. Recognition smiles across our faces. &amp;ldquo;Hey!&amp;rdquo;
He&amp;rsquo;s all, &amp;ldquo;what are you up to?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just sittin&amp;rsquo; in Kroger, eating eggs and biscuits and contemplating life.</description>

      <description>(14 Feb 2015, as I process old entries, I see this file didn&#39;t have a date, so I estimated)
May 1999 (estimated) Jason called me and we began discussing plans. He&amp;rsquo;s been before, and wants to re-experience Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef, but this time scuba certified.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been before and want to re-experience Katoomba Falls, but this time when their roller coaster is open (Australian summer).</description>

##17 April 1999
Jason called this morning. He was all, &amp;ldquo;Rob, wanna go to Australia with me for four months?&amp;rdquo;
whoah! said my brain. &amp;ldquo;Whoah. Four months?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah. My mom said that I should travel before I try to do anything else so I told her &amp;lsquo;okay; me and Rob are going to Australia.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Wow. That would be totally great, and I can see the value in it.</description>
