<p><em>In a large group of people in different buildings, I was flirting with a cute girl who looked liked she may be from India or Sri Lanka.   She had two friends, one of whom looked distinctly American, and I was flirting with <em>her</em> more.  The first girl noticed and blew me off in stride, and the second girl said to her girlfriend &ldquo;I think he likes me&rdquo; as she went out somewhere. </em></p>

<p>_I looked out the window as people started to gasp and point.  It looked like Niburu had arrived, though was moving rather slowly and perhaps narrowly missed the earth as it looked like it descended beyond the horizon.  I saw it hit the earth in a slow inexorable crash and it looked like one of the suns from a physics simulation I have on my phone.  It hit the planet on the other side of the horizon from my point of view, and there was a woman sitting on the chair looking a bit forlorn at the upcoming end of the world, and I said, &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; to her, but she didn&rsquo;t move, kinda of like, &ldquo;why should I stand up if the world is ending soon&rdquo; mixed with &ldquo;who are you to take my seat?&rdquo;  I yelled at her again until it was like &ldquo;Stand UP and Look out the WINDOW!&rdquo; as the object hit Earth (it was moving relatively slowly)  and the plume of smoke became visible from over the horizon and then the outward bound debris cloud creating more debris as everything collapsed in its path. _</p>

<p><em>People were screaming in the building and running like 右往左往 having no idea what to do.  I sat down on the floor and watched, keeping my back straight and eyes open, ready for the ride.</em></p>

<p><em>The smoke cloud came closer and went out of sight as it went under our building, and I could feel our building moving, perhaps lifting, then spinning a bit.  It felt good to enjoy the last few moments of life in such a tangible way.  Then it was all over.</em></p>

<p>the dream, that is haha</p>

<p><p>This is the last day of the nineteens!!!!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There's the whole debate about, "well, it's not really the millenium
or even the century cause way back in the day they started counting with
1 not 0 blahdiddyblah."

<p>Yes, I say, but realistically, what is *cool* is seeing those 000
zeros roll up onto the calendar.  I mean, driving in the car people
don't say oh look!  We just turned over 2001 miles!

<p>2000.  That's what's cool.

<p>(plus, kings and such changed the calendars arbitrarily to fit their
schedules or the schedule of the seasons or for whatever reasons they
had at various times back then.)
</blockquote>

<p><p>So anyway, this is the last of the 19s.  I mean I look back at my
ancestors and they may have been born in 1910 or 1903, but just&hellip; just
being born a few years prior and  <em>bing</em> it&rsquo;s 1800s and I think,
&ldquo;man! that&rsquo;s <b>old!</b>&ldquo;</p>

<p><p>So now <em>I</em> was born in the old century, I mean in the 19s.  Well, in
a few hours but yeah!</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>At work today I installed Win NT 4.0 into one of the three machines.
Had a little bit of frustration, but I think I got it all down now.</p>

<p><p>First problem was I couldn&rsquo;t get it to recognize the new DMA66 IDE
drive it has.  Turns out Win NT doesn&rsquo;t know about this new thing, so I
had to install the driver from a separate disk.  That only took a few
tries to figure out.</p>

<p><p>Then when I got it installed I recognized I had created &ldquo;too many&rdquo;
partitions on the hard drive.  I had created 3 partitions, which threw
off the default drive letterings for the network drives.  Tried to
reinstall the OS to fix it, but realized I just had to use Disk
Administrator.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>One down, three to go!</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Fred and I are now at Wende&rsquo;s, about to go play on his unicycle and
stuff.  Y2K downtown on skates tonight!!!!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>
