After reading on HN that Google has discontinued Blocked Sites, I was browsing through the extensions available for Chrome, and found Build With Chrome.
My creation hasn&amp;rsquo;t been approved yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s apparently visible if you click Rob&amp;rsquo;s floating v-shaped Lego thing. It looks something like this</description>

      <description>##23:11 Monday 11 March 2013
This weekend I mostly put together what I&amp;rsquo;m calling the 瞑想頑張れ meditation timer, which is a bit like referring to &amp;ldquo;ATM machines&amp;rdquo; but hey at least it&amp;rsquo;s two different languages.
It&amp;rsquo;s now available on github: 瞑想頑張れ at https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare.
There are several meditation timers on the app store, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t found one with the unique feature I wanted.
Sometimes when I meditate, I really get into it and don&amp;rsquo;t want to stop when the original time is up.</description>

      <description>##07:42 Friday 15 February 2013
I wonder wtf happened.
We are performing maintenance on the provisioning service. All provisioning requests will remain in pending status until maintenance is complete, at which time all pending requests will be automatically processed.
I took this screenshot last night at 11:22pm. It&amp;rsquo;s now 7:34am as I write this, so it&amp;rsquo;s been down for more than 8 hours.

People on ASE are wondering as well, but not as many people are wondering as who are saying it&amp;rsquo;s not a good question.</description>

      <description>##12:57 Sunday 10 February 2013
I just thought of a new idea for DrawQuest. I can&amp;rsquo;t show the full animation here, but if you have an iPad, download the app, and find me (thunderrabbit), you can see it.
I drew a snowman who then thought about killing his maker, but then the dog barked and the snowman reverted to his normal happy state.
This works easily because the eraser too erases down to the original image, not down to the blank canvas.</description>

Thanks to the incredible Sim Aquarium 3D we have an aquarium above our kitchen sink!
What an amazing world.
I can see several points where the app could be improved with future technology, but I&amp;rsquo;ve honestly never seen any computer technology so closely approach the look of a live aquarium.
My suggested future development, possibly in order of easiest to hardest:

I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get some work done; I&amp;rsquo;m trying to give my time and money to Apple so I have a chance to make a nickel.
Why is the provisioning process so obtuse? Am I just an idiot who can&amp;rsquo;t figure it out?
Why does Xcode have so many bugs? Did I write it?
As I write this, Xcode is locked up. Apparently I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to force close it.</description>

Tariq and I are creating a game of memory for iOS. This is my first project that uses blocks, and I must agree, they make coding a lot lot easier!!
This is my second big iOS project, a lot of which is based on Matthijs Hollemans&amp;rsquo; game Snap (currently without the multiplayer stuff), one of Ray Wenderlich&amp;rsquo;s excellent tutorials.
I&amp;rsquo;ve just gotten the in-game tutorial to work, though its alignment&amp;hellip; isn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to Matt&amp;rsquo;s iOS classes starting in January. He said he wants to start with &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s really going on under the surface of Xcode,&amp;rdquo; an idea I heartily agree will help me figure out wtf is going on half the time with Xcode.</description>

Not this URL, but this one: https://www.longbets.org/601/, or so the bettor suggests. I&amp;rsquo;m sure the URL will work fine, along with its friend https://longbets.org/601/ as well as future URIs in to-be-developed retrieval systems.
Anyway, I just thought the bet was interesting, so I took a couple screenshots.


I wonder if the URL for this blog entry will still work; I&amp;rsquo;ve been debating ditching Wordpress for another home built system, perhaps using an upgraded version of my old system.</description>

 Gravia is an LED-lit floorlamp energized by people. To light Gravia, the user places a mass approximately 48&amp;rdquo; above the ground, that, in falling, powers a mechanism, generating electricity. Gravia harnesses the potential energy imparted by the user, rather than relying on any existing electrical infrastructure.

 It was not clear how long ago the satellite lost power, or under what circumstances.
 Discovery News : Spy Satellite Could Crash to Earth
It&amp;rsquo;s a spy satellite!! How can they not know when it lost power? It seems more likely that someone knows quite well exactly when it lost power, but just didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything publicly.
BUT&amp;hellip;. maybe there are just so many spy satellites all on autopilot that someone didn&amp;rsquo;t notice?</description>

 Sensitive seismometers and tiltmeters to be installed in the SAFOD borehole directly above the spot that ruptures will observe for the first time the birthing process of an earthquake from the zone where the earthquake energy accumulates. Preliminary observations made in 2006 already have revealed the tiniest earthquakes ever observed—so small they have negative magnitudes.

 He has approached a number of power producers in the U.S., but has thus far been met with a yawn. &amp;ldquo;They prefer to stay with something they are comfortable with &amp;ndash; [usually] coal; whereas the Europeans and Asians have been extremely aggressive in wanting to secure control of this technology.&amp;rdquo;

 Google proposed to build an IEEE 802.11b/g Wi-Fi mesh network that delivers more than 1 megabit per second of capacity throughout the city.

 How We&amp;rsquo;ll Get Back to the Moon
 NASA - How We&amp;rsquo;ll Get Back to the Moon
This looks pretty cool. I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued by the cargo and crew launching separately, but I guess it makes sense to keep the crew away from the heavier launch thing. It will be interesting to see how they will handle disruptions in launching the second vehicle. If the first one is in orbit and then the second can&amp;rsquo;t be launched, how long can the first one stay in orbit to wait?</description>

Wow. Google Earth rules.
I am 99% certain I have found Scott, my favorite car parked at my office at FSD about 3 or 4 years ago in Houston. That is awesome.
I sent a &amp;lsquo;bookmark&amp;rsquo; to myself (and Dude and Fred); I wonder if I can post it in here somehow.</description>

Plasma pencil kills germs
This seems pretty cool. In a way, it&amp;rsquo;s like the first example of something cool that I&amp;rsquo;d never even considered possible; I thought plasma was necessarily gajillions of degrees. But now it&amp;rsquo;s available in a handheld little thing&amp;hellip; And sounds like it could become commonplace.
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, my pocketknife has a corkscrew, screw driver, plasma beam, and a knife!&amp;rdquo;</description>

automatic image categorisation
This seems pretty sweet. Google could use this technology to further optimize its image search. I could use this technology to get the pictures on my website arranged!
Amazing to imagine that we are now living in a time that computers don&amp;rsquo;t recognize what&amp;rsquo;s in photographs. Seriously.</description>

Magnetic Microchips Replaces Electronic Semiconductor
Wow. I don&amp;rsquo;t presume to know how electronic chips work, nor how magnetic chips work, but I do understand things like &amp;ldquo;smaller&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;do not generate heat&amp;rdquo;
This is super important to me as my computer gets scorching hot after just several minutes of being on unless I use an external fan.</description>

Guardian | 600 barrels of loot found on Crusoe island
Obviously the money belongs to Arturito. Finders, keepers. Too bad he&amp;rsquo;s not sentient, yet.
What would a sentient robot do with $10B?
It sounds like too much money for it to be good news, ya know? Papal rings??? Incan statues??
I seriously think it should be excavated by ARCHAEOLOGISTS, and super tight security around the whole thing.</description>

This seems to herald a day where the family physician (or anyone) can do a quick test to see if we have cancer. Totally kick ass.</description>
