<p><strong>6:44pm Sunday 24 March 2013</strong></p>

<p>After reading on HN that <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1210386">Google has discontinued Blocked Sites</a>, I was browsing through the extensions available for Chrome, and found <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/build-with-chrome/lbbbhbjeecagnlfgggogfclkdjamoapf">Build With Chrome</a>.</p>

<p>My creation hasn&rsquo;t been approved yet, but it&rsquo;s apparently visible if you click <a href="www.buildwithchrome.com/build/cFId">Rob&rsquo;s floating v-shaped Lego thing</a>.  It looks something like this</p>

                        <p>##23:11 Monday 11 March 2013</p>

<p>This weekend I mostly put together what I&rsquo;m calling the <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare">瞑想頑張れ meditation timer</a>, which is a bit like referring to &ldquo;ATM machines&rdquo; but hey at least it&rsquo;s two different languages.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s now available on github: <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare">瞑想頑張れ</a> at <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare">https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare</a>.</p>

<p>There are several meditation timers on the app store, but I hadn&rsquo;t found one with the unique feature I wanted.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I meditate, I really get into it and don&rsquo;t want to stop when the original time is up.  And I would like to know how much longer I remained in meditation.  It&rsquo;s possible to reset the timer, but that pretty much breaks the meditative state for me.</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/meiso-gambare">瞑想頑張れ meditation timer</a> counts down the predetermined time, &hellip; and then counts up until I click stop.  Simple.</p>

<p>The name comes from two words in Japanese that probably don&rsquo;t fit well together, but they work for me.  瞑想 can be transliterated as &ldquo;meiso,&rdquo; and means meditation.  頑張れ can be transliterated as &ldquo;gambare&rdquo; and means something like &ldquo;do one&rsquo;s best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, I hope it proves useful to me and others!</p>

<p>瞑想頑張れ is not yet available in the app store, but I hope to submit it within maybe a month.  Gotta get it polished a bit, plus put some icons on it.  I might strip out the FB stuff for the first version if I can&rsquo;t get it working soon.</p>

<p>I wonder wtf happened.</p>

<p><strong>We are performing maintenance on the provisioning service. All provisioning requests will remain in pending status until maintenance is complete, at which time all pending requests will be automatically processed.</strong></p>

<p>I took this screenshot last night at 11:22pm. It&rsquo;s now 7:34am as I write this, so it&rsquo;s been down for more than 8 hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/82153/for-how-long-is-apples-provisioning-service-typically-down">People on ASE are wondering as well</a>, but not as many people are wondering as who are saying it&rsquo;s not a good question.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t imagine my support suggestion will make a difference.</p>

<p>I just thought of a new idea for <a href="https://drawquest.com">DrawQuest</a>.  I can&rsquo;t show the full animation here, but if you have an iPad, download the app, and find me (thunderrabbit), you can see it.</p>

<p>I drew a snowman who then thought about killing his maker, but then the dog barked and the snowman reverted to his normal happy state.</p>

<p>This works easily because the eraser too erases down to the original image, not down to the blank canvas.</p>

<p>Thanks to the incredible <a href="https://simaquarium.com/">Sim Aquarium 3D</a> we have an aquarium above our kitchen sink!</p>

<p>What an amazing world.</p>

<p>I can see several points where the app could be improved with future technology, but I&rsquo;ve honestly never seen any computer technology so closely approach the look of a live aquarium.</p>

<p>My suggested future development, possibly in order of easiest to hardest:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>larger background so rotating the device doesn&rsquo;t force zoom-in</p></li>

<li><p>make fish out of focus when further away</p></li>

<li><p>add crustaceans</p></li>

<li><p>give fish some flaws (nibbled tails, scratches)</p></li>

<li><p>add dust particles when fish swim near the bottom</p></li>

<li><p>let the fish interact with each other (schools, chasing, fighting)</p></li>

<li><p>make the background 3D instead of just an image</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get some work done; I&rsquo;m trying to give my time and money to Apple so I have a chance to make a nickel.</p>

<p>Why is the provisioning process so obtuse?  Am I just an idiot who can&rsquo;t figure it out?</p>

<p>Why does Xcode have so many bugs?  Did I write it?</p>

<p>As I write this, Xcode is locked up.  Apparently I&rsquo;m going to have to force close it.</p>

<p>See how that little spinner isn&rsquo;t spinning in this image?  That&rsquo;s exactly how it&rsquo;s not spinning on my computer.</p>

<p>Tariq and I are creating a game of memory for iOS. This is my first project that uses blocks, and I must agree, they make coding a lot lot easier!!</p>

<p>This is my second big iOS project, a lot of which is based on <a href="https://twitter.com/mhollemans">Matthijs Hollemans</a>&rsquo; game <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/12735/how-to-make-a-simple-playing-card-game-with-multiplayer-and-bluetooth-part-1">Snap</a> (currently without the multiplayer stuff), one of <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorials">Ray Wenderlich&rsquo;s excellent tutorials</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just gotten the in-game tutorial to work, though its alignment&hellip; isn&rsquo;t. Yay for blocks and tutorials and screenshots!</p>
