      <description>22:50 Tuesday 14 August 2018 JST Four men in the circle tonight, including two relatively newcomers. I experienced beautiful facilitation to help me get the courage to implement my new idea.
I have just sent this message to my friend H.
I am thinking about doing a 6 month set of weekly circles on Friday nights. Could I do them at your place? Would you be able to attend, assuming you&#39;d be interested in the content?</description>

      <description>07:03 Wednesday 04 April 2018 JST Nice synchronicity brought two old friends together on the train just in time for one to invite the other two men&amp;rsquo;s group last night, the first Tuesday of the month, when new men are welcome to join.
Six men in the circle last night. Good strong container in which we did a lot of good work.</description>
