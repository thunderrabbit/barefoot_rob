      <description>14:09 Thursday 12 October 2017 JST Great I-group today; I had chills from within when I got to yell at my dad from when I was 7 years old.
He said &amp;ldquo;if there were 100 people from your class all in a line, you would be the smartest.&amp;rdquo;
He meant it well, but it&amp;rsquo;s like hey fuck you don&amp;rsquo;t put that on a 7 year old! what is he going to do with that info?</description>
