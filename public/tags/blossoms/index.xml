      <description>14:44 Sunday 01 April 2018 JST &amp;ldquo;Happy Easter!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not Easter!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;rdquo;?????&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;April Fools!&amp;rdquo;
Finally got back to SOGO today and it was touch! Camelia (sp) saw me and was like, &amp;ldquo;remember me??&amp;rdquo; and I was like, &amp;ldquo;I remember your face&amp;ldquo; (could be an insult, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t in this case), and she reminded me she had volunteered for Peace Boat since I last saw her. So neat to hear that it&amp;rsquo;s growing but still has the same genki energy as before.</description>
