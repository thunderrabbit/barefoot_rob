      <description>11:30 Sunday 15 April 2018 JST I found an article about setting up Fossil on Dreamhost, and may try to go through it today.
First, I will set up a new sub-domain and new user on Dreamhost.
12:07 Done. I recognize that I am using git on a server for Fossil, but am going to ignore that for now.
Though the previous article compiled from source, it appears Fossil provides Linux binaries now.</description>
