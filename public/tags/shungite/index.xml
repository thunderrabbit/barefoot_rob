      <description>18:31 Saturday 15 July 2017 JST Lin was all set to buy Shungite from Renee, but we ended up with not enough time to do so after going to Haruka lake and shrine. The lake was fine and the shrine was nice, but because we were late leaving because of this extra trip, neither Lin nor I really took the time to enjoy it. I did get a couple of pics, but nothing like wow holy shit this was worth being late.</description>

      <description>19:46 Saturday 01 July 2017 JST Wow. I had Lin hold her phone to her ear and hold out one arm. I pushed down on her arm and asked her to resist the push. I was able to apply 20 newtons before her arm sank.
Then I called her phone and did the same test. She was only able to withstand like 15 newtons.
Then I had her hold shungite next to her phone and did the same test.</description>
