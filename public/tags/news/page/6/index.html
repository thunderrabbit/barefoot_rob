<blockquote>
<p>NOVA was late paying their staff last month and that the company issued a 750 million yen corporate bond at the beginning of August, which I assumed gave it the cash to pay instructors this month (which was the 15th or 20th - could someone confirm for me?). My own estimates put their foreign staff payroll in the range of 910-1040 million yen per month, so with some cash lying around, it seems they just managed to squeak by this month.</p>

<p>##09:03 Friday 05 January 2007</p>

<p><strong>Letter from Carolyn Ho – mother of Lt Watada</strong></p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>On behalf of Lt. Watada and our family, thank you for standing with us during this most difficult time. Because of his refusal to deploy to the illegal and immoral Iraq War, my son now faces a maximum of 6 years in a military prison. The pretrial is scheduled for Jan. 4, 2007.  The court martial is calendared for Feb. 5, 2007.</p>

<p>We are just days away from the pretrial and must broaden his support base. Help us mobilize the local, national, and international community through your personal, professional, religious and other networks. Please forward the attached email alert with a brief explanation. Ask people to go to: <a href="https://www.thankyoult.org/">www.thankyoult.org</a> to learn more about Lt. Watada&rsquo;s case. On the main menu, supporters can click on SIGN PETITION/GET UPDATES AND ALERTS.  They will receive weekly email updates that call for actions in support of  Lt. Watada&rsquo;s stand.</p>

<p>Encourage your contacts to integrate these actions into the anti-war activism they are already doing.  Their voices are critical to building an international public opinion campaign that demands justice and no punishment for Lt. Watada.  His voice of resistance to this heinous war cannot be silenced!</p>

<p>In Solidarity,</p>

<p>Carolyn Ho (Lt. Watada&rsquo;s Mother)</p>

<p>****<strong>Make your 2007 New Year&rsquo;s Resolution to Stand with Lt. Watada Against Illegal and Immoral War</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, February 5, 2007 take action against the Iraq war and in support of Lt. Watada during his military court martial.  Stand up with Lt. Watada and speak out against the illegal and immoral war!******  Join the national movement and organize student walkouts and non-violent demonstrations.  Together let&rsquo;s build a mass movement in the streets, in our schools, and in our communities to end the Iraq War.**  On Feb. 5, 2007 rally at the gates of Fort Lewis, Washington or in your local community.</p>

<p>For courageously standing up and speaking out against the Iraq War, New Year&rsquo;s Eve 2007 may be Lt. Watada&rsquo;s last holiday as a free man until 2013.  While many 28 year-olds are starting their families and building their careers, Ehren will be locked away in military prison for following his conscience and refusing to fight in the Iraq War.</p>

<p>****<strong>Now it is time for you to follow your conscience and join the national movement to support Lt. Watada and end the Iraq war.</strong></p>

<p>As civilians, the responsibility ultimately falls on us to demand an end to the Iraq war.  In fact, we owe it to the soldiers who are fighting and dying in Iraq every day, as well as those resisting the war. We must all stand up and speak out against the war and in support Lt. Ehren Watada!</p>

<p>Currently, the Bush Administration is planning to deploy 30,000 more U.S. troops to Iraq, yet the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose the Iraq war. Since 2003 the war has cost 3,000 U.S. soldiers&rsquo; lives, approximately 950,000 Iraqi deaths, 2 trillion U.S tax dollars or approximately 8 billion dollars a week. We can no longer stand by and continue to allow this great injustice to occur!</p>

<p>__<em>&ldquo;My fellow soldiers are fighting and dying in Iraq and their families are suffering because of the lies and deceptions crafted by the Bush Administration.  The Iraq war is not only a crime against domestic and international law but [it] is a terrible moral injustice against the Iraqi people.&rdquo;  Lt. Ehren Watada</em></p>

<p>As the first Army officer to publicly speak out against the war and refuse deployment to Iraq, Lt Watada will be punished by the U.S. Army with a maximum six years in prison.****** The military&rsquo;s intention IS to SILENCE VOICES OF RESISTANCE and make an example out of Lt. Watada.**</p>

<p>Lt. Watada&rsquo;s bold actions have raised the consciousness of thousands of Americans about the illegality and immorality of this war, but his actions alone will not stop the Iraq war.  If Lt. Watada is willing to sacrifice his freedom, then we, too, must voice our opposition and take action to end the war.</p>

<p>****<strong>Take Action Feb. 5, 2007 during Lt. Watada&rsquo;s military court martial and make your 2007 New Year&rsquo;s Resolution to Stand with Lt. Watada Against Illegal and Immoral War.</strong></p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m losing it&hellip;seriously&hellip;i think I&rsquo;m forgetting the meaning of words like &ldquo;peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;ceasefire&rdquo; and &ldquo;routine&rdquo;. Today I had a day off and went to meet a friend of mine from Bethlehem who has recently started a new job with UNESCO in Ramallah. We met for a long lunch and then went shopping in Ramallah&rsquo;s busy town centre. Then the army arrived. Bulldozers first, shunting parked cars out of the way, some into shop fronts. Close behind were the armoured jeeps. No announcements: tear-gas, then sound grenades, then live fire. A helicopter above, backing up he ground troops with overhead fire. We were caught so unaware that I have to admit we both panicked and fled with other shoppers, young and old into the nearest store. We flinched and held hands with every gunshot and explosion from the other side of the metal shutters. .</p>

<p>Of course, we needn&rsquo;t have worried. This was just a &ldquo;routine arrest operation&rdquo;. So tell me, am I losing it? Have I been here too long? What exactly is routine about four dead people and twenty seriously injured? Routine to me was mothers and children, on holiday from school, going about their business, buying food and clothes, meeting friends for lunch&hellip;.right?</p>

<p>Today in Palestine: Ramallah raided, Bethlehem raided, Tubas raided, two villages close to Bethlehem raided, four dead, 35 injured, 9 arrested, so far. But Israel wants only peace and to protect <em>itself</em> from terrorists. A new colony approved in the West Bank to house the illegal Israeli &ldquo;settlers&rdquo; removed from the Gaza strip; 55,000 new Israeli houses to be built on land stolen from the village I volunteer in, the village that now has an unemployment rate of around 75%&hellip;.peace?</p>

<p>Like I say, i really think i&rsquo;m losing it, I hear the words Israel speaks but my eyes won&rsquo;t let me believe them&hellip;anyone any advice for a confused girl?</p>

<p>Hello family and friends&hellip;</p>

<p>I am sorry it has been awhile since I sent an e-mail.  I have been able to
get a few pieces published and have been focusing on writing for those.
I have thought about sending them out to this list but I fear they would
be repetitive.  There is so little information out there that each piece I
write has a lot of the same background information.  One piece can be
found on Common Dreams at
<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views06/0910-23.htm">https://www.commondreams.org/views06/0910-23.htm</a></p>

<p>This weekend has been full of independence day celebrations here in
Mexico.  The Governor of Oaxaca usually does the &ldquo;grito&rdquo; or cry of
independence on the 15th in the main square.  Since the governor has been
banished from the state, APPO organized the celebration and an indigenous
man did the cry.  This had to be a first.  Governor Ulises had planned to
do it from another town in Oaxaca but the popular struggle was not going
allow that and in the end he didn&rsquo;t show his face.  Odd similarity to the
national situation where President Fox, too, was unable to give the
&ldquo;grito&rdquo; in the Mexico City main square because of Obrador and his
supporters so he had to do it in another town.</p>

<p>Below is the latest article I have written, the background info is
repetitive for you all but there is some up to date info and some broader
analysis.  Keep in mind this will be published in slingshot, an anarchist
newspaper, so this one is not written for a mainstream audience.</p>

<p>I do fear the movement may be facing some more repression soon so please
pass this info on to folks who might be interested, we have a lot of power
to stop such repression from the states if people are aware&hellip;</p>

<p>Graffiti calling for the ousting of the Governor of the state covers
almost every blank wall in the historic district of Oaxaca City.  The
Zócalo, or main square, and the 50 blocks that surround it have become the
home of the statewide teachers strike since the end of May.  The
encampment is surrounded by makeshift blockades of metal sheeting and
barbed wire, large pieces of concrete and in some cases reclaimed
government cars and buses keeping traffic of these streets.   Multicolored
tarps cover blankets and cardboard used at night to sleep on by the
thousands involved in the struggle, community kitchens gather donations
and prepare large pots of beans and rice, a clinic is set up by supportive
workers in the medical field to serve those who have left their villages
and homes and are living in the encampments.  Many teachers embroider,
read the latest movement communiqué, and gather in circles holding
meetings.  Banners from unions and municipalities from all over the state
supporting this popular struggle hang between trees and light posts.
Stencils depicting Mexico’s revolutionary heroes, calling for the people
to rise up and demanding the release of political prisoners are
everywhere.  This encampment in the main square marks where the movement
began last May, but it has since expanded and encampments can now be found
throughout the city.  They now surround all government buildings in the
city and protect the four radio stations and their transmitters that have
been taken over and are currently held by the movement.  These four
channels air march and meeting announcements, discussions, alerts and
calls for backup at the scenes of government repression of the movement.
This is just within Oaxaca City.  At least 200 villages in the state have
joined in and reclaiming their town halls.</p>

<p><strong>How the Movement Began</strong>
Seventy percent of the 3.5 million people who live in the state of Oaxaca
are indigenous.  Over half live in abject poverty, 35 percent do not have
piped water in their homes.  The Mexican constitution demands that all
children have the same access to education.  And yet today in Oaxaca the
average person spends only 5.6 years in school, two years less than the
national average. The conditions in the rural schools are extremely poor,
with a lack of basic infrastructure. Children often come to school hungry,
barefoot and are without desks, books and pencils.  For the past 26 years
Section 22 of the National Union of Education Workers has held an annual
statewide strike.  Some of the demands this year included raises, basic
supplies and breakfast for the students.  Each year the teachers camp out
in the main square of Oaxaca city until an adequate compromise is reached.
This year things played out a little different.  At 4:30 am on June 14th
while teachers and their families were sleeping, 3000 police raided the
encampment, a helicopter fired teargas from the sky, cops beat people,
burnt their belongings leaving over 100 people injured.  The teachers
resisted with sticks and rocks, reclaiming the square later the same day.
And they have remained ever since.</p>

<p><strong>Construction of the Popular Assembly</strong>
Immediately after the government repression a mega march was held where
400,000 people came to show support for the teachers. A new entity was
formed of the 350 organizations that mobilized alongside the teacher
strike called the Popular Assembly of the People of Oaxaca (APPO).
Through hours of meetings this organization has come to represent not just
the voice of the striking teachers but also the voice of all those in the
state who face oppression and injustice.  According to Florentino, a
member of the press committee, “APPO does not set out to impose any
decisions, what we set out to do is to integrate all the people so that
together we can organize and govern the state.” Without leaders and using
collective decision making, APPO advances daily with announcements of new
actions and strategies. The indigenous people of the region have a long
history with this type of organizational structure; many municipalities
are still run by the general assemblies under the traditional native
customs of usos y costumbres.  These assemblies are not affiliated with
political parties and select the municipal presidents who then lead by
following, accountable to those who selected them.</p>

<p>On August 16th and 17th APPO held a forum entitled “Building Democracy and
Governability in Oaxaca,”  with sessions covering the design of a new
state constitution, creating democracy from below, movement inclusion and
respect for diversity.  Since the formation of APPO, a clear consensus
decision was made to change the primary demand from those of the teachers’
to the resignation of the Governor of Oaxaca, Ulises Ruiz Ortiz.  Not only
because of his responsibility in the violent repression of their
democratic teachers&rsquo; strike but because he was brought to power through
fraud, and since the beginning of his term he has favored corporate
interests and undermined social organizations.</p>

<p><strong>Corrupt Governments and their Development Plans</strong>
Corrupt exploitive governments are nothing new to Oaxaca or to Mexico.  In
fact the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), made up of the
conservative right, light skinned, wealthy class, has held the position of
governor of Oaxaca for the past 80 years and all of Mexico for over 70
years, previous to the current President Vicente Fox’s rule.  There were
hopes for Fox to step out of the traditional exploitive role but his
party, the National Action Party (PAN), has carried on the PRI legacy of
neoliberal expansion, corruption and repression of social organizations.</p>

<p>With help from the leaders of the Central American countries, Fox
initiated Plan Puebla Panama, PPP, a neoliberal development mega project,
praised by the United States.  This project, claiming one of its main
goals is to improve the conditions for the people of the region, in
actuality is stealing land from indigenous people for infrastructure
projects to move resources more quickly into the hands of multinational
corporations and commodifying their culture for the tourist industry.  One
of the projects with huge implications for Oaxaca is the creation of a
super highway at Mexico’s skinniest point, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, in
order to move resources more readily across the land from the Atlantic to
the Pacific.  This transportation corridor will be surrounded with
sweatshops, maquiladoras, free of labor and environmental laws.  “For all
of these objectives, the government of Oaxaca is key to the realization of
the project,” explained Florentino.</p>

<p>Ulises Ruiz Ortiz is a carbon copy of the most corrupt PRI leadership
which exploits and represses the majority indigenous population to serve
the interests of foreign corporations and maintain nationwide PRI control,
a perfect match to prepare the region for the implementation of the PPP.
Unable to be elected democratically, Ulises was forced to steal his
position through vote buying, ballot box tampering and computer fraud.  On
December 1st 2004, his first day as Governor, 40 armed men including PRI
municipal leaders with police support occupied the Noticias, a major
newspaper for the region which covered illegitimacy of the election.  The
newspaper has been operating out of a different location ever since.  In
the 21 months that Governor Ulises Ruiz Ortiz has been in power 37 people
have been killed for political reasons.  With this record his response to
the democratic teachers strike on June 14th comes as no surprise.</p>

<p><strong>Government Repression Continues</strong>
The repressive tactics against the movement have continued since June
14th.  Arrest warrants have been issued for at least 80 movement “leaders”
including members of the teachers union.  Four have been abducted from the
street by unmarked vans, photos of one, a biologist, severely beaten were
seen in the local news.  The faces of the four political prisoners and a
strong call for their freedom can be seen wheat pasted throughout
downtown.  In response to that repression a march was held on August 10th,
20,000 attended with one days notice.  Half way through the march
government goons shot into the crowd killing José Jimenez Colmenares, a
mechanic and the husband of a teacher. Yet the movement remains dedicated
to not taking up arms.  Instead APPO has used the main strategy of
creating a situation of ungovernability in Oaxaca preventing the state
government from meeting, orchestrating state wide strikes, blockading bank
and wealthy business, and controlling transportation through highway
stoppages.</p>

<p>In late August the federal government finally agreed to negotiations with
APPO and 28 representatives, half teachers, went to Mexico City.  These
negotiations are not likely to go anywhere because the federal government
refuses to back down and the movement is unwilling to compromise on the
resignation of Ulises Ruiz Ortiz. A teacher living in an encampment
outside one of the radio stations explained “Some compañeros want to
accept the crumbs that the federal government is offering us and say that
maybe we better return to class so that this can end peacefully, as if
nothing has happened, but there are a lot of us that say no, because this
would imply forgetting the reality that we have been living until now.  I
insist this type of repression before has not been seen in Oaxaca and if
we allow it, believe me when I say, that we would condemn the state of
Oaxaca to live like this.  Something that would not only affect the
teachers but every social group that would want to rise up in the
future.”</p>

<p><strong>Power of Community Radio</strong>
Radio has played a very significant role in this movement, giving new
voice to the voiceless.  A radio station, created by the striking teachers
with community support was destroyed by the police during the June 14th
repression.  In response, students from the Autonomous University of
Benito Juarez reclaimed their radio station, Radio Universidad, and it
became the means of communication for the movement.  It too was shot into
by government goons and acid was poured on the transmitter, destroying the
station.  On August 1st a 3000 strong women’s march moved through downtown
clanging pots and pans, in the spirit of the march of “cacerolas” in
Chile, and calling for the resignation of the state governor of Oaxaca,
Ulises Ruiz Ortiz.  Leila, a member of the women’s coordination committee
of APPO explained, “The pots and pans reflect that in Oaxacan homes, there
is no food.  In a country where there is no justice, no equality, where
there is no respect for human rights, these pans are not only empty of
food but also of these basic principles.”</p>

<p>After the march ended in the main square, a contingent of 500 women
decided to take over Channel 9 CORTV, a state wide television station and
its two affiliated radio stations.  After a few hours the women got the
channel back on the air.  They began to express many reasons for the
takeover, to continue the pressure for the governor’s resignation, to
reclaim the space for the community, to air the news that is not getting
covered and to use the mode of communication for organizing and spreading
word of the needs of the movement.   On August 21st police and government
goons attacked the transmitter control room for Channel 9 taking it and
two affiliated radio stations off the air.  A contingency plan had been
created and within hours 11 radio stations were under the control of
movement members, many of them women from Channel 9.</p>

<p>Encampments and street blockades were set up protect the new stations from
plain clothed cops and paramilitaries who appear at night and fire into
the encampments.  One movement member guarding radio station was killed
bringing the total deaths to eight.  This repression has had the opposite
effects of its apparent goals to disable the movement with fear, instead,
more and more people can be found sleeping in the encampments outside the
radio stations and the determination of the people seems stronger and
stronger. On September 3rd APPO declared the Governor banned from the
state and have essentially taken over control of the state.  Florentino
explained, “For us the process of destruction of the government and the
resignation of Ulises has already ended so that a phase of construction
can begin, of creating governability, of showing that we are capable of
governing ourselves.”</p>

<p>In this National Climate the Winds of Oaxaca Reach Far and Wide
While the people have managed, at least for the time being to reclaim
Oaxaca from the hands of the corrupt and repressive leadership, on the
national level Felipe Calderon, with the help of the conservative Federal
Election Commission (TRIFE), has managed to fraudulently steal the
national presidency.  On September 6th TRIFE unanimously handed the
presidency of Mexico to Calderon even though he had only half a percent
lead out of 41.6 million votes over the left PRD candidate Manuel Lopez
Obrador amidst an immense amount of evidence pointing to fraud.  Obrador,
who some on the left have criticized as a moderate, has campaigned on
helping the poor and is refusing to back down, mobilizing millions against
the fraud in Mexico City.</p>

<p>In preparation for the his final State of the Union address on September
1st, President Fox planned to keep the Obrador supporters at bay with 10
foot tall metal barricades, thousands of armed federal police, water
cannons and military snipers stationed on rooftops of surrounding
buildings.  He did not foresee the 155 senators and congress members who
felt the election was fraudulent and who prevented the speech from the
inside by taking over the podium.  Fox ended up giving a televised
address.  On September 16th at a National Democratic Convention for the
people voted Obrador as President of a “parallel government” with plans to
prevent Calderon from taking office on December 1st.  Those in power
continue to try and carry on with business as usual.  According to a White
House spokesperson, two days after Calderon was handed the presidency,
George Bush expressed the desire to “meet at the earliest mutually
convenient opportunity” especially to move forward on Plan Puebla to
Panama.  Try as they might, they can not continue to ignore what is being
created in the poor and indigenous communities in Oaxaca and throughout
Mexico.</p>

<p>“The worry that is maybe the biggest of all is the fear of being
repressed, the fear of being incarcerated, the fear of being harshly
beaten, and of course, the fear of dying because that is what we are
exposed to,” states a teacher afraid to share his name.  Yet the dignity
and courage in his eyes and in the eyes of so many suggests to me that
perhaps the strength of this mass mobilization of people with justice in
their hearts and a clear understanding of the roots of their exploitation
in their minds can withstand this brutal repression.  The largest defense
against this repression is international solidarity as we have seen
throughout the Zapatista uprisings in Chiapas.  APPO has recently called
for international solidarity, for actions at Mexican consulates throughout
the world.  This struggle for human rights and self determination is not
new and what they are resisting is clearly not confined to Oaxaca.  In
fact Oaxaca is simply another front in this global struggle for social
justice.  And we, in the belly of the beast, where it is the easiest to
carry on and maintain the status quo, we must stand tall and not let a
single casualty in this struggle go unnoticed.  We gain strength with each
exploitive act and development plan that increases the distance between
the very rich and the growing poor.  Throughout the Americas things are
changing.  In South America the grass roots movements are expanding,
electing left leadership.  And in the states the immigrant rights
movements are on the move.  The potential for solidarity is endless.  The
Former Chiapas Bishop Samuel Ruíz García, a long time advocate for the
poor and indigenous communities, attended an APPO forum. In the closing
ceremonies he stated, “…it might be that we are standing in two time
dimensions, the past and the future. In these days we are living something
that we are leaving, and cement is being placed beneath something that
doesn’t come automatically but is the result of working together, of our
construction.”</p>

                        <p>##13:45 Sunday 27 August 2006</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2006/EDUCATION/08/06/sept11.theories.ap/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2006/EDUCATION/08/06/sept11.theories.ap/index.html</a></p>

<p>I do not buy that 911 was an inside job by the government.  I can buy that the Neocons in the Bush admin potentially knew something was up and did nothing in order to create public sentiment that would rally behind the flag and agree to their extreme foriegn policy agenda, but that&rsquo;s a far cry from orchestrating the event and attacking your own nation with missiles, etc.  I don&rsquo;t believe that this happened, but I see the motivation that they may have had.</p>

<p>I heard James Fetzer, the co-founder of the Scholars for <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> Truth on a radio interview.  The guy claimed that some of the hijackers are still alive and living in Europe.  He claimed that the BBc had interviewed them on TV.  The radio host (of a liberal talk show) felt obligate dto follow-up on that point and googled for signs of this and could not find one orginal article on the BBC website.  So then he wanted to make sure that he tried hard enough to research the claim, and he called the BBC and tried to find a producer over there that knew anything about this.  The BBC producers laughed at him and hung up on him.</p>

<p>Furthermore, from listening to this guy, I truly believe that these people are just letting their emotion get the best of them.  This Fetzer guy claimed that he has experts that say that as few as 10 trips to the WTC could hav ebeen made prior to 911 to strategically place explosives, and because its such a small number of trips, that we should believe that no one saw anyone preparing the building for demolition.  I heard this and thought it was outrageous on its face.  If yo&rsquo;ve ever watched a documentary on demolitions of this type, they have to drill into the structural supports of the building with giant hammer-drills that pound away at the concrete like a jack-hammer while they are drilling.  On top of that, even if they only made 10 trips, as he says, they&rsquo;d have to carry at least a couple huge packages of explosives into the building.  So my question is &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think that *<strong>anyone</strong> who worked in the WTC would have seen a guy walking around with a dufflebag full of explosives and a giant hammer-drill?  &hellip;and these guys would not have been simply walking down the stairwells.  from what i understand about these buildings, the main structural supports were (1) the center shaft of the building that housed the elevators/electrical/plumbing, and (2) the outter skin of the building.  How could someone access these parts of the building, drill into cement with a hammer-drill, place a whole bunch of explosives at key points, and still not have anyone notice???!!!???  Its simple common sense to me.  It just could not have happened.</p>

<p>Secondly, and much more damming to their assertion, is the fact that no one from within the conspiracy has come forward.  Something like a dozen people have left the Bush administration on bad terms and many have written tell-all books that the administration has been furious about.  The list is long and distinguished:  Colin Powell, Christie Whitman, Richard Clarke, Paul O&rsquo;Neil, Thomas White, Eric Shenseki, Lawrence Wilkerson.  &hellip;and all these people were let go for telling the truth.   &hellip;and many of them have said on the record that the Bush administration wante dto go to war with Iraq from day one.  If 911 was an inside job, why wouldn&rsquo;t any of these people, who already have been fire for telling the truth, come forward and spill the beans?  But what&rsquo;s even a more obvious question is: a plan like this would have to be comprised of at least dozens of people and potentially hundreds of people; why has not one person surfaced and said &ldquo;I know the whole story and it was an inside job&rdquo;.  You simply cannot keep a secret like this.  Its impossible.  For crying out loud, people leak less important stuff nearly everyday.  Surely, there would be a leaker if this were true.  But there isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, but there is simply no evidence that 911 was an inside job and I am getting tired of explaining this to people.  I hate what Bush has done to the country more than anyone and I&rsquo;d love to get him out of office, and I think he deserves to go to jail for some of the things he&rsquo;s done, so I am not some salute-the-president happy republican here.  I think that two things contribute to people&rsquo;s willingness to buy these conspiracy theories (1) peoples&rsquo; hatred for Bush, and (2) people&rsquo;s understandable feeling that they don&rsquo;t want to believe that a few simpletons with box cutters could take down an American icon.  These two factors cloud people&rsquo;s ability to see things objectively.</p>

<p>Lastly, I am not saying that there are not unanswered questions.  I think that the 911 commission was way too easy on alot of people.  The mere fact that the president got a brief titled &ldquo;Bin Laden Determined to Attack USA&rdquo; on 08/06/2001 is evidence that these clowns were goofing around in the white house when they should have been protecting America.  At least when Clinton was getting head in the oval office, no one attacked the country.  Bush took a 6 week vacation right before both Katrina and 911!!!</p>

                        <p>##21:43 Sunday 13 August 2006</p>

<p>Hello all…</p>

<p>So things in Oaxaca are intensifying and fast.</p>

<p>Last week there was a 2000+ womens&rsquo; march of the Popular Assembly of the</p>

<p>State of Oaxaca (APPO).  A quick recap, this is the organization that</p>

<p>formed after the June 14th police repression of the striking teachers</p>

<p>union SNTE Section 22.  APPO is made up of the teachers as well as a huge</p>

<p>variety of social organizations who support the teachers.  Since APPO&rsquo;s</p>

<p>formation the main goal has been to force the resignation of the</p>

<p>right-wing corrupt governor of Oaxaca State, Ulises Ruiz Ortiz.  The main</p>

<p>method being used to acheive this is to use nonviolent tactics to stop the</p>

<p>state government from functioning.  The state Government House, the State</p>

<p>Congress and the Oaxaca Superior Tribunal of Justice, the Department of</p>

<p>Finances, the General Attorney’s office, the penal tribunals, and other</p>

<p>facilities have all been blockaded.</p>

<p>So back to the women, after marching for five miles they nonviolently took</p>

<p>over the state tv station and have controlled it ever since.  It took them</p>

<p>a few hours to get it up and running but since then they have been playing</p>

<p>the footage of the June 14th repression, the march of 400,000 teachers and</p>

<p>growing number of supporters 2 weeks later, and other indymedia style</p>

<p>documentaries of class struggles going on throughout Mexico.  They even</p>

<p>played a documentay on the oppression faced by the Palestinians.  The</p>

<p>media here is controlled by the wealthy and those in power, like in the</p>

<p>states, so these things had never made it on to television.  The televison</p>

<p>station also has two affilited radio stations which the women now control</p>

<p>as well.</p>

<p>The movement has truly been growing, the largest mass movement I have ever</p>

<p>witnessed.  It is spreading throughout the whole state of Oaxaca. 40</p>

<p>municipalities and towns around the state have made changes to those in</p>

<p>power, 20 municipal town halls are currently occupied. Nineteen</p>

<p>municipalities have joined APPO and have sent people here to Oaxaca city</p>

<p>to further the struggle.  APPO has set up road blockades through out the</p>

<p>state and have taken over 6o public buses and 18 government cars.</p>

<p>Last week it was clear that APPO was acheiving its goals.  The movement</p>

<p>was growing and its voice was loud and clear through the women on the</p>

<p>television and radio stations and the university radio station.  Then on</p>

<p>the night of  August 6th, although denied by President Vicente Fox, 300</p>

<p>officers of the Federal Preventive Police arrived in the city.  On the</p>

<p>8th, 30 police men dressed in civilian clothing tried to disperse one of</p>

<p>the blockades in front of an occupied public building with tear gas and</p>

<p>gunfire.  One woman was shot in the leg.  Then the repression began to</p>

<p>show up all over the city in a series of events which I will list below to</p>

<p>keep it short&hellip;</p>

<p>August 7th</p>

<p>Two men start a bus on fire outside the university radio station as a</p>

<p>distraction, they then proceed to throw acid on the transmitter.  Radio</p>

<p>Universidad is shutdown.</p>

<p>A NGO leader is disappeared.</p>

<p>A university professor is shot dead in his car.</p>

<p>August 8th</p>

<p>A leading indigenous rights advocate and active in APPO, who is wheelchair</p>

<p>bound from past police torture, is picked up by masked men in an unmarked</p>

<p>car and disappeared with two men who were with him.</p>

<p>Two men enter the state newspaper, Noticias, which has been sympathetic to</p>

<p>the struggle and shoot into the air.</p>

<p>August 10th</p>

<p>The government of Oaxaca announced arrest warrants for 50 leaders of APPO,</p>

<p>including many NGO leaders and leaders within the teachers union Section</p>

<ol>
<li>According to the Secretary of Public Security, this is to “guarantee<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>the safety” of the state.</p>

<p>Also yesterday, a march was called by APPO against this repression and for</p>

<p>the release of those who have been disappeared.  At least 20,000 people</p>

<p>marched through the streets.  From the sidelines of the march shots were</p>

<p>fired killing one man, the husband of a teacher. The house that the shots</p>

<p>came from was rented by the police and a federal police badge was found</p>

<p>inside. Today APPO held a huge procession for the man who was killed</p>

<p>during the march into the center square, thousands attended the funeral</p>

<p>and chants that the struggle will continue were repeated for hours.</p>

<p>I believe the movement in Oaxaca has become a strong and diverse class</p>

<p>struggle against the corrupted officials and business-people who have been</p>

<p>in power in Oaxaca for decades. The state of Oaxaca is 70 percent</p>

<p>indigenous and has a long history of resistance and struggle.  Those in</p>

<p>power have begun a dirty war against the movement and I fear for these</p>

<p>brave people who continue to take a strong stand against extreme injustice</p>

<p>and corruption even as they see their fellow compañer@s fall.</p>

<p>And I encourage any of you that are able to make a call or write to</p>

<p>Vicente Fox and others to demand an end to this repression and respect for</p>

<p>human rights in the state of Oaxaca.  Contact info to follow&hellip;</p>

<p>That is from a thread between me, Dude and my brother after the announcement that we can&rsquo;t bring drinks onto planes anymore:</p>

<p>From: American Embassy Tokyo
Date: Aug 11, 2006 10:57 AM
Subject: Public Announcement</p>

<p><snip></p>

<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is implementing a series of security measures, some visible and some not visible, to ensure the security of the traveling public and the nation&rsquo;s transportation system.</p>

<p>NO LIQUIDS OR GELS OF ANY KIND WILL BE PERMITTED IN CARRY-ON BAGGAGE. SUCH ITEMS MUST BE IN CHECKED BAGGAGE.</p>

<p>This includes all beverages, shampoo, suntan lotion, creams, tooth paste, hair gel, and other items of similar consistency</p>

<p>Exceptions: Baby formula and breast milk if a baby or small child is traveling and medicines, which must be presented for inspection at the checkpoint.</p>

<p><snip></p>

<p>From: Dude</p>

<p>what&rsquo;s crazy is that they are still allowing each person to carry two books of matches!!!  I really do not get this.  You cannot smoke on planes and in most airports.  Smoking is not vital to national security, and its a horrible public health problem.  oh yeah&hellip;.  the tobacco lobby gives alot of money to politicians.  Now I get it.</p>

<hr />

<p>From: Rob</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s infuriating!   _(ed. note: I am a genius!)</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">_</h2>

<p>From: Fred</p>

<p>the whole thing is a pile of shit.  chertoff is a complete idiot.  he is fourth on my list of people to hate after karl rove, dick cheney, and donald rumsfeld.  oh, and speaking of karl rove, i want to kick robert novak in the nuts for protecting him, and then patrick fitzgerald for giving rove immunity.  whatever company novak works for, i am never giving them money ever.</p>

<p>but back to air travel.  i mean, the system <em>worked</em>!  the bad guys got caught!  the us/uk cops could have intervened weeks ago, but they decided to wait until the shit was going down before arresting anybody, and now look at what&rsquo;s happened: water is the new terrorist threat.</p>

<p>recall that idiot who tried to light his shoes on fire.  everyone now knows the score: the civilized hijackings of the seventies are over. if guy says he has a bomb, you&rsquo;re all going to die anyway&ndash;bum rush him.  problem solved, just like on united 93.  no need for extra security, we can take care of things ourselves.  but what&rsquo;s happened? we still have to take off our shoes or get the wand, even years later! it&rsquo;s completely stupid, and it&rsquo;s a health risk.</p>

<p>people, people.  it&rsquo;s a fucking <em>bus</em>.  get on, sit down, and shut up.
there is no magic any more.  it is not a luxury cruise.  you cannot be &ldquo;secure.&rdquo;  you fly a plane cause it&rsquo;s <em>faster</em>, not because it&rsquo;s cheaper or safer.</p>

<p>i am writing a letter to my congressman telling him that he&rsquo;d better get it in gear or i&rsquo;m not voting for him.  no incumbents.  fuck you guys.</p>

<hr />

<p>From: Dude</p>

<p>amen!!!  I totally agree that any MF who tried anything on a plane would get bum-rushed and killed by passengers.  I know I&rsquo;d be one of the people kicking the guy&rsquo;s ass.  I&rsquo;d let out all of the anger I have at the bush administration on that dude.  he&rsquo;d be toast.  hahaha.</p>
