      <description>23:14 Sunday 02 December 2018 JST In 2017, Masuda Futoshi was fined 150,000 yen for tattooing customers without a medical license. Recently, the Japanese high court reversed the decision. Tattoos have historical and artistic significance. Tattoos are social customs in modern society. Therefore the court decided ”tattoos are fundamentally different from medical work.” Tattoos have traditionally been an art form for many years. The decision to call them medical treatment is hard to defend.</description>

      <description> 06:55 Saturday 29 September 2018 JST 
長い休みが終わり、学校に子どもたちの元気な声が戻ってきました。日焼けした顔も多く、 体も大きくなった子も多くいるようです。始まりの朝会では４人の転入生も交えて笑顔 いっぱいスタートしました。休みの間、無事に過ごせたのは、ご家庭の皆様や地域の皆様の 見守りがあってこそです。ありがとうございました。 朝会の時に話をしたことですが、今年の夏は、高校野球の甲子園大会を１０年ぶりくら いに熱心に見ました。100回記念大会ということで開催前から注目を集めていましたが、 大会が進むほどに秋田の金足農業高校の活躍に胸を暑くされた方も多いと思います。他の 学校との比較で「雑草軍団」とも言われましたが、過去にも甲子園大会出場経験があり、 ５０人もの部員を抱える強豪校です。なぜこんなにも話題となり人々の心を動かしたか・・。 色々な要因が考えられます。まずは、部員が秋田県出身者ばかりという点。公立高校なの で全国規模で優秀な選手を集められる私立校とは少し異なります。地元の子どもたちが 強豪校を次々と破っていく姿に、まず県内での応援が盛り上がりました。また、吉祥戦 の相手、大阪登園高校が、規格外の強さをもち2回目の春夏連ばを狙っているチームだった ということ。さらに、ベンチ入りした選手のうち９人が３年生で、この９人で本線をずっと 勝ち抜いたという点。代わりがいない少人数で、いわゆるおらがクラスメイト達の頑張って いるイメージが、日本人の心に訴えるものが大きかったのでしょう。大人は頑張ってる 子どもを無条件で応援したくなるものです。 学校スポーツですので、学校の仲間が力を合わせていくことに大きな意義があります。こ れは、小学校生活でも同じです。隣の席に座っている友達、同じ教室の友達、近所に住 む友達などとのかかわりの中で学べることが多くあります。時には、そのかかわりが心ざ わつかせることもあろと思いますが、その色々な経験が心を深く育てていきます。決 して目を話すぎてはいけませんが、かかわりを通して成長していくと考えて、長い目で 見守ってきたいと思います。  </description>

Scott Brown on Facebook Friendonomics
 Friending has subsumed the ol&amp;rsquo; Rolodex. Granted, it&amp;rsquo;s often convenient to have all of your contacts under one roof. But the great thing about the Rolodex was that it never talked back, it didn&amp;rsquo;t throw virtual octopi or make you take movie quizzes, and it never, ever poked you.
 Excellent (and funny!) description of what&amp;rsquo;s happened to the word &amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; in the online world&amp;hellip;</description>

Afghanistan Facing &amp;ldquo;Downward Spiral&amp;rdquo;, National Intelligence Estimate Draft Report Highlights Afghanistan&amp;rsquo;s Accelerated Deterioration - CBS News
 The nearly completed National Intelligence Estimate, the work of 16 intelligence agencies, says Afghanistan&amp;rsquo;s deterioration has accelerated alarmingly in past two months. Bush administration officials say privately that Afghanistan is now the single most pressing security threat in the fight against terrorism.
 What a nightmare we&amp;rsquo;ve caused. And with this Estimate saying we have to go in there and kill &amp;lsquo;em more will just make things worse and worse.</description>

 Police questioned a group of Georgia third-graders suspected in a plot to kill their teacher
 3rd grade kill teacher plot - Google News
This was published around April 1st, but I&amp;rsquo;d be surprised if someone wrote this as a joke! I&amp;rsquo;m pretty shocked to think that such violence could be actually considered by the children.

&amp;lsquo;Virtual Fence&amp;rsquo; Along Border To Be Delayed - washingtonpost.com
 Boeing has already been paid $20.6 million for the pilot project, and in December, the DHS gave the firm another $65 million to replace the software with military-style, battle management software.
 This, for some reason, seems shocking to me. Okay, so this is for a virtual fence 28 miles long. The $20.6 million price works out to almost $140 / foot.</description>

 He also said technology that can travel so far and fast through space would disrupt the energy infrastructure, making dependency on fossil fuels obsolete — a notion corporate stockholders would reject. Knowing the government knew such technology existed for decades also likely would enrage the public, he added, given the current energy crisis and the number of years that evidence has been available.</description>

 It was not clear how long ago the satellite lost power, or under what circumstances.
 Discovery News : Spy Satellite Could Crash to Earth
It&amp;rsquo;s a spy satellite!! How can they not know when it lost power? It seems more likely that someone knows quite well exactly when it lost power, but just didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything publicly.
BUT&amp;hellip;. maybe there are just so many spy satellites all on autopilot that someone didn&amp;rsquo;t notice?</description>

 A nightmare even worse than bankruptcy for Nova staff and students would be if the corporation soldiered on after all hope was lost, said Carlet.
 &amp;ldquo;If they don&amp;rsquo;t officially go bankrupt that means the teachers won&amp;rsquo;t be dismissed, they just won&amp;rsquo;t be paid, and if they resign they&amp;rsquo;d have to wait three months (for unemployment insurance), and if they don&amp;rsquo;t resign we have to prove that it&amp;rsquo;s effectively a bankruptcy, which takes time, so either way they&amp;rsquo;re in serious trouble if Nova doesn&amp;rsquo;t officially go bankrupt.</description>

 NOVA was late paying their staff last month and that the company issued a 750 million yen corporate bond at the beginning of August, which I assumed gave it the cash to pay instructors this month (which was the 15th or 20th - could someone confirm for me?). My own estimates put their foreign staff payroll in the range of 910-1040 million yen per month, so with some cash lying around, it seems they just managed to squeak by this month.</description>

I think I&amp;rsquo;m losing it&amp;hellip;seriously&amp;hellip;i think I&amp;rsquo;m forgetting the meaning of words like &amp;ldquo;peace&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ceasefire&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;routine&amp;rdquo;. Today I had a day off and went to meet a friend of mine from Bethlehem who has recently started a new job with UNESCO in Ramallah. We met for a long lunch and then went shopping in Ramallah&amp;rsquo;s busy town centre. Then the army arrived. Bulldozers first, shunting parked cars out of the way, some into shop fronts.</description>

Hello family and friends&amp;hellip;
I am sorry it has been awhile since I sent an e-mail. I have been able to get a few pieces published and have been focusing on writing for those. I have thought about sending them out to this list but I fear they would be repetitive. There is so little information out there that each piece I write has a lot of the same background information.</description>

I do not buy that 911 was an inside job by the government. I can buy that the Neocons in the Bush admin potentially knew something was up and did nothing in order to create public sentiment that would rally behind the flag and agree to their extreme foriegn policy agenda, but that&amp;rsquo;s a far cry from orchestrating the event and attacking your own nation with missiles, etc.</description>

Hello all…
So things in Oaxaca are intensifying and fast.
Last week there was a 2000+ womens&amp;rsquo; march of the Popular Assembly of the
State of Oaxaca (APPO). A quick recap, this is the organization that
formed after the June 14th police repression of the striking teachers
union SNTE Section 22. APPO is made up of the teachers as well as a huge
variety of social organizations who support the teachers.</description>

 the civilized hijackings of the seventies are over. if guy says he has a bomb, you&amp;rsquo;re all going to die anyway&amp;ndash;bum rush him. problem solved, just like on united 93. no need for extra security, we can take care of things ourselves.
 That is from a thread between me, Dude and my brother after the announcement that we can&amp;rsquo;t bring drinks onto planes anymore:</description>

Wow. Just watched Radio starring Cuba Gooding Jr and Ed Harris.. Super awesome movie relaying the true story of a perpetual student/coach/fixture in a high school. Set in the mid 70s, there is a certain bit of tension between black vs white and football-lovin&amp;rsquo; vs people-lovin&amp;rsquo; people. No blood, no overt violence. Really a great story and a great movie. Kudos to those who put it together, and Kudos to Radio for showing people the light.</description>

By now you may be aware that I am in Jerusalem with the four other delegates from the Olympia-Rafah Sister City Project, and Cindy and Craig Corrie. We chose to leave Gaza Wednesday morning after two men came to our apartment late Tuesday night asking us to go with them under the false pretense that we would be safer staying in their home. Our host in Rafah recognized this as an attempt to kidnap us and cautiously navigated the situation resulting in the bizarre scenario of the men shaking each of our hands and leaving.</description>

 With an absurd system for color-coding dangers to Americans, the President, Vice President, and the highest officials in this land were able to paint the media a &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; incendiary orange and the Democrats an &amp;ldquo;elevated&amp;rdquo; bright yellow, functionally sidelining them. How stunningly in recent weeks the landscape has altered&amp;hellip;

 Some planning experts fear that if developers get their way, New Orleans will be reincarnated as a bland, soulless shell of a once-great southern city.
 Katrinaâs Displaced Move to Defend New Orleans from Elite Visionaries
Earlier, I surmised New Orleans could be raised like Galveston was back in the day. Now I realize there is one significant difference in the two situations. Galveston was a really wealthy city at the time of their hurricane.</description>

Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s Google To Buddy Up With NASA - Forbes.com
This one looks pretty damn cool.
According to another article, Google will open up a million square feet worth of office space in NASA Ames research center.
My goodness it would be good to have a few hundred GOOG shares right about now.
Barring that, I look foward to seeing Google Mars and Google Moon. I want to see how they represent the alien station on the far side of the moon.</description>

Guardian | 600 barrels of loot found on Crusoe island
Obviously the money belongs to Arturito. Finders, keepers. Too bad he&amp;rsquo;s not sentient, yet.
What would a sentient robot do with $10B?
It sounds like too much money for it to be good news, ya know? Papal rings??? Incan statues??
I seriously think it should be excavated by ARCHAEOLOGISTS, and super tight security around the whole thing.</description>
