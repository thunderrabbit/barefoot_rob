<p>I got Lin the 2014 Harrod&rsquo;s bear, &ldquo;Jasper&rdquo; (I think).  I&rsquo;ve
essentially promised her one each year, but each year I try to
convince her that she doesn&rsquo;t need another so she won&rsquo;t expect it when
she receives it.</p>

<p>No pics yet but they might be on my mom&rsquo;s FB wall already.</p>

<p>Ma, Mama, Lin, Fred, and I shared gifts and laughter.   I had the most fun watching Lin unwrap her teddy bear.  The outer box was apparently mailed from Fred to me, the next inner box was from me to Fred; the next inner box was from Fred to Lin; the next inner box was from Lin to Lin; the next inner box was from Lin to Ma; the next inner bag was from Ma to Mama; the next inner box was from Mama to me, but that box was actually for Lin, which she could see very clearly from its branding.  Lin was totally excited, and I&rsquo;m totally pleased that it worked so well.</p>

<p>In addition to shampoo I requested, Fred got me a 3D model puzzle of the Burj Khalifa, plus another old puzzle from back in the day (of which he has two copies).</p>

<p>Lin got me an RC helicopter with camera on it!!  I wonder how many times I&rsquo;ll be able to fly it successfully.</p>

<p>In addition to dental floss I requested, Ma got (the dry) chocolate chip cookie making ingredients for Lin and me (except for flour).</p>

<p>For fun, Fred brought one of the old sets of <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=321011097812">Tipovers</a> that we had back in the day.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>Yesterday Fred and I rode his unicycle around more and tossed my new
frisbee-ish thing (collapseable hinged ring) and then I went home.  My
butt hurts from unicycling.</p>

<p>Today Channing IMed me and asked about KTRU.  After I told him all our
music types, he was all, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s Navrang?&rdquo;  I told him it was music from
India (but I&rsquo;m afraid even that might be wrong), and that&rsquo;s all I know.
Turns out he was able to listen on RealAudio, so I called Alison at the
station and requested some Navrang for him.</p>

<p>On the air, she prepended the song, &ldquo;this is for a request in Tulsa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Channing loved it!  He asked if I would tape a copy for him.  No sweat.</p>

<hr />

<p>Work was short and sweet (I ate a lot of chocolate) and we got paid
early (&ldquo;Just in case you might need the cash around Y2K&rdquo;).  Phat.  I
love my job!</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>Presents and cookies at Ma&rsquo;s in College Station then I surprised
everyone by arriving at Dad&rsquo;s in Magnolia.  Fred was there; he had
decided at the last minute to fly in to town (his plans at Berkeley fell
through).  I am so glad to have seen him unwrap the crazy gift!  He
required 1.3 hours to unwrap it.  Really.  That time does not include a
break for dinner.  I was quite pleased with my handiwork.</p>

<p>Fred was quite pleased with the gifts: a 2x2x2 Rubik&rsquo;s cube, and a small
wooden puzzle called TAKITAPART.  There is some historical significance
on the gifts:</p>

<pre><code>Fred now owns a 2x2x2 cube, a 3x3x3 cube, a 4x4x4 cube, and a 5x5x5
</code></pre>

<p>cube.<br />
    He can solve the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 and <em>almost</em> the 4x4x4!
    He has no chance on the 5x5x5 yet.  But I trust he&rsquo;ll do it sometime
    in his life.</p>

<pre><code>The TAKITAPART is identical to a puzzle that our grandad (Ma's dad) had
back in the day.  Grandad had tons of puzzles.  Hundreds.  And we were
eventually able to solve them all.  Except this one.  Grandad could
solve it in about 10 seconds.  We have never figured it out.
-- So I got Fred the identical puzzle, and we were able to solve it in
about 30 minutes.  Turns out it's not the same puzzle.  It looks the
same, but is not actually the same.  Hmmm.
</code></pre>

<p>Fred and I did dishes after supper and then took his unicycle down to
the local elementary school to get a few practice runs on it.  I was
able to get about 20 feet, Fred more consistently about 30 feet.  We&rsquo;re
no experts, but getting better.  I expect he&rsquo;ll be able to ride it by
the time I see him again.
I am sure I will be envious.</p>

<p>We got freezing cold (40 F) so we back to the house we were talking some
BS when Fred mentioned that Karen (dad&rsquo;s new girlfriend) said she likes
all types of music.</p>

<p>HA!</p>

<p>So I called KTRU.  Curtis was there.  &ldquo;Hey Curtis, this is Rob.  Will
you play something off the CD <em>Japanese / American Noise
Treaty</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said he would be happy to, so we made sure Karen and Dad could hear
the stereo.</p>

<p>Fred had never heard such noise and I joined him in eyewatering laughter
&ldquo;I like all music!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But even better: Curtis came back on after the song and said, &ldquo;that was
requested _________  a cover of _________.  It&rsquo;s a nice song; I like to
sing along with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if.  Fred described the sound later as &ldquo;worse than static, cause at
least you can ignore static.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s hard static with blown out screaming
and halts and it&rsquo;s just tough as hell.</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in College Station now after a candle light service at church.  (My
mom is a UU minister)  The service was full of carols and candles, but I
didn&rsquo;t feel much like participating; my nose was all snuffly and stuff.
It&rsquo;s not the same here without Fred.  Also conspicuously missing is
Karina, me an&rsquo; Fred&rsquo;s step sister, although Alicia is here (our other
step-sis), but she is not a boistrous as Karina.</p>

<p>Big stuff recently:</p>

<p>1) I am HIV negative
2) I switched our ISP at work (T1 to DSL)
3) We got nice Christmas bonuses at work $473, which ain&rsquo;t much,
   but a ton more than at Telecheck
4) I&rsquo;m in the process of moving my website to robnugen.com
5) Wende and I are exclusively dating
6) I&rsquo;m still climbing out of debt
7) Yahoo (YHOO) stock is going crazy up: $405/share now;
   I bought 5 at $209
8) I wrapped Fred&rsquo;s gift ridiculously tightly in some 20 layers
   of tape and cardboard and wrapping paper.</p>

<hr />

<p class=date>5am</p>

<p>Oh my goodness; I got up to P and Ma was awake, just chillin&rsquo; drinking
some hot tea.  We talked a bit and she got sleepy and then I was awake
so I started calling my credit card companies to see where exactly my
balances are.  Talked to Jennifer, who, for Christmas, removed $40
finance charge!!  My remaining balance was only $50 (it had been $3000,
but I transferred the balance to a different card) and I had her pay the
rest via phone, and <em>bang</em> the card is paid off!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna send her a thank you note!</p>

<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p><p>The zoo was cool.  We went to every exhibit, except that I noticed
we did not see girraffes.  The reptiles were cool.  This will all be
written haphazardly, since I want to write about what just happened.
At the zoo, we saw a huge ass <em>green moray</em>.  It was in a tank
with a nurse shark and a lemon shark.  We saw some huge ass snakes,
too.  We saw the gorilla do this (on his back the entire time): Long
slow lazy scratches on his belly, scratching toward his crotch,
flipped his back legs up by his ears, long slow scratches from chest
to crotch.</p>

<p><p>We saw lions doing weird stuff.  (I think one was in heat and the
others were trying to hump her) But one of the lion&rsquo;s tail was being
chewed on by the 3 lions including herself.</p>

<p><p>At Emerson, I met Amy &amp; Janna, daughters of Jan, minister of
Emerson.  They were pretty.  After the thing, me, Cheri, &amp; Ma stopped
by Transco falls and the City Hall Christmas lights.  I took Cheri
home and then came home to Tomball.</p>

<p><p>Just now, Fred said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who can eat the most sweet tarts.&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;Crud. I had wanted to save some for tomorrow..&rdquo; We each
crammed 27 Sweet Tarts into our mouths.  Try it.  We could not chew.
We started to laugh - cracking up laughing. Dying laughing.  We had to
go outside so as to not cough them up on the carpet.  I started to
choke and spat them into my hand.  Fred couldn&rsquo;t chews them and
drooled them off the porch into the grass.  He said, &ldquo;Oh Well.&rdquo;  I
started cracking up more and spat them back into my hand and then
threw them as far as possible.  HA HA HA.  We were dying laughing.
Tears &amp; the whole works.  It must have been a location joke, though,
since you&rsquo;re not laughing.</p>
