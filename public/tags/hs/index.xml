Yesterday when I called Christina she was gone. When I called Charmain, she didn&#39;t want to do anything. so I rode around at the school. Today I went to church. Jessica, Cheri, and Emily were there. We talked about AIDS. Dad brought some rubbers there to show us them and teach us about &#34;safe sex.&#34; As if we don&#39;t know.</description>

I saw the Cougar Charms practice. Mmm, Mmm. Sweet pussy! 1:22 - It looks like no one can read this now...</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m going to quit writing down what I eat. It takes up to much room and doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much good. 1st Period - I wrote an outline for my research paper and I turned in a thesis statement. Miss Carter wrote it (thesis) though. 2nd we graded tests. Donald Martin graded mine. I got a 47 on it but he wrote it so it looked like a 97.</description>
