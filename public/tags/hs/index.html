<p>Yesterday when I called Christina she was gone.  When I called
Charmain, she didn't want to do anything.  so I rode around at the
school.  Today I went to church.  Jessica, Cheri, and Emily were
there. We talked about AIDS.  Dad brought some rubbers there to show
us them and teach us about "safe sex."  As if we don't know.  Actually
Emily didn't know much. I was surprised.  Afterward, Cheri, Jessie,
and I was in the office, talking and I told Cheri she ought to write
me a letter.  She asked why and I said because you write 'em to my mom
all the time.  She said why don't I write her one.  So, by May 1, I am
supposed to write her a 3 page letter.  She doesn't think I will do
it.  I'll show her.  Then Jessy wanted one so I am going to write her
2 pages.  And I will write 2 pages to Emily.  I also need to start on
my rought draft for English.  I also need to make a Solomon's Temple
for extra credit in History.  Well, that's my life up to this point.
ByeBye 3:25</p>

<p>1:20AM.  I finished 33 notecards out of 40 today.  I can do the
rest at school.  I wrote Lila a big long letter.  I did some extra
Spanish work.  I stayed after school and worked in Algebra and
Spanish.  I saw the Cougar Charms practice.  Mmm, Mmm. Sweet pussy!

<p>I&rsquo;m going to quit writing down what I eat.  It takes up to much room
and doesn&rsquo;t do much good.  1st Period - I wrote an outline for my
research paper and I turned in a thesis statement.  Miss Carter wrote
it (thesis) though.  2nd we graded tests.  Donald Martin graded mine.
I got a 47 on it but he wrote it so it looked like a 97.  That&rsquo;s
pretty neat I think.  I just hope Mrs. Roach doesn&rsquo;t notice.  3rd- (physics) we
took a test.  We got back a previous test.  I got a 94 on the previous
one.  Also on the previous one I solved the bonus and <em>no one</em>
else did.  We had to show that the earth receives 1/(2 billionth) of
the sun&rsquo;s energy&hellip; given the radius of the earth and the radius of
earth&rsquo;s orbit.  Pretty good!  4th. We turned in our extra credit
stories.  I stayed up &lsquo;till 2:30 last&hellip; nevermind it&rsquo;s already
recorded up there.  5th Nothin&rsquo; great 6th. Mr Reagh told us his theory
of how mathematics should be taught.  Kids should have no formal
schooling in math until 6th or 7th grade.  At that point they should
be given algebra.  Ultimately they would be 2 years ahead of
normal. 4:05</p></p>

<p>I had 2 bowls of Crispix for breakfast.  For lunch, I had a roll,
tea, and pizza and veggie sticks.  For a snack I had a piece of cake,
milk, slice of meat, and graham crackers.  1st pd.  Library.  I worked
on my paper more. 2nd I failed a test.  I have about a 50 in there.
3rd. We found out what is on our test tomorrow.  4th Oral grades.  I
got 18 out of 20. 5th Some jobs and a Timed Writing  6th.  Went over
test I got a progress report.  Today I found out that Christina's mom
is mad at her because we've only "been out" twice.  I swear her mom is
dumber than Christina.  It used to be that we were getting too
serious. What does she want??? Yesterday Christina gave me a matching
pen and pencil. They are nice, but the pen writes blue and the
pencil's lead is too big.  Today she gave me a list of 200 song
titles.  I don't know why.  I gave Charmain her "Beastie Boys" tape
back.  I borrowed it to copy it, but I didn't copy it. 4:15PM</p>
