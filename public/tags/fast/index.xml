      <description>07:55 Monday 02 September 2019 JST After having eaten extra ice cream and stuff late at night on the 31st, I fasted yesterday. Pretty easy, though I worked out at SOGO. Usually that would make me woozy if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t eaten, but yesterday seemed fine.
I have a bit of a headache now, which may be related to fast, or eat, or not enough water, or upcoming (first) session with Dean</description>

      <description>11:37 Tuesday 19 September 2017 JST Yeah so I ate too much yesterday and planned to fast today. But Letterman appeared and ripped the E from his sweater and Tariq took me to brunch after our lesson. I walked too close to my next lesson and was spotted so now I am at B where I will teach at 2pm, about to chow their scrumptious lunch. Oh, and all of this was after I discovered the lunch delivery was not cancelled yesterday for the holiday.</description>
