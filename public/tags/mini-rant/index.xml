Family holidays ruined by earliest Easter in 90 years
 It was felt that to celebrate Christ&amp;rsquo;s resurrection on the wrong day would be blasphemous so it was very important to get the day right. The general rule was agreed at the Council of Nicea in 325 AD.
 hahahahahahaaaha!!!
This cracks me up.Â The idea that God / Jesus / anyone-who&amp;rsquo;s-enlightened would be displeased/upset/blasphemised if a celebration were held at the wrong time.</description>
