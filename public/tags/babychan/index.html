<p>Lin and I replanted the sakura tree which we planted (too close to the
wall) last week.  There was a slight gap in the rain so we took the
chance to move the tree.</p>

<p>I was thankful I had done a careful job of packing mud and nutritious
leaves for the tree last week.  I was able to dig those up and reuse
them today.  To be honest I was a bit frustrated by the end and just
wanted to get it done, and then Lin bumped her head quite hard on the
window frame that extends out from the house.  (it sounded like a
heavy rock falling onto the ground).  I wanted her to stop working and
go inside, but she wanted to clean up the final bits of mud.</p>

<p>Most interesting about the whole thing was when Azuma-san came by and
said we didn&rsquo;t need to move it; the tree would have been fine 20cm
from the wall.  He showed us the tree near his wall as evidence.
Hmmm.  It&rsquo;s a different kind of tree, but fair enough.</p>

<p>Today Lin and I drove to Travis and Yumi&rsquo;s place to hang out with them
and Sakura.  Johan was already there and Deji came a bit later.  Nice
to see everyone again, though in some ways it&rsquo;s like the tribe is
getting smaller (and larger!)</p>

<p>No BBQ today due to rain, but we made 手巻き with chicken, eggs,
salad, and then ice cream at the end.</p>

<p>We laughed a lot, played with (funny) rubber balls, retrieved toys
from under the sofa set, and had a great time.</p>

<p>Peeps were ready to leave by the time I had to leave to get to men&rsquo;s
circle on time tonight, so Lin drove us to the station.  Driving a car
takes (unpredictably) longer than taking a train, so I took a train.</p>

<p>Deji and I sat on Yokohama line for a bit, talking about what racism
actually means.  He made a distinction between &ldquo;pre judging&rdquo; (making
predictions about someone) and &ldquo;prejuduce&rdquo; (assuming superiority over
someone).</p>

<p>After work today, Lin and I met at the station and as a little
&ldquo;romantic&rdquo; gift, I bought reserved seats so we could take Romance Car
to our station.  It was nice to just be able to relax all the way
home.  Curiously, when Lin tried to pay for my bus fare, it wouldn&rsquo;t
go through so the driver just let us on the bus free.  Yay!</p>

<p>I guess we should try to pay for each other&rsquo;s fare more often on the
bus, to help them get the bugs out of their system, and to get free
seats.</p>

<p>Okay it&rsquo;s been a couple days, but we had a lovely weekend in Shimoda.
So glad that Lin joined us!  She said she had a great time.  The
weekend schedule was kinda freestyle, which caused a bit of
consternation for some, but did not affect things too badly.  I
enjoyed getting to know everyone a bit better.</p>

<p>Yoga on Saturday morning was originally led by Lisa, but turned into
acro yoga with people being angels, superman, partners, flippers,
etc.</p>

weekend.  Rohini and I are in it!</p>

<p>Just got home via taxi with Lin after eating ice cream with her near
our station.  I got Ben and Jerry&rsquo;s cotton candy (which was similar to
Baskin Robbin&rsquo;s Popping Shower), and she got cherry by some other
premium brand, the name of which escapes me now.</p>

<p>Lin and I took the same train from Noborito to our station.  She had
gotten on near Shinjuku, and we did not specifically plan to take the
same train, but it worked out that way.  I was near the front and she
was near the back so we didn&rsquo;t see each other until we actually got up
to the concourse platform of our station.</p>

<p>She had been at work all day and I had just taken the Nambu Line from
Kawasaki to Noborito after taking Yamanote and K-T Line with Lisa,
after walking with Lisa and Jorge from Nishi Azabu to Shibuya (30
minutes or so) after our eighth 2 hour meeting (of eight).</p>

<p>I made it to the meeting a tiny bit more rushed than normal, but I
arrived on time after having visited Paola to receive my second <a href="https://www.bachcentre.com/centre/firstpag.htm">Bach
herbal remedies</a> bottle
from her.  Paola also fed me some rice she had made, plus a pear.  I
showed her the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KjsYc4Mb5g&amp;list=PL0osPGt21FB48UwuhtCUoi9JndC9YDHAZ">playlist of latest Marble Track 3</a>
and she subscribed!  I now have 3 subscribers yay!</p>

<p>Anyway, that was after I had teached in Nihonbashi, which was after I
added several exposures to the third snippet of Marble Track 3
videos.  Today I uploaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_arPJhJoIFM">drilled one hole</a>.</p>
