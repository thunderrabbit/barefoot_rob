<h2 id="10-27-saturday-05-august-2017-jst">10:27 Saturday 05 August 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Huge Japanese home next to parks &amp; hot springs
(<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17957650">https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17957650</a>) is probably ideal for couples,
but not big groups.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because we tried to do too much, or because Dr Wada was
overbooked, and did not keep to the originally planned schedule.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all very confusing, actually, but in short, I do not recommend
bringing big groups to this location.</p>

<p>(( About a week before the weekend, my co-coordinator tried to get a
group discount for having invited / brought so many (14+) people.
Renee said no to a discount, but offered to let me and co-coordinator
stay at no charge.  A few days before the weekend, after what I will
describe as bickering between Renee and my co-coordinator &reg;, Renee
told me she no longer wanted to deduct our fee for staying.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t say anything about it because (1) I thought Renee might
change her mind again (as she seemed to be talking in the heat of the
moment) and (2) before Renee had offered to let me and R stay for
free, I heard R say she was not doing it to try to make money. ))</p>

<p>Renee has recently (2017) bought this location; we were among her
first guests, and certainly her first big group.  The weekend plan
included two types of events (1):</p>

<p>*) seeing some of the sites around Takasaki
*) energy healing sessions with a Dr Wada, and with Renee, the host herself.</p>

<p>(1) <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aaZtimdAFAUc-RQhGsGKBpotwCue9aDBGBwju31K71g/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aaZtimdAFAUc-RQhGsGKBpotwCue9aDBGBwju31K71g/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>I arrived early by train and Renee picked me up at the train station.
We ate dinner at an indian place in the station.  On the way to the
house, Renee assured me that she did not need so many people to come.
Specifically, she could have made a lot more money by doing what she
normally does on the weekends.  But she was doing this for the good of
our group.</p>

<p>Dr Wada and his wife work as a healing team with Renee.  Renee told me
one of the reasons she bought the property was that it was close to Dr
Wada&rsquo;s home.  (Dr Wada&rsquo;s wife has ALS, and cannot move her legs or
lower back.)  Renee cried with joy a little when Dr Wada called to say
he had gotten his wife into the car.  Upon hearing the news that Dr
Wada&rsquo;s wife on her way, Renee told me something like &ldquo;this has always
been my dream to do healing sessions with them here.  thank you for
making this possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So great to hear; I hugged her and was glad to be part of a good thing.</p>

<p>Six healing energy sessions with Dr Wada were scheduled to last from
2pm to 5pm. They started an hour late (fair enough: in addition to
taking some time to get Dr Wada&rsquo;s wife to the house and up the stairs,
there was a minor medical emergency with Renee&rsquo;s son which needed to
be treated).  They should have ended an hour late, but that&rsquo;s where
things started getting weird.</p>

<p>Instead of each session lasting 30 minutes as scheduled, the first few
lasted 45 minutes.  Renee said something like &ldquo;nothing less than
miraculous healing is happening&rdquo; so I figured it was fine.  I did not
want to stand in the way of miracles.  (( but thinking about it, do
miracles take time to happen?  Why can&rsquo;t the healings happen in 30
minutes? Or maybe just get 30 minutes worth of treatment and leave
people wanting for more? ))</p>

<p>Originally scheduled for six people in 3 hours, Dr Wada treated 10
people in 10 hours.  Renee translated most of the sessions, so she was
unavailable to take us to the hot springs and dinner as was indicated
on the schedule.  Our group went to the hot springs on our own.  One
person covered up her tattoos to go into the onsen (after the staff
had talked to her the previous night about tattoos not being allowed).
The other person with a tattoo sleeve covering her arm did not go into
the onsen that night; I know because I walked back with her and
another participant to the house.  The other participant went back for
her treatment with Dr Wada.</p>

<p>The treatments with Dr Wada lasted until 1am (originally scheduled to
end at 5pm (or even 6pm to account for a late start)).  This threw the
whole schedule far off the next morning.  After helping Dr Wada&rsquo;s wife
get up the stairs at their house, I arrived back at Renee&rsquo;s house
around 2am, received an energy healing treatment from Renee (during
which she fell asleep, poor thing) and got to bed at 2:45am.</p>

<p>Let me be perfectly clear, there were some people who said the healing
treatment with Dr Wada was nothing short of amazing.  But the fact
that they took <em>much</em> longer than originally planned caused havoc the
next morning with our schedule and ultimately, with tempers.</p>

<p>After having been up late, Renee slept later than planned.  Our
smoothies and waffles for breakfast started around 10am instead of
ending at 9am as per the schedule.</p>

<p>Our group was anxious to get going on the tours as planned; some of
them needed to get trains back to Tokyo.</p>

<p>As people were milling about, wondering if we would have time to come
back to the house (or if we should pack everything into the cars to
head directly back to Tokyo), I repeated the question which people
were asking of Renee: should people pack everything?  and most
importantly, can we go now?</p>

<p>This is when things got really messy.  We hadn&rsquo;t sorted out the
payment because I had a problem with my credit card on Air BnB.</p>

<p>Though R suggested that we sort out the payment while we were out and
abount, Renee insisted that we do it &ldquo;now&rdquo; while people were waiting.</p>

<p>R noticed that she and I were being charged for the weekend, and I
realized I had erred by not telling her that Renee had decided not
reduce our rates.  We went over all the numbers, and now that I have
had time to reflect on it, I see some people were charged 1500 yen for
snacks and food, though snacks were included in the &ldquo;List of what is
provided by Mrs Gunma&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hPOAHKsGAHMCphKpLHj_5CzHvHDvFwdaOllQK1PKDCg/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hPOAHKsGAHMCphKpLHj_5CzHvHDvFwdaOllQK1PKDCg/edit</a></p>

<p>Though I no longer have access to the participant list on Google Docs,
we were charged for one participant for two nights, though she only
attended one night.</p>

<p>R wanted to hurry so agreed to just pay the money at that moment
instead of having some time to discuss.  We paid and went downstairs
where Renee proceeded to tell R to shut up so Renee could address
everyone with a sales pitch for her properties before having people
stand by the cars they would use to go home.  I just wanted to do
anything but be there.  I felt horrible for bringing people and for
not being able to speak up.</p>

<p>One of the participants put it very well.  Either go for healing
treatments or go to see Gunma.  Not both.  I will add not to go with a
big group.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rohini for inviting all the beautiful people who joined the
Gunma adventure staying at Renee&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p>Yesteray morning Lisa led yoga and later in the day she played an
instrument with four strings.  We tried doing some chanting with it,
but no one knew the chants.</p>

<p>We went to the caves apparently dug by hand with a bunch of different
statues (33?) different representations of the goddess of mercy or
something.  I mostly talked to Jill in there; we enjoyed wondering
what it would have been like back in the day to walk in some of the
places which now have barriers.  Some doors in the walls were unlocked
so we peered inside some dusty rooms, some of which had water in the
bottom.  Would be funny to get a photo inside, but too spooky to do
so.</p>

<p>So great to get healing treatment from Dr Wada and his wife Yoko who
can move her arms, but seems not able to talk nor move anything below
her shoulders.  Jorge reported he could feel Dr Wada&rsquo;s precise work; I
reported that my legs rotated toward the left while Dr Wada was
treating me, but nowhere near my physical body.</p>

<p>Talking about shungite, someone spouted some scientific hooha like
&ldquo;this mineral is from the edge of the universe&rdquo; and &ldquo;NASA has detected
this mineral on 67 different planets&rdquo;.. or something to that
effect.. I was like tf are you talking about.</p>

<p>During the treatments, Eucharia taught us something like group improv
games, which might be good in some classes with students who act shy
around each other.  If I ever teach in public schools, they will be
great for those classes.</p>

<p>We then played Zoom Zoom Zap, a game Rohini taught, and then did
variants with not showing our teeth (while saying thos words) and then
an animal noise variant, where the same noise kept it going and a new
noise reversed the direction.</p>

<p>I suggested the Seven Game (each person in circle says the next number
but numbers with 7 or multiples of 7 require a clap and reverse
direction) which we played until we got past 29.</p>

<p>At the onsen, Alison taught a game Don&rsquo;t Say Twenty where two people
take turns saying up to three consecutive numbers:</p>

<p>1 2, 3 4 5, 6 7, 8 9 10, 11 12 13, 14 15, 16 17 18, 19, 20 with the
person who says 20 being the loser.</p>

<p>I kinda know the rule, but Alison can still usually beat me.  Walked
back from the onsen with Alison and Jill, continuing the play the
Don&rsquo;t Say Twenty game.  I had told Jill briefly about Silent Football,
and was so happy to play Silent Football after the onsen last night
with Jill, Rokki, and Sandra!  We might might just might play again
sometime.</p>

<p>Last night ended up being late due to Dr Wada finishing so late; I
helped Yoko down the stairs at 1 AM and went with Mo to help Yoko up
the stairs at her house.  It was easy enough, and so easy to see how
much love they have for each other.</p>

<p>Renee fell asleep while finishing up a prayer treatment thing last
night, facing me and put her hands in prayer position while sitting on
the couch and after a while just slumped over and I was like ummm and
then she woke up.  Poor her, so tired after 10 hours of healing and
then the blessing of giving me a healing.  So nice, but I just do not
want to deal with the time just sliding away.</p>

<p>I lay down to sleep at 2:45am.</p>

<p>Will led a 20+ minute chant for about 15 of us in a room this morning
while waiting at 9am for 8am breakfast to be prepared.  It was shorter
than I felt like it could have been; I was just getting into it.</p>

<p>Late Dr Wada put us at late breakfast and way behind schedule so
tempers were up this morning as Rohini wanted to get as much time in
Gunma as possible and Renee wanted to count the money as diligently as
possible. I was so moe joe that I just wanted to gtfo and fuck the
extra 1000 yen that they miscounted in their favor.  They recounted
and I ended up not paying extra in that regard, but dang I just wanted
to run away.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m talking about how I cried after Renee told Rohini to shut up this
morning and I felt like we were being treated like little kids while
Renee goes &ldquo;the information is that I want to address everyone to find
out what I want to know before telling you what you want to know&rdquo;
which I understand she thought was related to the answer we wanted,
but was not.  Will saw me walk away from the group and he came to
offer a hug while I cried.</p>

<p>I did <em>not</em> smile for the picture in front of their house.  I just
closed my eyes and let my face feel sad because that is how I felt at
the moment.  Fuck fake documentation of photos. I felt like fucking
shit at the tail end of the weekend.</p>

<p>So happy to go swim in the lake!  I was invited to ride in the fun van
so I joined them and we stayed by the lake after two cars headed to
Haruna shrine.  So refreshing to just be like bbbllllaaahhhhhhhh and
splash into the water. Fun fun fun fun!!</p>

<p>Played Ceiling Wall Floor in the yellow van for a bit, using people&rsquo;s
names as fodder.  I used Jill&rsquo;s name a lot and she was it a lot.</p>

<p>Super thanks to Steve and Sophie for letting me ride with them; they
dropped me off at Takasaki station, and dropped off Fukiko somewhere
closer to her place.. Great to talk to him about slightly old school
communication technology SSL SLIP POTS..  not that I know details
about any of them, but I remember using them back in the day.</p>

<p>I wrote all the above while on the bullet train from Takasaki; we are
now arriving in Ueno.  Though I originally bought a ticket for Omiya,
I will go one more stop to Tokyo; according to Google Maps that is the
fastest way to go (well, fastest I can afford), and I should be home
by 9pm.</p>

<p>Lin was all set to buy Shungite from Renee, but we ended up with not
enough time to do so after going to Haruka lake and shrine.  The lake
was fine and the shrine was nice, but because we were late leaving
because of this extra trip, neither Lin nor I really took the time to
enjoy it. I did get a couple of pics, but nothing like wow holy shit
this was worth being late.</p>

<p>Once we got back to our car and on our way home, we had 1.25 hours to
travel what is turning out to be 3 hours, or exactly the amount of
time Lin intended to use to get home.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am not interested in being the manager of tours or any
variant of a tour guide.  Gonna have to pass on this one.  Montana
moment and all that.</p>

<h2 id="20-09-saturday-15-july-2017-jst">20:09 Saturday 15 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Turned out fine.  The AC guy said because they missed the problem the
first time, they would fix it for free, and we do not have to be there
to let them in because it&rsquo;s related to the outdoor unit.</p>

<p>I got a glimpse of some past life when Renee offered me diksha today
under the canopy of trees overlooking the base of Biyakue Dai Kannon.</p>

<p>Leaving in 2 hours.</p>

<p>Such a nice area!  We went to a long cave thing that was apparently
dug without modern equipment.  It is 400 meters long, and was
apparently supposed to go 400 meters more, but life and heavy rock got
in the way.  Really nice quiet energy there.</p>

<p>Visited a 41.8 meter tall statue which is 10 meters taller than
Corcovado in Rio.  So interesting because my memory of Corcovado is
that it was taller.  Like way taller.  Is it an illusion? Faulty
memory?</p>

<p>We went to the daruma shrine after going to a daruma shop where they
had hundreds of different daruma in a wide variety of sizes and
colors, including some branded with sports teams logos.</p>

<p>Francois has been featured in many many photos.</p>

<h2 id="01-47-saturday-01-july-2017-jst">01:47 Saturday 01 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Tonight on the Tokyo Bay cruise (1200 yen with Yukata) I met Renée who
has recently started a business called
<a href="https://www.mrsgunma.com/">MRS Gunma</a> in Gunma with her husband.
They have a romantic getaway house and an onsen nearby, plus they are
distributors for
<a href="https://www.mrsgunma.com/shungite-zero-spa">Shungite</a> a stone which
arrived on earth via meteorite back in the day in Russia, I think.</p>

<h2 id="23-03-tuesday-15-august-2017-jst">23:03 Tuesday 15 August 2017 JST</h2>

<p>For the record, I gave Renee 20,000 yen cash on the day I met her
because I was so inspired by her story.  She said she had wanted to
order some bags with her logo on them, so I gave the money as a pure
gift.  I chose not to write about it here because I hadn&rsquo;t given it to
get public kudos.</p>

<p>Now that she wants me to pay 21,000 more yen after I left a
<a href="/journal/2017/08/13/final-feedback-on-gunma-trip/">not-flattering review</a>
on Airbnb, I figure I will write (more) of the back story.</p>
