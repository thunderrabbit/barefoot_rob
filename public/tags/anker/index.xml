subject: pre-sales questions about Anker USB 3.0 9-Port Hub + 5V 2.1A Charging Port
Your hub at https://www.ianker.com/product/68ANHUB-B10A won lifehacker&#39;s poll (https://lifehacker.com/most-popular-usb-hub-anker-7-port-and-9-port-powered-u-1433052505), and you seem to have a lot of fans on Twitter, so I&#39;m about 10 minutes from making a purchase! BUT, I want to confirm that this product, will, in fact, solve my USB problems. I would like to connect multiple devices to my computer: * Apple USB keyboard * small elecom Mouse (daisy-chained to keyboard) * iPhone 4S (soon to be upgraded to Android something something) * Logicool USB camera * printer (with its own power supply) * iPad or some other tablet However, I cannot currently do so with a non-powered USB splitter.</description>
