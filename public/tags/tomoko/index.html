<p>Actually not lunch, but after the NWTA meeting, I worked on AB and
then hung out with Tomoko from 2:05pm to 2:50pm.  Midori was off
today, so I didn&rsquo;t get to see her.  We talked about badminton and
Mari-chan, who is in the badmintion group and happened to be with
Tomoko when she let me in.</p>

<p>Today (and most Thursdays) I taught at SCC in Kawasaki.  Naoko
reviewed for her test next week.  Yasu reviewed the same material for
his test sometime in the future.  Azusa did much better with her
fluency and intonation for her presentation.  Liliko asked about the
brochure that has to change soon to accomodate new opening times.</p>

<p>After the lessons I went to say HI to Tomoko and Midori, but Midori
had the day off.  Tomoko showed me how to RSVP on Circle Square for
next month&rsquo;s badminton game.</p>

<p>Lunched with Tomoko and Yukiko (first time to meet her) at SCC,
talking about movies and fears (acrophobia, claustrophobia,
arachnophobia) and then lesson with Midori, talking about spot AC
units which do not need ducts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on break now at JB, listening to the other class, where the
teacher&rsquo;s Japanesey English always kinda bugs me.  But the students
seem happy and have been in the class for a long time.</p>

<p>This morning thinking about C who apparently took my investment advice
before bitcoin blew up.  She quit her job and is overseas now.
hahahah nice!</p>

<p>Then working on AB, getting three alleged issues sorted.  Only one was
actually valid, but we had a chat on the phone and got them sorted.  I
fixed the one issue and then explained it to Kai who happened to come
by on her way to work.</p>

<p>Hi Kai!</p>

<p>Then went to SCC and talked to Tomoko and Midori for an hour each, not
counting lunch with Tomoko (Midori and Yuko chose not to join).</p>

<p>Zoom here to JB and two kids classes, the first of which went by
easily thanks to Patrick&rsquo;s (neverending) Day of Week game, and the
second of which went easily due to my shopping game.</p>

<p>Was barefoot between Sh and SCC.  Socks now, but will be barefoot on
the way home tonight.</p>

<p>Tomoko did well in our lessons in the SSC.  She had to give a
presentation in English today.  Midori does not have to present as
soon so she is trying to memorize more, it seems.</p>

<p>Lessons were after we ate lunch together on the 4th floor.  I still
kinda feel like an outsider there, as if my face and Visitor badge are
flashing beacons.</p>

<p>Today was the first of five 2-hour lessons this month at SCC.  Today I
helped Tomoko by making corrections to her written English.  She plans
to present the features of some of her company&rsquo;s products.  Pretty
cool stuff like elevators and batteries, and elevators that run on
batteries.  We studied up in their cafeteria on the 4th floor, and
then I went down the escalator to the third floor and went out the
exit I had never gone out before (but had seen many times).  Neat!</p>

<h2 id="the-next-day">the next day</h2>

<p>I discovered their wide screen TV wall is run via HDMI.</p>
