<p>Here is my QR code which apparently lets me through the immigration gate
in a breeze.  So nice that they have this service!  On my way out of
Narita, the lines to go through the human powered checkpoints were
quite long compared to the lack of lines in the automated gates.
Hmmm&hellip;  so I went over there and they helped me get registered free
of charge!  The QR code is good until the passport or visa expiration
date, whichever comes first.</p>

<p>I have been taking (but not really posting) pictures of the new train
line in Noborito station.  I guess it&rsquo;s part of the campaign Odakyu
has been announcing that they will reduce the congestion on the line,
and even decrease the time required to go to Shinjuku.</p>

<p>Anyway, they did something which surprised me: put down the rails,
locked them down, then <em>took them back up</em> before laying them down
again.</p>

<p>The second time, the rails were pre-welded together, so that&rsquo;s
something, but &hellip; why lay them down in the first place?  Could
someone have said &ldquo;Oh snap! We forgot to weld them!&rdquo; ???  I sincerely
doubt it.  Why would they put the rails down twice?  To make sure they
have enough?  To make sure they fit?  Seems like an expensive process;
rails are heavy!</p>

<p>Lin drove Ma and me to Lake Motosu.  Super great to have a perfect
break in the rainy weather on the way there and at the lake!  Now on
the way back, it is slightly foggy. (500m visibility)</p>

<p>Before laking, we ate next to four pugs whose owners had outfitted
them with vests with ice pouches on their chests.  While we ate,
several bicyclists arrived (after we had passed them on the road on
the way up).  I apologized for passing them, but I don&rsquo;t think they
understood.  (Lin said we had passed them, and I said sorry, so I
doubt they know what I meant.)</p>

<p>After lunch, we headed down to the lake and I was like, &ldquo;hmm I should
have brought shoes&rdquo; because the lava rocks were a bit tough underfoot.
We took a couple pics next to the lake and then we all squeezed into a
paddleboat with Ma steering as Lin and I paddled.  30 minutes was
enough of that for me!</p>

<p>The lake water was relatively clear, though there was one (1) big
gross diesel boat on the lake which seemed super disruptive
considering the number of paddleboaters, wind surfers, standing
surfers, swimmers, canoes, and other human powered vehicles on the
water.</p>

<p>We went back to the car and I was surprised Lin was ready to go; I
suggested we go sit among the trees, and was glad Lin and Ma agreed.
Ma went for a walk while I slept for a tiny bit.  Lin coordinated when
the guy will come to make sure they can put the AC in my room (either
Monday or Wednesday).</p>

<p>Now we are headed back!</p>

<p>While writing the above, I saw a lone hill from which paragliders
apparently launch, and then on the other side of the road, a
playground thing that I would enjoy playing on but wouldn&rsquo;t feel
comfortable climbing all over it like crazy while so many kids were
there.</p>

<p>Last night I realized I must have left my computer power supply in Ebisu.</p>

<p>Today I went to Yodobashi Camera and specified I wanted a power supply
for <em>this</em> computer (which they had on display).  Upon arrival at home
I discovered the power supply they gave me was not the power supply I
requested.</p>

<p>I immediately blamed the sales guy mother fucker frackin smackin waste
my time fricken asshole pendejo piece of s</p>

<p>you know; it&rsquo;s really not his fault.  Let&rsquo;s blame Apple for changing
power supply interface and not making it particularly easy to know
which power supply to buy for what computer.  They&rsquo;re both 85 watts.
Why not give them obvious model numbers or something?</p>

<p>Back to YC and was like,
[yeah so I requested the power supply for <em>this</em> computer and got the wrong power supply]
maybe something like, このパサコンのパワースップライを書きたかったけど、
これは違う。</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the same guy with whom I had transacted before, so he was
like [just a moment] and got the manager.</p>

<p>Manager was like, [yeah, but you opened it.]</p>

<p>I expected this.  For some reason it&rsquo;s really hard to return opened
electronics in Japan.</p>

<p>I was like, [yeah; I didn&rsquo;t know it was wrong until then.]</p>

<p>Anyway, a total of three times I waited, and twice he was like, &ldquo;yeah
but you opened it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was trying to figure out how to say &ldquo;how you gonna say that I should
know if it&rsquo;s right when your own sales guy didn&rsquo;t know it was right?&rdquo;
but fortunately it didn&rsquo;t come to that.</p>

<p>I explained that I had specifically requested the power supply for
<em>this</em> computer and even counted the contact-point bumps on the inside
and the other guy repeated the number (5) agreeing that it was fine.</p>

<p>He finally got the original sales guy and they sorted it out.  Yay!</p>

                        <p>##11:37am Sunday 2 November 2014##</p>

<p>Got off the train, felt no cellphone in my front pocket!</p>

<p>Crap!</p>

<p>I turned around and (stupidly) started <em>angling</em> back toward the train
door where we had gotten off, instead of straight back to the train
and got on before the doors closed.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;oh!</p>

<p>Went to the lost and found to report it.  I was like, &ldquo;so where does
that train stop?&rdquo; thinking they could look up that the train that left
at 11:37am and know when and where it was scheduled to stop for the
day (probably 大崎).  He was like, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a circle, mate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>True enough.</p>

<p>##13:00##</p>

<p>At Paola&rsquo;s house and called Softbank to ask them what to do.  The
rep was like, &ldquo;do you want us to track it?&rdquo;  Sure!  &ldquo;Okay, we&rsquo;ll call
you back in an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Great!</p>

<p>##14:00##</p>

<p>It took the better part of an hour, but Softbank called back and said
it&rsquo;s in Shinjuku Okubo 2 Chome, or around thereabouts.  I asked if the
phone is moving or if it&rsquo;s been stopped there for a while.</p>

<p>She was like, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know, but when we called it, it was in Shinjuku Okubo 2 Chome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(There goes my fantasy that they have giant maps with blinking lights
tracking phones around the city..)</p>

<p>So I go, &ldquo;okay, can you call it back and see if it&rsquo;s still there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We turned it off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any way to turn it back on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in Shinjuku Okubo 2 Chome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; ? Umm, okay thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>wut.</p>

<p>##14:14##</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to walk to the local police box to ask them to be on the lookout.</p>

<p>ELI5 why the fuck would Softbank turn it off?</p>

<p>&ldquo;so no one can make calls (can cost you a lot of money)&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just don&rsquo;t charge me for the calls after I report it lost.</p>

<p>##15:something##</p>

<p>The guy at the police box was 元気 (happy/funny/helpful) and was
confident I&rsquo;d get the phone back, though it might take some time.</p>

<p>##19:55##</p>

<p>After a lovely afternoon at Paola&rsquo;s, featuring home made Indian
cuisine, Lin and I <em>walked</em> to Shibuya station from Paola&rsquo;s house,
which took about 30 minutes, and brought us past Lin&rsquo;s old high school
and lots of other places she hadn&rsquo;t seen in several years.</p>

<p>Near 道玄坂 we saw some young men walking and brushing their teeth at
the same time.  Not sure what that was about, but I&rsquo;m sure it was
either funny or cool.</p>

<p>Lin and I hopped on Yamanote Line and I commented that it was also on
Yamanote platform in Shibuya that I lost Francois some years ago.</p>

<p>We skipped one train because it only stopped in 大崎.</p>

<p>We got on the next train, and Lin got a call just as we arrived in 大崎.
&ldquo;Did you lose a phone?&rdquo;, etc.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s in 新大久保, so we&rsquo;re headed back now.</p>

<p>Now, I put &ldquo;walked&rdquo; in italics above because if we had taken the train
to Shibuya, we would have probably already been walking toward home in
川崎 (you can read that, right, Colleen?) which would have made it
more moe joe to go pick up the phone tonight.  Even if we had gotten
onto a train all the way to 品川 when we skipped that one train, we
might have been &ldquo;too far&rdquo; away to go back tonight.</p>

                        <p>##6:20am Tuesday 4 March 2014 JST##</p>

<p>We moved!  Our new house is great, though a bit farther from the station.  However, that gives me a chance to take a walk each morning and evening.  I allocate 30 minutes walking time each direction.  Not sure how far it actually is, but probably around 2km.  2.6km according to Google.</p>

<p>The key words for this house are big and nice.  Oh, and cats (surrounding).</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t have internet connected yet, but have fiber installed in our living room!  Now my computer will be the bottleneck; that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to an electric shop looking for coaxial cable for the TV connection.  (sigh)   They only had 5m max (not nearly far enough to reach the station!!) but I needed 15 meters (routed at right angles along the edges of the room) to reach the spot where Lin wants the TV.  They said it would take a day at 9800 yen to make.  Ummmmm no thanks.</p>

<p>On the way home, I saw an <del>old guy</del> elderly gentleman in a shop that looked like my dad&rsquo;s garage.   I scoped the signs and could read enough to know he was a handyman.  I was like, &ldquo;hey, uh, do you happen to have coaxial TV cable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had to dig around a bit, but the short version is YES, he made 15 meters and gave it to me free.  whoooooo!!!!</p>
