<p>I missed SOGO 4 weeks in a row, and will miss it again next week, but
I enjoyed being back today!  Saw Kai while walking near Harajuku
station so got to say HI to her for a bit.  Super glad that she has
been enjoying the workout as well.  She met Tai while there, so they
enjoyed having rhyming names.</p>

<p>SOGO had their 1 year anniversary party on Saturday night at Womb.  It
was my first time to go to that club and I was worried it would be all
smokey and gross, but perhaps because it was a private party and SOGO
peeps are ostensibly into health and fitness, no one smoked; yay!</p>

<p>Everyone commented that I was wearing shoes for once, but I kicked
them off as the music started bumping after some fun team-bonding SOGO
style exercise activities.  Who can do 25 pushups the fastest?  Who
can do the most pushups in 30 seconds (with a cup balancing on lower
back).</p>

<p>Anyway, great time dancing with Nav, Mike, Rikke (sp), Gurleen (sp)
(who made great eye contact) and the party ended too soon for me to be
tired (3.5 hours) so I encourged Mike and co-workers to walk to
Roppongi.  Only 45 minutes, but the co-workers went barefoot!!  Wow!
We played The Jackie Purdy Game for a bit, and Mike presented some
logic puzzles about prisoners in hats.  I got the first one pretty
quickly</p>

<p>spoiler alert:</p>

<p>but took a bit longer for the second.</p>

<p>And Gurlene (sp) suggested there is an even <em>easier</em> way to solve it!</p>

<p>Great time at SOGO today, though I was surprised to find out that Mike
is moving back to the US!  Oh my gosh I had just enjoyed personalized
training with him last week!  His support of SOGO was celebrated with
the support of the group lofting him into the air.  Spontaneous chaos</p>

<p>For the last part of today&rsquo;s workout, Mike led us in some Mike style
exercises, which were way over my skillz, including lots of kickboxing
punches and kicks.  I danced for part of it, while Emi filmed the
group.</p>

<p>Then we had a 2-minute burpee challenge.  In the challenge, women were
allowed skip the pushup part, and everyone counted their own burpees.
I did 18 in two minutes.  A couple guys did 40+!!  Two of the women
did 50!  They had a 20 second burpee-off to see who would win the
prize of 2000 yen.</p>

<p>There was another 2000 yen prize to the person who brought the most
guests, and then I won 2000 yen for being &ldquo;genkiest&rdquo; since I workout
barefoot each time!  Super thanks to Oliver for nominating me.</p>

<p>Going to SOGO today; I hope it&rsquo;s not too cold!!</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ll take shoes just in case.</p>

<h2 id="14-33-sunday-08-january-2017-jst">14:33 Sunday 08 January 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Just connected with Kai at Sun&rsquo;s Out Guns Out in Yoyogi Park. I wore
shoes on the way there but took the off when I arrived.</p>

<p>Kai is the first person I invited to join more than once.</p>

<p>Lin was like &ldquo;nope!&rdquo; after she went one time.</p>

<h2 id="11-32-tuesday-10-january-2017-jst">11:32 Tuesday 10 January 2017 JST</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m still sore after SOGO.  In Menya&rsquo;s group, we worked on quads via
squats and jumps.  In Michael&rsquo;s group, I got to &ldquo;spar&rdquo; with Michael
(in slow motion!) as we practiced blocking punches and kicks.  It was
quite fun, and I really got to see Michael&rsquo;s love for teaching that
day.</p>

<p>But for now, both (the acts of) sitting down and standing up are
painful.</p>

<p>Lin and I hung out at home instead of going to Suns Out Guns Out.
Partially because it was cold and partially because I wanted to
resolve bickering about how we should go visit Mikako.  (drive vs bus
vs train)</p>

<p>Lin wants to drive but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very safe, especially if
there&rsquo;s snow.</p>

<p>Yesterday I joined <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/sogotko">SOGO</a> for their late start after Halloween partying
the night before!  I chatted with Emi who said she had <em>not</em> been
partying; in fact had been working the previous night.  Her company
does mobile payments, apparently using an app instead of hardware like
square.  Seems like more trouble for the end user, but maybe I&rsquo;m
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>The workout was fun; I&rsquo;m sorta kinda getting better strength and
endurance.  Mike was a bit puffed (thanks Jennie J for that word!),
which is unusual (exept after party night!)</p>

<p>I joined the &ldquo;advanced / super advanced / Menya&rdquo; group, whereas I had
joined the &ldquo;beginner / intermediate&rdquo; group before.  Wasn&rsquo;t too hard;
I&rsquo;ll stick with that plan from now on.</p>

<p>Yay!  Lin joined us at SOGO yesterday in Yoyogi Park.  She met Eri who
was also a first timer and hung out with her.  I&rsquo;m glad they enjoyed
it.</p>

<p>The workout was a bit tougher than others, but still fun!  I&rsquo;m glad we
weren&rsquo;t asked to do the pair mountain-climbers that Mike is so fond
of.  Man.</p>

<p>Sunday was my first time to join <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/sogotko">Suns Out Guns Out</a> for their weekly
workout in Yoyogi.  We did about 90 minutes of exercises and then ate
lunch (took a long time because of crowds on the street for a parade)
and then played ultimate frisbee for some hours.  Great fun!</p>

<p>Yesterday I was super-crazy sore, but today I&rsquo;m just sore, so
hopefully tomorrow no worries.</p>

<p>Had sooo much fun; everyone was super friendly!  I&rsquo;m looking forward
to attending again!  This coming Sunday Lin and I are going to Saitama
for her friend&rsquo;s BBQ, but the next Sunday I will go to SOGO again and
Lin said she would join!</p>
