<p>(written 21:42 Wednesday 13 June 2018 JST)</p>

<p>This past weekend after SOGO (only like 12 people attended because it
was sprinkling for part of the time) we went to Cookie Time, and oh my
god I can imagine how bad it is for me because of how good they
taste.  I will probably go back next week, esp if Aki comes to SOGO;
she also loves sweets.</p>

<p>I ate mine before most people even started theirs; I hadn&rsquo;t heard we
were going to wait for a compai and picture haha.  Some people could
not finish theirs so I helped them out.  Man I must be a sugar junkie.</p>

<p>Hung out in the park afterward, chatting and drawing designs in the
pine needles.  Ended up leaving after a solid hour because the rain
began in earnest.  Walked back to Cookie Time to get my umbrella,
which was helpful to have once I got back to Shin Yurigaoka.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s friend Aki joined SOGO today and had a lot of fun!  Lin may
attend as well next week; Aki plans to go again.  Yay!</p>

<p>I got a bit sunburned, but should not be too bad tomorrow.</p>

<p>SOGO is 2 years old today, so the organizers suggested a picnic in
Yoyogi after the workout.  Great workout and picnic with maybe 100
peeps and 80 peeps in attendance, respectively.  I chatted with Hide,
who has come for quite a while, and some first timers, Kino, Anna, and
Laurie.  Actually I don&rsquo;t know if it was Kino&rsquo;s first time, but it was
my first time to meet her.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m typing now, I think I might have sprained my thumb.  While
walking earlier, I could definitely feel a strain in my ankle.  Good
times.</p>

<p>Great fun at SOGO today and not too hot, but a bit tiring.  It&rsquo;s
apparently Alisha&rsquo;s last day.  Chatted with Thanuja at the Mexican
restaurant for lunch; 12 SOGO peeps at our table.  Leo and Lydia
reminded me about geocaching.</p>

<ol>
<li>I started a Meetup group
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ManKind-Project-Tokyo/">ManKind Project Tokyo</a>
which will soon be linked to the Mankind Project Pro Meetup
account.</li>
<li>Men&rsquo;s group meetings are now every Tuesday (since March).  We had
been meeting twice a month since about August 2015.  The group has
slowly grown and now twice a month is not enough for every man to
do his work.</li>
<li>SOGO is still going, although the leadership is changing.  Menya
was not there today; Maha will soon be moving to Ireland; Michael
left for California last year.  Good job Pinakesh and Sho for
leading the group today!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has a grand total of nearly 9 minutes of video.  As
of this moment, the stage is spinning 4 units per frame (pretty
fast) and some characters are affected, but ghostable gluer is not
affected.</li>
<li>I work for JB primarily (Wednesdays and Thursdays in Kawasaki +
Akihabara) Solid Square early Wednesday mornings, from which Chika
has moved on; SCC Wednesday / Thursday afternoons, both for museum
and showspace; JB head office on Wednesday afternoon+evenings for
kids classes alongside Patrick, and adult lessons alongside Matt;
then GG lesson in Akihabara on Thursdays.</li>
<li>After GG on Thursdays I head home for Japanese lesson with Mel in
Chicago, who has free time after getting her son off to school on
their Thursday morning.</li>
<li>Secondarily working for ist with Tariq, with lessons on Monday
mornings.  We had a lot of students up to the end of the year last
year, but they pretty much bounced during the holidays.</li>
<li>Also working for ist on ConSwi, a new game we are developing
<em>slowly</em> but surely with <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot 3</a>.  I am
scheduled to meet Tariq this afternoon in 武蔵小杉 station.</li>
<li>Also working for Tess, with one lesson per week on Mondays around
noon.  Not sure if that will be continued after the next two
lessons coming up in April.</li>
<li>Also working on growing the men&rsquo;s group and hope to figure out a
way to bring enough value to businesses that I can make some money
with it.  For now it is all volunteer.</li>
<li>And volunteering a couple times a month on
<a href="https://www.7cups.com/">7 Cups</a>, etc.</li>
<li>I just received in the mail
<em>Sacred Circles</em> by Robin Deen Carnes and Sally Craig,
<em>The Gifts of Imperfection</em> by Brené Brown, and
<em>Planet on Purpose</em> by Brandon Peele.</li>
<li>Fred got his PhD! in December (I think).  He&rsquo;s teaching C++
courses.</li>
<li>Lin and I have our cat Jennie and live in our house near (ahem, 24
minutes walk from) 新百合ヶ丘 station.</li>
<li>I recently bought a Crayon Shinchan book, and a Doraemon book, but
they are kinda beyond my understanding, unless I go slowly.</li>
<li>I am still using my last ever Macbook Pro.</li>
<li>I got rid of my iPhone and now use a waterproof Android phone,
(which was waterproof before any iPhones were waterproof.)</li>
<li>running out of steam in this SOML.</li>
<li>Oh, I have been using <a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a> to get stuff done.  It is
thanks to Complice that I remembered I need to write an SOML today.</li>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Easter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;?????&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;April Fools!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally got back to SOGO today and it was touch!  Camelia (sp) saw me
and was like, &ldquo;remember me??&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;I remember your <em>face</em>&ldquo;
(could be an insult, but wasn&rsquo;t in this case), and she reminded me she
had volunteered for <a href="https://peaceboat.org/">Peace Boat</a> since I last
saw her.  So neat to hear that it&rsquo;s growing but still has the same
genki energy as before.  She said in 2020 they are going to have a new
eco-friendly ship!</p>

<p>Went to SOGO for workout with about 50 people in attendance.  Great
weather and great workout.  I met Shell, Koji, Tyler, and others, but
cannot remember now.</p>

<p>Went to lunch with Lisa at Laska and chatted with her a bit, and got
to see a video of the type of dancing she is doing.</p>

<p>Went down to Tsujido for karaoke after recording video at karaoke with
Kai, Mitsue, and Soness as the stars.  Got to see long-time-no-see
Yuji, and longer-time-no-see Jesse.  Plus got to meet all-time-no-see
Vesna.  Thanks to Soness for organizing and inviting, and giving me
some crazy sock-shoes!</p>

<p>Came back for lesson with Sarumama but got her cancellation request on
my way home.  She said she will pay for the lesson.</p>

<p>Walking toward home, I saw the guy next to the telescope stand I
sometimes see with or without a telescope.  This time he had his
telescope connected to a laptop which could see the image.  Much
easier to use than back in the day when we had to squat down and
squint up into the eyepiece.  He showed me a picture he had taken of a
nebula, which was apparently 120 snapshots overlaid on each other to
get sufficient brightness.  It looked quite good for such a small
telescope!  (3 inches or so)</p>

<p>I was late to SOGO because I was late leaving and forgot my phone so
had to come back.</p>

<p>I was a bit late arriving, but they were late starting so it all
worked out.  Haha we worked out as well.  My toe injury did not bleed
and was basically fine, though now it&rsquo;s dirty.  I was puffed by the
group workout at the end, running while piggybacking Naoki, but even more
impressive was him running while piggybacking me.</p>

<p>Went to lunch with Zach, Naoki, Ai, and Asuka at the mexican
restaurant where the SOGO group has been going recently.  Hella closer
than the other Mexican place, but fewer lunch options.</p>

<p>Glad I got my phone so Tariq and I could coordinate meeting after
SOGO.</p>

<p>went to workout with SOGO today in Yoyogi park.  So hot!  But still
fun, though at times I felt kinda close to passing out.</p>

<p>Lin and Ma joined me on the way to SOGO.  They watched from a bench
across from the tree where SOGO peeps generally meet.  Workout was
great fun, though a bit hard since I haven&rsquo;t attended in a while.
Unfortunately I won&rsquo;t be able to attend for two months starting in
October.  I&rsquo;m bummed about that, but work is work.</p>
