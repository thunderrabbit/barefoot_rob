<p>One rule of journaling is to keep it present.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t written about Christine&rsquo;s party not Rin&rsquo;s workshop, but</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m headed to SOGO!  We are apparently meeting in a new location today. I guess there is some kind of festival covering our normal area.
I am super glad I checked, and even more glad Ruri posted the change!</p>

<hr />

<p>Yesterday at the Tokyo Tribe monthly vision planning workshop, we met in B1 of the building from last month.</p>

<p>Sophie, Rin, Hiro, and I attended, and I jokingly said &ldquo;remember back in 2019 when it was just 4 of us at the meeting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We talked about the viability of larger groups.</p>

<p>Next meeting has been scheduled for a Friday, taking into consideration my Eye Gazing workshop on September 28th!  So thankful and like &ldquo;wow! Is my little workshop really so important?&rdquo; (tears-welling-emoji)</p>

<p>9:58am just arrived at meijijingumae for SOGO!</p>

<h5 id="12-48-sunday-01-september-2019-jst">12:48 Sunday 01 September 2019 JST</h5>

<p>It&rsquo;s not scorching hot like a couple of weeks ago, but still pretty warm.</p>

<p>Today there were lots of new people, and some people I hadn&rsquo;t seen for a while.</p>

<p>Met Mon and Sumin, remet Kinue, Lam, and Mayumi.  Emi wasn&rsquo;t there, but Ruri, Hide, and Moise led.</p>

<p>Anuj confirmed he will attend Past Lives workshop, and Alex seemed interested.  Yay!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired, falling asleep on the train.</p>

<p>Fun in the sun today at SOGO Bootcamp.  We had to adjust our normal
workout area due to puddles, but all good and lots of fun.  I remet
Anuj, Valeria, Lisa, Alex, Ben.  Got to see Haruo and Jim again as
they led ultimate frisbee after bootcamp.</p>

<p>We played until about 1:18pm with about 6 on 6 down to 4 on 4 as
people had to go.</p>

<p>There is a morning exercise routine used by Japan to help build
community and health and prepare everyone for the day.  Even though it
has been used in Japan for a minute, it has not spread outside Japan.</p>

<p>Today after SOGO, Menya and Risa led us through the first stages of
changing all that.  They had multiple cameras and awesome music.
Video is coming Wednesday.</p>

<p>(written Monday 2pm)</p>

<p>SOGO was a lot easier for me this weekend probably because it was not
so blasting hot as it&rsquo;s been during the summer.  I was basically able
to do most of the exercises without giving up partway through as I
have done in the past.</p>

<p>After the workout, I joined a small group for lunch at a Thai
restaurant.  At my table: Asaad, Kino, Alex, Rafaela, Tatsuya, and
maybe someone else.</p>

<p>While heading back to Yoyogi Park, I was entertained that Rafaela saw
Dominique and someone going shopping so she was like, &ldquo;bye!&rdquo; to us and
bounced.</p>

<p>Back in Yoyogi, Masa was with Yo-T (sp), Leo, Pierre (?), and a couple
others doing some kinda game with jenga blocks.  Stacking the blocks
on people as a human sculpture.  Several different movement games
including Hand Dance While God Attacks, Animal Flow 3D, and the
finale: Dodge String.  We should have a video of that up soon; Masa
said he wants to edit the video before posting.</p>

<p>After that I headed deeper into Yoyogi Park to find Michael and Yuka&rsquo;s
party with lots of people, food, drinks, bubbles, and games.  I got to
meet Yuka&rsquo;s grandmother Hiroko, who could sit in 正座 like a champ.</p>

<p>Talked to Asaad more about his work in transportation engineering
(physics of bridges, tunnels, embankments, etc) and about men&rsquo;s
circle, including <a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/themenswork/">The Men&rsquo;s Work</a></p>

<p>SOGO was cancelled today due to a typhoon (that was also apparently
cancelled).</p>

<p>I used the cancellation as an excuse not to go because I am supposed
to attend a presentation right after SOGO and need to be clean for it.</p>

<p>Well, I do not <em>need</em> to be clean, but I imagine I will fit in better
if my bare feet are not covered in mud.</p>

<p>Man, I shoulda gone to SOGO.</p>

<p>Instead, I got my budget caught up, oh, and I typed the long-ass
Japanese community news thing.  And took a nap.</p>

<p>Long time no see for Mike, and not-so-long no see for Brad, but I had
to ask their names again.  Re-met Haruna as well; will remember all
three in two weeks when I go back to SOGO!  Today Chihomi came and
said she enjoyed it enough to come back.  Today was also Kevin&rsquo;s first
day.  Kevin, beard freshly levin.</p>

<p>No SOGO today due to rain.</p>

<p>I hope Mark got the message; I met him on the train yesterday and
invited him to join.</p>

<p>So what to do today?</p>

<p>Plan:</p>

<ol>
<li>write in Japanese</li>
<li>work on MT3</li>
<li>fix <a href="https://robnugen.com/geocaching">https://robnugen.com/geocaching</a> to refresh to <a href="https://new.robnugen.com/geocaching">https://new.robnugen.com/geocaching</a></li>

<p>Went to SOGO with everyone and then Cookie Time with Aki, but the line
was too long for her so we bounced. Said bye to her at the station and
then went back for cookies!  Bought a shake, but it was more like
blended milk than blended ice cream.  Bought a lemon cookie for Lin
and headed home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh I forgot my water bottle&rdquo; so I headed back to the park and saw
Menya and them leaving the park.  They had my water bottle yay!</p>

<p>Went to lunch at TGIF and ate chicken quesadilla (fast service this
time) across from Ami, next to whom I sat last time we were there (my
first time at SOGO, circa two years ago).  (I had been across from
Emi, but Lisa came and sat by Menya so we all shoved down one seat.)</p>

<p>Headed home and found Lin at the station where we bought KFC and ate
it outside in the yard while mosquitoes feasted as well.</p>

<p>Now sleepy nap time for me before lesson with Sarumama at 8pm and then meeting with
Tariq at 10pm.</p>
