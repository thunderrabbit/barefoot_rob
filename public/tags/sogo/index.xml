      <description>One rule of journaling is to keep it present.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t written about Christine&amp;rsquo;s party not Rin&amp;rsquo;s workshop, but
I&amp;rsquo;m headed to SOGO! We are apparently meeting in a new location today. I guess there is some kind of festival covering our normal area. I am super glad I checked, and even more glad Ruri posted the change!
Yesterday at the Tokyo Tribe monthly vision planning workshop, we met in B1 of the building from last month.</description>

      <description>14:14 Sunday 16 June 2019 JST Fun in the sun today at SOGO Bootcamp. We had to adjust our normal workout area due to puddles, but all good and lots of fun. I remet Anuj, Valeria, Lisa, Alex, Ben. Got to see Haruo and Jim again as they led ultimate frisbee after bootcamp.
We played until about 1:18pm with about 6 on 6 down to 4 on 4 as people had to go.</description>

      <description>06:19 Monday 12 November 2018 JST There is a morning exercise routine used by Japan to help build community and health and prepare everyone for the day. Even though it has been used in Japan for a minute, it has not spread outside Japan.
Today after SOGO, Menya and Risa led us through the first stages of changing all that. They had multiple cameras and awesome music. Video is coming Wednesday.</description>

      <description>19:03 Sunday 14 October 2018 JST (written Monday 2pm)
SOGO was a lot easier for me this weekend probably because it was not so blasting hot as it&amp;rsquo;s been during the summer. I was basically able to do most of the exercises without giving up partway through as I have done in the past.
After the workout, I joined a small group for lunch at a Thai restaurant. At my table: Asaad, Kino, Alex, Rafaela, Tatsuya, and maybe someone else.</description>

      <description>11:39 Sunday 30 September 2018 JST SOGO was cancelled today due to a typhoon (that was also apparently cancelled).
I used the cancellation as an excuse not to go because I am supposed to attend a presentation right after SOGO and need to be clean for it.
Well, I do not need to be clean, but I imagine I will fit in better if my bare feet are not covered in mud.</description>

      <description>13:34 Sunday 23 September 2018 JST Long time no see for Mike, and not-so-long no see for Brad, but I had to ask their names again. Re-met Haruna as well; will remember all three in two weeks when I go back to SOGO! Today Chihomi came and said she enjoyed it enough to come back. Today was also Kevin&amp;rsquo;s first day. Kevin, beard freshly levin.</description>

      <description> 10:08 Sunday 24 June 2018 JST No SOGO today due to rain.
I hope Mark got the message; I met him on the train yesterday and invited him to join.
So what to do today?
Plan:
 write in Japanese work on MT3 fix https://robnugen.com/geocaching to refresh to https://new.robnugen.com/geocaching  </description>

      <description>19:03 Sunday 17 June 2018 JST Went to SOGO with everyone and then Cookie Time with Aki, but the line was too long for her so we bounced. Said bye to her at the station and then went back for cookies! Bought a shake, but it was more like blended milk than blended ice cream. Bought a lemon cookie for Lin and headed home.
&amp;ldquo;Oh I forgot my water bottle&amp;rdquo; so I headed back to the park and saw Menya and them leaving the park.</description>

      <description>Sunday 10 June 2018 (written 21:42 Wednesday 13 June 2018 JST)
This past weekend after SOGO (only like 12 people attended because it was sprinkling for part of the time) we went to Cookie Time, and oh my god I can imagine how bad it is for me because of how good they taste. I will probably go back next week, esp if Aki comes to SOGO; she also loves sweets.</description>

I got a bit sunburned, but should not be too bad tomorrow.</description>

      <description>20:01 Sunday 22 April 2018 JST SOGO is 2 years old today, so the organizers suggested a picnic in Yoyogi after the workout. Great workout and picnic with maybe 100 peeps and 80 peeps in attendance, respectively. I chatted with Hide, who has come for quite a while, and some first timers, Kino, Anna, and Laurie. Actually I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was Kino&amp;rsquo;s first time, but it was my first time to meet her.</description>

      <description>15:18 Sunday 08 April 2018 JST Great fun at SOGO today and not too hot, but a bit tiring. It&amp;rsquo;s apparently Alisha&amp;rsquo;s last day. Chatted with Thanuja at the Mexican restaurant for lunch; 12 SOGO peeps at our table. Leo and Lydia reminded me about geocaching.</description>

      <description>15:25 Sunday 01 April 2018 JST  I started a Meetup group ManKind Project Tokyo which will soon be linked to the Mankind Project Pro Meetup account. Men&amp;rsquo;s group meetings are now every Tuesday (since March). We had been meeting twice a month since about August 2015. The group has slowly grown and now twice a month is not enough for every man to do his work. SOGO is still going, although the leadership is changing.</description>

      <description>14:44 Sunday 01 April 2018 JST &amp;ldquo;Happy Easter!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not Easter!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;rdquo;?????&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;April Fools!&amp;rdquo;
Finally got back to SOGO today and it was touch! Camelia (sp) saw me and was like, &amp;ldquo;remember me??&amp;rdquo; and I was like, &amp;ldquo;I remember your face&amp;ldquo; (could be an insult, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t in this case), and she reminded me she had volunteered for Peace Boat since I last saw her. So neat to hear that it&amp;rsquo;s growing but still has the same genki energy as before.</description>

      <description>20:56 Sunday 04 March 2018 JST Went to SOGO for workout with about 50 people in attendance. Great weather and great workout. I met Shell, Koji, Tyler, and others, but cannot remember now.
Went to lunch with Lisa at Laska and chatted with her a bit, and got to see a video of the type of dancing she is doing.
Went down to Tsujido for karaoke after recording video at karaoke with Kai, Mitsue, and Soness as the stars.</description>

      <description>14:28 Sunday 18 February 2018 JST I was late to SOGO because I was late leaving and forgot my phone so had to come back.
I was a bit late arriving, but they were late starting so it all worked out. Haha we worked out as well. My toe injury did not bleed and was basically fine, though now it&amp;rsquo;s dirty. I was puffed by the group workout at the end, running while piggybacking Naoki, but even more impressive was him running while piggybacking me.</description>

      <description>13:12 Sunday 13 August 2017 JST Lin and Ma joined me on the way to SOGO. They watched from a bench across from the tree where SOGO peeps generally meet. Workout was great fun, though a bit hard since I haven&amp;rsquo;t attended in a while. Unfortunately I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to attend for two months starting in October. I&amp;rsquo;m bummed about that, but work is work.</description>

      <description>17:08 Sunday 23 July 2017 JST I missed SOGO 4 weeks in a row, and will miss it again next week, but I enjoyed being back today! Saw Kai while walking near Harajuku station so got to say HI to her for a bit. Super glad that she has been enjoying the workout as well. She met Tai while there, so they enjoyed having rhyming names.</description>

      <description>18:50 Monday 08 May 2017 JST SOGO had their 1 year anniversary party on Saturday night at Womb. It was my first time to go to that club and I was worried it would be all smokey and gross, but perhaps because it was a private party and SOGO peeps are ostensibly into health and fitness, no one smoked; yay!
Everyone commented that I was wearing shoes for once, but I kicked them off as the music started bumping after some fun team-bonding SOGO style exercise activities.</description>

      <description>16:07 Sunday 15 January 2017 JST Great time at SOGO today, though I was surprised to find out that Mike is moving back to the US! Oh my gosh I had just enjoyed personalized training with him last week! His support of SOGO was celebrated with the support of the group lofting him into the air. Spontaneous chaos
For the last part of today&amp;rsquo;s workout, Mike led us in some Mike style exercises, which were way over my skillz, including lots of kickboxing punches and kicks.</description>

I think I&amp;rsquo;ll take shoes just in case.
14:33 Sunday 08 January 2017 JST Just connected with Kai at Sun&amp;rsquo;s Out Guns Out in Yoyogi Park. I wore shoes on the way there but took the off when I arrived.
Kai is the first person I invited to join more than once.
Lin was like &amp;ldquo;nope!</description>

      <description>17:31 Monday 28 November 2016 JST Lin and I hung out at home instead of going to Suns Out Guns Out. Partially because it was cold and partially because I wanted to resolve bickering about how we should go visit Mikako. (drive vs bus vs train)
Lin wants to drive but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s very safe, especially if there&amp;rsquo;s snow.</description>

      <description>written 07:49 Monday 31 October 2016 JST Yesterday I joined SOGO for their late start after Halloween partying the night before! I chatted with Emi who said she had not been partying; in fact had been working the previous night. Her company does mobile payments, apparently using an app instead of hardware like square. Seems like more trouble for the end user, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;m misunderstanding.
The workout was fun; I&amp;rsquo;m sorta kinda getting better strength and endurance.</description>

      <description>12:24 Monday 24 October 2016 JST Yay! Lin joined us at SOGO yesterday in Yoyogi Park. She met Eri who was also a first timer and hung out with her. I&amp;rsquo;m glad they enjoyed it.
The workout was a bit tougher than others, but still fun! I&amp;rsquo;m glad we weren&amp;rsquo;t asked to do the pair mountain-climbers that Mike is so fond of. Man.</description>

      <description>12:10 Tuesday 30 August 2016 JST Sunday was my first time to join Suns Out Guns Out for their weekly workout in Yoyogi. We did about 90 minutes of exercises and then ate lunch (took a long time because of crowds on the street for a parade) and then played ultimate frisbee for some hours. Great fun!
Yesterday I was super-crazy sore, but today I&amp;rsquo;m just sore, so hopefully tomorrow no worries.</description>
