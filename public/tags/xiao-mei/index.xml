      <description>19:51 Thursday 11 July 2019 JST Today there were only 1.5 students in my Akihabara class. This number is down from our high of like 8 last year when I had to stop checking homework during the lesson because there ended up being no time for class. I guess there would be time with just 2 students&amp;rsquo; worth of homework.
Anyway, the lesson kinda devolved into a China vs Japan debate.</description>
