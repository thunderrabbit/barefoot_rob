<p>A man has two lives.  The second one begins when he realized he only
has one life.</p>

<p>My second life has begun.  I am feeling the fire in my gut, mixed with
the fear of rejection and failure.  But as I have learned through
experience, if I follow my fear I will be headed in the right
direction in life.</p>

<p>For me these fears result in me dying alone.  There is a process
called What&rsquo;s at Risk which I learned from Mankind Project.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at risk if I do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People might not like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if they do not like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will not like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if they do not like you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if they leave you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will eventually die alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once we get to the bottom, we start over with the other option as a
starting point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at risk if I don&rsquo;t do it?&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will lead a pointless life&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you lead a pointless life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have no enthusiasm&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you have no enthusiasm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have no connection to friends&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you have no connection to friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will die alone&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have been through this chain of broken logic countless times.  In my
case, when I follow the what&rsquo;s at risk line of questions, I always end up dying alone.</p>

<p>I believe the point of the exercise is to point out the logical
fallacy.  Somewehre there is a mis-step in logic.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try it again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People might not like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk if people might not like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will adjust it and try again&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aha!  That was quick.  Because my excitement is merged in with the
fear, coming from a core <em>knowing</em> that this is the right way to go.
Or at least the right ballpark or sport.</p>

<p>That knowing is there that I will not just give up.  I will keep
coming back at it from different angles until I get it right.  I just
have to hope I won&rsquo;t be like a mosquito trying to go through a screen
window.</p>

<hr />

<p>So what is the vision?  The vision is to make Emotional Intelligence
as important as that other kind of Intelligence, just plain old
intellect.  The vision is that I can stand listening to someone yell
at me when I fuck up my visa.  &ldquo;You have to leave Japan today!&rdquo; big
man was yelling at me, and I was aware of the fear inside my body, but
did not get pushed around by it.  I could feel it swirling.  &ldquo;I had
fucked up.  My life was ruined.&rdquo;  But I also know fear is an emotion.
It is energy in motion.  Fear is that feeling that comes up when I do
not have enough information to make a decision about the future.  I
want to stay in the country; I am listening to a man yell at me,
saying that I cannot.  I stood there calmly listening.</p>

<p>He paused for second.  &ldquo;Do you understand what I am saying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I assured him I did and reiterated the sailent points.  He agreed that
I got it, but the points pointed to one main point.  I had to leave.</p>

<p>So I punted.  &ldquo;I am planning to get married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had popped the question to Lin a month or so prior to this event.
During that month she kept asking if I had gotten my visa sorted.  &ldquo;I
still have time; the postcard says to do it by July 18th&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turns out, that date didn&rsquo;t matter.  It was the date actually <em>in my
passport</em> that mattered.</p>

<p>To be Continued &hellip;.</p>
