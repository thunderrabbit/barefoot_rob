      <description>18:18 Saturday 15 June 2019 JST Lin and I replanted the sakura tree which we planted (too close to the wall) last week. There was a slight gap in the rain so we took the chance to move the tree.
I was thankful I had done a careful job of packing mud and nutritious leaves for the tree last week. I was able to dig those up and reuse them today.</description>

      <description>Goodnight, Tree
Monday 31 August 1998
Tonight when I got home from I-group, I noticed the tree at the corner of the parking lot had, um.. let&#39;s say, done an impression of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Its branches were brushing the ground, making a virtual jungle where I normally park Scott. So I parked Scottie on the street and checked out the situation. Turns out the power lines were holding the tree up from falling all the way over.</description>
