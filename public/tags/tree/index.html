<p>Lin and I replanted the sakura tree which we planted (too close to the
wall) last week.  There was a slight gap in the rain so we took the
chance to move the tree.</p>

<p>I was thankful I had done a careful job of packing mud and nutritious
leaves for the tree last week.  I was able to dig those up and reuse
them today.  To be honest I was a bit frustrated by the end and just
wanted to get it done, and then Lin bumped her head quite hard on the
window frame that extends out from the house.  (it sounded like a
heavy rock falling onto the ground).  I wanted her to stop working and
go inside, but she wanted to clean up the final bits of mud.</p>

<p>Most interesting about the whole thing was when Azuma-san came by and
said we didn&rsquo;t need to move it; the tree would have been fine 20cm
from the wall.  He showed us the tree near his wall as evidence.
Hmmm.  It&rsquo;s a different kind of tree, but fair enough.</p>

<p class=date>Monday 31 August 1998</p>

<p>Tonight when I got home from I-group, I noticed the tree at the corner of the parking lot had, um.. let's say, done an impression of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  Its branches were brushing the ground, making a virtual jungle where I normally park Scott.

<p>So I parked Scottie on the street and checked out the situation. 

<p>Turns out the power lines were holding the tree up from falling all the way over. The very short shallow roots had just lifted right out of the ground on one side and that was it!

<p>I greatly thank my angels for such an easy tree removal process.  No cars were crunched, the apartment building was not smushed, and the only thing that had to be repaired was my phone line.

<p>The parking lot is pretty small, so even the staircase in the back of the building was a virtual jungle of branches.  I climbed up the steps like an old Aztec pyramid in the jungle.

<p>I called my landlord who called the light company and they came out at 11pm.  They looked at the tree. "This is too big for us; we'll have to call a tree crew."

<p><pre>(The "Tree Crew" ?  I've never heard of them.)</pre>

<p>I went to bed, and gave thanks in advance for waking up gently as soon as the crew got here.  I wanted to take pictures!

<p>I woke up, didn't hear anything, so went back to sleep and then "whoah!" I heard chain saws!  So I grabbed my camera and zipped outside, down through the jungle and took pictures.

<p>I actually went crazy and took an entire roll; we'll see how they turn out, and I expect to scan them onto my site soon.</p>
