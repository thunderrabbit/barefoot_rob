      <description>07:05 Wednesday 04 April 2018 JST This morning I woke up with a start in Noborito, where I transfer between lines from Odakyu main line to JR Nambu line.
&amp;ldquo;Oh snap my stop!&amp;rdquo; and bounced out of my seat, got off the train and was confused about how far down the platform I was.
&amp;ldquo;Where am I? This is&amp;hellip; ohhhh&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and went back in the train and sat back down in my seat.</description>

Ack! It&amp;rsquo;s late!
&amp;ldquo;Today&amp;rdquo; 9am at Maggie and John&amp;rsquo;s new house to help them move. Munched breakfast of fruit and donuts before we headed out for the storage unit. (During the time they&amp;rsquo;ve been &amp;ldquo;between houses&amp;rdquo;, living with Molly and Will, most of their junk has been in a storage shed thing.)
Three loads and 4.5 hours later, and the stuff was all at the house.</description>
