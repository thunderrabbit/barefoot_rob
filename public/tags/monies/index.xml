      <description>12:59 Wednesday 02 November 2016 JST I was told that Western Union could send money directly to my bank account. It&amp;rsquo;s a new service they offer.
Except when I tried to send money to my bank account in the US, I was told I&amp;rsquo;d have to go to the US to get it.
Ahem.
I bitched at them and they changed the recipient, but still, smells like false advertising or crappy internal communication (&amp;ldquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t have that service, sir&amp;rdquo;) or something.</description>
