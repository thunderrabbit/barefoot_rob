Two years ago I decided I would make a meditation time for iOS so I could inspire myself to meditate daily. It took ten days (according to git) and had all the features I needed: set the desired countdown time, count down, then count up after the time had finished!
That way, if I was having a good meditation, I could keep going and know how long I continued!</description>
