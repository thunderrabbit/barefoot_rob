      <description>When out and about, I like to allow plenty of time between clients so I can be relaxed while in transit. Today I took it a step (ha) further by walking quite slowly.
After slowing myself down physically, I noticed a sense of peace come over me. An awareness of joyful awareness like a tautology of being happy because you&amp;rsquo;re happy.
Time lost its meaning as I simply walked step by step, aware of the surroundings like being there for the first time.</description>

      <description>14:19 Thursday 29 September 2016 JST Wow. I just walked an hour today and my legs are like &amp;ldquo;hey man, cut it out,&amp;rdquo; so it appears Travis&amp;rsquo; wise idea is a good idea as well. Take a practice walk before walking 8 hours a day for 9 days.</description>
