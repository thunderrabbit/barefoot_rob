      <description>20:01 Sunday 22 April 2018 JST SOGO is 2 years old today, so the organizers suggested a picnic in Yoyogi after the workout. Great workout and picnic with maybe 100 peeps and 80 peeps in attendance, respectively. I chatted with Hide, who has come for quite a while, and some first timers, Kino, Anna, and Laurie. Actually I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was Kino&amp;rsquo;s first time, but it was my first time to meet her.</description>
