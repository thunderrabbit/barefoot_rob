                        <p>(adapted from my note last night to Mark)</p>

<p>I went to a stand-up comedy open mic tonight and ended up doing a set
(my first ever!)</p>

<p>Several jokes went well, a couple did not; one of those is not
recoverable in any way I can think of.</p>

<p>Soness said it was really good that I used contents of the room for
several of my bits.</p>

<p>I have been taking Soness&rsquo;s Step On The Red Dot course, part of
<a href="https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/">https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/</a></p>

<p>Today was a normal marathon session of getting stuff done, plus lots
of witty anecdotes which I hope are helpful for everyone.</p>

<p>I had to bounce out of the Zoom session after 4.3 hours or so and
recorded my second Facebook Live video.</p>

<ul>
<li>What elements do you think make this a “quintessential” talk?</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure what you mean by the talk being quintessential; I think it&rsquo;s
inspired and probably true, but it is not <em>better</em> than other talks on TED.</p>

<ul>
<li>What’s your opinion on this talk?</li>
</ul>

<p>Great to see a &ldquo;famous&rdquo; artist be humble and real about her fears and
modeling how she intends to continue doing her work because it&rsquo;s her work.</p>

<ul>
<li>How would you summarize this talk in a sentence?</li>
</ul>

<p>I take care of the quantity, God takes care of the quality.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you think this idea was chosen as an idea worth spreading?</li>
</ul>

<p>We need more creative solutions in the world.</p>

<ul>
<li>Had you seen this talk before? If so, what effect has it had on you?</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep on swimming.</p>

<ul>
<li>What action can you take after watching this talk?</li>
</ul>

<p>Be glad I am doing my creative work as well.

<p>He presented problems to students who created solutions at least for
collecting data in the case of nuclear stuff.</p>

<ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s passionate, off the cuff, well planned, freestyle, approachable,
attractive</p>

<p>A bit unpolished, but quite inspiring.</p>

today, before the class starts?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really a <em>speaking</em> engagement, but come on out to Bar

<h2 id="10-30-friday-20-april-2018-jst">10:30 Friday 20 April 2018 JST</h2>

<p>Several meetings today, including with men&rsquo;s group and Soness and
others.</p>

<h2 id="13-33-friday-20-april-2018-jst">13:33 Friday 20 April 2018 JST</h2>

<p>So far so good!  Good feedback from attendees and should be meeting
with Soness soon.  Wanna ask her how to prepare for Toastmasters
meeting tonight.</p>

<p><em>Bio</em></p>

<p>Walking on stage, you immediately notice something .. off.  Rob is
barefoot!  Was it a mistake?  Did he lose his shoes?  Turns out he has
gone barefoot as much as possible for 15 years.</p>

<p>He talks about authentic speaking, being vulnerable with others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult sometimes, but it&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo;  Is he talking about
going barefoot or talking about being vulnerable?</p>

<p>Then you realize he is talking about emotional honesty in a men&rsquo;s
circle.  &ldquo;What is a men&rsquo;s circle?&rdquo; you wonder.  &ldquo;Some kind of club?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After founding Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Group, Rob started a group for women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The methods work,&rdquo; he says.  &ldquo;I know from experience my relationship
with my wife has improved.  My relationship with everyone has
improved, by looking inside at the dark corners of myself&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is he even talking about?&rdquo; you wonder, but he looks excited,
saying something about lowering the suicide rate in Japan.</p>

<p>Pretty lofty vision, but could it work?  Could speaking about problems
really help them?</p>

<p>You settle in for the talk, and soon find yourself wondering at the
possibilities.  What would it be like to have a mission in life?  What
would it be like to have support in completing my mission?</p>

<p>After all the speakers, you head home, but still can&rsquo;t stop wondering
about that barefoot guy.  What was his name again?  You get out the
bio sheet and read.</p>

<p>Rob is American living in Tokyo. He walks around barefoot as an
example to let people be themselves and not worry about what others
may think.  Starting personal growth work in 1997, he is now the
representative in Japan for The Mankind Project (mkp.org), founding
and leading two peer counseling circles here.</p>

<p>He listens patiently, allowing his clients time to feel and be present
in the moment.  He models being vulnerable and imperfect.  &ldquo;The key to
happiness is letting myself be me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sketched out this speech a few days ago as I decided to switch my
<a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a> Goal 0 from &ldquo;Take Counseling Course Online&rdquo; to &ldquo;Speak on stage
in Tokyo&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>What is your mission in life?

What is it that drives you, that inspires you to wake up each day,
knowing what you plan to do, knowing it might not work out that
way TODAY, but knowing that on the whole, you are driving toward
something.

I'm not talking about goals daily goals weekly goals 5 year plan
10 year plan. I'm talking about my mission for me it's that
unattainable optimal Target in life that's concrete but elusive.

Maybe concrete is not the right word. It's succinct. it's easy for
me to do a litmus test to determine if any particular action is
assigned with what I ultimately want to be known for in life. Is
this moving me closer toward my target Mission or not?

What is your mission in life?

What do you ultimately want to be known for in life. What do you
want to be on your epitaph?

Yes I mean that message on your head stone when you die. This is
life out death stuff. what will you create with your life?

It's my LinkedIn profile title. Half of my mission is my
title. That gives me some flexibility for how to implement my
mission.

For me it's my kids. I want to raise them into productive adults
who have self driven self created missions in life. And to be
clear, I don't mean my biological children. It's too late for
that. Unless we have a Surprise. I'm ready now, I think. Okay I'm
readiER.

I can remember asking my dad when he would be a granddad. I was
perhaps seven years old. At that time, I didn't know I had
anything to do with that decision.

In any case, my mission is something that is, truthfully,
unattainable.  LIke a shining star on the horizon, pointing me in
the direction I want to have traveled when I look back on my life.

Having a mission gives me some core material to discuss when it's
my turn to speak in men's circle.  I may start by stating my mission:

I create a safe and empowered world by listening and sharing my heart.

Then the simple question guides me.  In what parts of my life do I
not listen nor share my heart?   Oh man, talk about pulling out
the stops!  Well, I sigh, for example &quot;sometimes I do not listen
to my wife.&quot;

And this can start a whole experiential connection to deep
emotions which are, ultimately, keeping me from being on mission.

<p>Went to SOGO for workout with about 50 people in attendance.  Great
weather and great workout.  I met Shell, Koji, Tyler, and others, but
cannot remember now.</p>

<p>Went to lunch with Lisa at Laska and chatted with her a bit, and got
to see a video of the type of dancing she is doing.</p>

<p>Went down to Tsujido for karaoke after recording video at karaoke with
Kai, Mitsue, and Soness as the stars.  Got to see long-time-no-see
Yuji, and longer-time-no-see Jesse.  Plus got to meet all-time-no-see
Vesna.  Thanks to Soness for organizing and inviting, and giving me
some crazy sock-shoes!</p>

<p>Came back for lesson with Sarumama but got her cancellation request on
my way home.  She said she will pay for the lesson.</p>

<p>Walking toward home, I saw the guy next to the telescope stand I
sometimes see with or without a telescope.  This time he had his
telescope connected to a laptop which could see the image.  Much
easier to use than back in the day when we had to squat down and
squint up into the eyepiece.  He showed me a picture he had taken of a
nebula, which was apparently 120 snapshots overlaid on each other to
get sufficient brightness.  It looked quite good for such a small
telescope!  (3 inches or so)</p>

<p>Build Your Speaker Bio is Soness&rsquo;s most recent course.  It solves the
problem of having something to give to TEDx organizers when they ask
for a speaker bio which they can use in marketing materials.</p>

<p>Prior to starting this course I did not see myself as a speaker, so
why should I write a bio?  I still cannot honestly say I see myself as
having something worth <em>speaking</em> about, but I can see huge value in
the course.  We are writing bios that really connect to the essence of
our selves and our messages.  Getting down into all the good parts of
me that I do not feel comfortable showing to the world.</p>

<p>Maybe I can be a speaker!</p>

her sites keep getting hacked.  blarg.  I will try moving the sites to
new user&hellip;.  hmm maybe I&rsquo;ll just start from a fresh Wordpress installation.</p>

<p>Yay lunch at a nice south indian restaurant!</p>

<p>We worked on Soness&rsquo;s sites some, so saw a bit of progress.  Called
her friend Ay who is also web savvy to try to work out solutions to
script problems.</p>
