      <description>Hide and Akiko from 7pm class each needed to make up some lessons, so stayed for the 8pm class featuring Misato and Tatsuya.
I think it worked pretty well; they had not met each other, and they are all pretty much similar personalities so I figured they would get along fine.
After self intros, most of the time they talked about Akiko&amp;rsquo;s challenging business trip to Hydrabad, India. Most of the rest of the time we talked about Hide&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>

      <description>21:17 Wednesday 08 May 2019 JST I felt really happy to hear Misato with her eyes wide, say &amp;ldquo;a dreamcatcher!&amp;rdquo;
Seems like it was a good choice.</description>

      <description>22:11 Wednesday 27 February 2019 JST So surprised when Misato gave me and Lin matching tiger eye bracelets today! I had commented on Misato&amp;rsquo;s bracelet last week (and apparently praised it too much!) cause it caught my eye, and I had never seen dark tiger eye before. Super striking!
I guess this means I should buy her something kinda special from my trip.
I probably should have gotten a picture of our matching bracelets.</description>
