      <description>(actually written 13:53 Wednesday 24 July 2019 JST)
Though my phone conked out overnight without being charged, I was able to get one picture with these guys
 before I knew I would love them before I knew I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wear shoes in the park  ( image coming soon )
They came out to greet the incoming guests as the park opened, and I got a picture with them because this guy was on a 2 meter tall unicycle!</description>
