                        <p>My TV says if I buy this or that toothpaste / car / ______ then I will be happy.  What TV doesn&rsquo;t tell me is that happiness is temporary.  Instead of buying my way into temporary happiness, I can sit my way into lasting happiness.</p>

<p>Sitting allows me to reset my brain to my center, my spirit, my essence.  This is where permanent happiness resides.  In this moment, sitting in what I call the Ever Present Present, I can just be, happily.</p>

<p>It has taken me a long time to reach this point, but from
<a href="/journal/1997/11/15/new-warrior-training">being afraid of men</a> in
1997, I am now facilitating deep emotional work in men&rsquo;s circles every
week, both online and face to face in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I want to deepen my skills as a facilitator and have decided to step
more fully into this emotional awareness work.  To improve my facilitation
skills, I plan to staff two (2)
<a href="https://nwta.mkp.org">New Warrior Training Adventure</a> weekends, back
to back in March and April.  (full disclosure, I will also attend the
MKP Face to Face Gathering in March, but I do not completely know what
that will include.)</p>

<p>To this end, Jeremy was like, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you put together a Gofundme
page to help raise money for the trip?&rdquo;  Wow great idea!  Then Michael
was like, &ldquo;the trip is just the starting point; let&rsquo;s start Mankind
Project Japan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He worked out a bare bones budget for 2019, but it is still beyond
what I have ever thought about.  Life changing work.</p>

<p class=date>5:36am CST Friday 25 February 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t sleep after I wrote the previous message..  not out of
astonishing giddiness, but more of a nagging things-to-do-list.  I
remembered I still had to research online brokerages for our
investment club meeting this Saturday!</p>

<p><p>Since the meeting is tomorrow, I figured I oughta get the research
out of the way ahead of time.  Instead of doing full blown tons of
info research, I looked for basics: minimum balance, cost per trade,
can we fund the account with cash or checks?, can we write checks from
the account?</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m leaning towards <a href="https://www.waterhouse.com">TD
Waterhouse</a>.  They have checkwriting, initial balance of only
$1000, $12 per trade, and local office in the Galleria area.</p>

<p><p>Plus, I already have an account there.  The club and I will both
get free trades if I refer the club to Waterhouse.  I will tell the
group upfront about this added bonus; even without it, I think they&rsquo;re
the best option we have!</p>

<p><p>Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Card A said it might take 2 weeks to make the balance transfers, but I called them tonight anyway to see what was up.  Turns out that neither one was processed; it would have put me over my credit limit.  Doh.  I think a finance charge was applied to Card A and the balance transfers would have therefore put me over my limit.  They were carefully measured to put me right exactly at my limit.</p>

<p><p>So I asked the guy if I could make a balance transfer.  He reminded me that the current balance that I carry would stay at the higher interest rate of 13.15% until I pay off the balance transfer.</p>

<p><p>Fair enough.  So I believe I will transfer Card A balance to Card C and then back to Card A.  He said that would be no problem.</p>

<p><p>Called Card C and they said they didn&rsquo;t do balance transfers.  Hmf.   So I&rsquo;m going to now call Card D.</p>

<p><p>Called Card D and the woman said no problem and they will pay $640.09 to Card A within 3 to 5 days.  &ldquo;To be safe,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we have to say that. It will probably be more like 1 or 2 days.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So as soon as that goes through, I&rsquo;ll have Card A pay Card D for the entire Card D balance, effectively moving the balance from 12.99% to 4.9% interest.</p>

<p><p>Nice!</p>

<p><p>In other news, I&rsquo;m going to play Ultimate tonight and Kristen is coming to watch.</p>

<p><p>Then tomorrow Kristen, Farrah and I are going to Galveston.  Yay!</p>
