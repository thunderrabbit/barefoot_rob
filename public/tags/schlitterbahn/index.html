<p><p class=note>(transcribed out of my diary)</p>
<p>
Wende and I are in New Braunfels at her parents&rsquo; house.  We went to Schlitterbahn today&ndash;my first time there&ndash;and had a ton of fun.  There are 3 separate parks.
<p>
I was most technologically impressed with the water coaster.  The water pressure accelerated the tube boats up up up so they could slide down then up then down and the key was (of all things) large holes in the bottom of the up ramps which let out the water that was no longer going up so that it wouldn&rsquo;t slow the boat.<br>
Torrents of water fell splashing all over the ground, usually where people could walk &amp; get drenched.
<p>
Second most technologically impresive was the Boogie Bahn, a surfing wave thing with water shootin&rsquo; down into a large trough and then back up and out/over the other side.  I did it twice, much much much better the second time when I stayed surfin&rsquo; (on my tummy on the board) for about a full minute. Very cool.  But we did not bring a camera.
<p>
I really enjoyed circling around a perpetual water circle cycle / wave pool thing.  Went around it about 6 times.  I treaded water for 105 wave cycles in a small wave pool.  I enjoyed the exertion.
<p>
My favorite ride at the first section of Schlitterbahn wound its way through the trees and down down all around and then bububububububububububububub fast down to the end.
<p>
I zipped down a body slide chute and down one that required a board or something like that.  The only thing I did not find was a slide or thing or anything that had blinding white knuckle incredible speed.  Closest was the surf thing and exertion at the wave pool. No speed but exertion.
