(transcribed out of my diary)
 Wende and I are in New Braunfels at her parents&amp;rsquo; house. We went to Schlitterbahn today&amp;ndash;my first time there&amp;ndash;and had a ton of fun. There are 3 separate parks.  I was most technologically impressed with the water coaster. The water pressure accelerated the tube boats up up up so they could slide down then up then down and the key was (of all things) large holes in the bottom of the up ramps which let out the water that was no longer going up so that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t slow the boat.</description>
