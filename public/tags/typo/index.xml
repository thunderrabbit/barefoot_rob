      <description>10:59 Friday 16 February 2018 JST I cannot decide if I should care that my accountants apparently cannot spell or cannot hire proofreaders or what. Does it make a difference? Should I complain? Stop using them? Is this just a case of English language changing?
I mean language is a tool to transmit meaning between people and written language is a tool to transmit meaning across time as well. I know what they mean, but could there be a case where it&amp;rsquo;s not clear?</description>

I saw a crappy transcription of a screenshot apparently taken from the Sony hack. It&amp;rsquo;s even more amazing after they implied they had kept the errors intact:
