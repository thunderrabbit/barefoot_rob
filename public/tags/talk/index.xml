      <description>23:14 Wednesday 10 April 2019 JST I tried ;join /urbit-talk
I then followed this tweet ;join ~dopzod/urbit-help
But when I type in the talk&amp;gt; field, I do not see my posts anywhere.
Later I saw

      <description>16:03 Monday 22 October 2018 JST I chatted with Dora for 1.75 hours on the phone. She had some amazing insights on my presentation for MKP stuff. Plus a course she has enjoyed taking, designed to help people start their business projects.
While talking, I walked from Nishi-Azabu to the other end of Yoyogi Park before realizing I had intended to turn right before Yoyogi Park, or actually maybe even turn at Omotesando.</description>
