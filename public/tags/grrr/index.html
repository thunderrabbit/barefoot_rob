<p>So much to be happy for! Great weather, great wife, happy bare feet,
holiday, seats on the train, going to see Travis and Yumi, at Kids&rsquo;
Country no less!</p>

<p>Lin has been indoctrinated to not let the cat outside, so Jennie is
going a bit stir crazy, peeing on Mama&rsquo;s futon (twice) and now it&rsquo;s
being tossed in the trash ($100 wasted) despite my please to spend
$100 to have it cleaned by a cat-pee-centric cleaning place.  Because
of Lin&rsquo;s indoctrination, her mom is indoctrinated to not let Jennie
out so on our way out as Jennie is <em>begging</em> to go out, I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;we
should let her out; will your mom be here today?&rdquo; so Lin asked her mom
if she&rsquo;ll just open the door for the cat but her mom is like ohh it&rsquo;s
better if you guys are here because her mom doesn&rsquo;t want to feel
responsible in case any of the things that could possibly happen to
Jennie (get a disease, win the lottery) happen.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m glad at least Lin was open to the idea and says we can let
Jennie out tomorrow.  Yay!</p>

<p>So we left and got on the bus (freezing cold with AC grr why waste
energy) and then I realized that the phone in my pocket is my camera,
not my phone. dammit.  I left my phone at home.</p>

<p>At least I have my camera (and Francois).</p>

<p>Fortunately we made our train connection ギリギリ, and we have seats
together.  So I&rsquo;ll stop being grouchy and just say fuckit to my phone
and have a good day.</p>

<p>D is an idiot.  Why am I so short tempered with him?  How can he
be so old and so dumb all at once?  how does this serve me to be
pissed at his ineptness?</p>

<p>I am just trying to get some work done around here and he's fucking
around with the phone system that we've had for over a year and he
still can't figure it out.  And I'm not talking about how to set up a
conference call with someone or how to transfer someone to voice mail,
not that those are hard to do, but I'm talking about fucking hanging
up the fucking phone.  The speakerphone in this case.  How can he not
know how to use and hang up the speakerphone?  Oh and when he was
paged, he said hello and they couldn't hear him so the instant obvious
no-fucking-shit solution is to click the mic button.  And then to hang
up, click the hangup button.</p>

<p>fuck!</p>

<p>Why am I so worked up about this?</p>
