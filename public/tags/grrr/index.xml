      <description>10:03 Monday 04 May 2015 JST So much to be happy for! Great weather, great wife, happy bare feet, holiday, seats on the train, going to see Travis and Yumi, at Kids&amp;rsquo; Country no less!
Lin has been indoctrinated to not let the cat outside, so Jennie is going a bit stir crazy, peeing on Mama&amp;rsquo;s futon (twice) and now it&amp;rsquo;s being tossed in the trash ($100 wasted) despite my please to spend $100 to have it cleaned by a cat-pee-centric cleaning place.</description>

D is an idiot. Why am I so short tempered with him? How can he be so old and so dumb all at once? how does this serve me to be pissed at his ineptness?
I am just trying to get some work done around here and he&#39;s fucking around with the phone system that we&#39;ve had for over a year and he still can&#39;t figure it out.</description>
