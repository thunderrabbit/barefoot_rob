After I said / hinted to Fred that I&amp;rsquo;d love to play Minecraft with him on a world that I&amp;rsquo;ve been tweaking for months over the past couple years, he said he knew what he wanted for Christmas.
So today, I did a big step towards buying Minecraft for Fred: update my beneficiary bank account in the US with GoLloyds GoRemit.
That way I can pay off my credit card (most of which was due to my having bought a follower on Twitter), so I can feel less dumb about charging MC to my MC.</description>

Lin asked me tonight if I planned to buy the gift she wanted for Christmas.

Don&amp;rsquo;t tell Lin, but I ordered it two days ago. I didn&amp;rsquo;t tell her tonight because that&amp;rsquo;s not much of a Christmas surprise if I tell her now! It was a bit difficult not to tell her, but I was able to convince her that I planned not to buy it with responses like, &amp;ldquo;what are ya gonna do with it anyway, but just put it on the shelf?</description>
