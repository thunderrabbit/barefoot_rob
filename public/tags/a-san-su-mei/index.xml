      <description>21:53 Sunday 15 October 2017 JST A-san-su treated us to dinner after we went to Machida with him and a-san-su-mei. Lin wanted to drive, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t mind until we got close to the station and tried to park. Man we coulda saved a lot of time by taking the train.
Anyway, they found no souvenirs in Machida area, but got some near our station. The we ate at our favorite buffet restaurant and talked about eating less, esp at night, and eating better, esp in the morning.</description>
