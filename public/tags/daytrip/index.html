<p>Lin drove Ma and me to Lake Motosu.  Super great to have a perfect
break in the rainy weather on the way there and at the lake!  Now on
the way back, it is slightly foggy. (500m visibility)</p>

<p>Before laking, we ate next to four pugs whose owners had outfitted
them with vests with ice pouches on their chests.  While we ate,
several bicyclists arrived (after we had passed them on the road on
the way up).  I apologized for passing them, but I don&rsquo;t think they
understood.  (Lin said we had passed them, and I said sorry, so I
doubt they know what I meant.)</p>

<p>After lunch, we headed down to the lake and I was like, &ldquo;hmm I should
have brought shoes&rdquo; because the lava rocks were a bit tough underfoot.
We took a couple pics next to the lake and then we all squeezed into a
paddleboat with Ma steering as Lin and I paddled.  30 minutes was
enough of that for me!</p>

<p>The lake water was relatively clear, though there was one (1) big
gross diesel boat on the lake which seemed super disruptive
considering the number of paddleboaters, wind surfers, standing
surfers, swimmers, canoes, and other human powered vehicles on the
water.</p>

<p>We went back to the car and I was surprised Lin was ready to go; I
suggested we go sit among the trees, and was glad Lin and Ma agreed.
Ma went for a walk while I slept for a tiny bit.  Lin coordinated when
the guy will come to make sure they can put the AC in my room (either
Monday or Wednesday).</p>

<p>Now we are headed back!</p>

<p>While writing the above, I saw a lone hill from which paragliders
apparently launch, and then on the other side of the road, a
playground thing that I would enjoy playing on but wouldn&rsquo;t feel
comfortable climbing all over it like crazy while so many kids were
there.</p>
