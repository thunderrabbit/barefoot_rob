On Sunday night, Manda picked me up from the airport. I told her about the whole weekend and totally fell asleep with the understanding that I would see her on Monday at Project Heart.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t talk to her all day Monday, which was okay; she&amp;rsquo;s got school and I had 71 email messages and website stuff with Dude, but she didn&amp;rsquo;t show up to Project Heart.</description>

Today started last night for me. Manda came over and we talked and chilled and she had brought some Japanese crab burritos or something like that: Crab, celery, rice, all rolled into a burrito shape with seaweed as the wrapper. Good stuff. She ate them mostly with soy sauce, I ate them mostly plain. Then she showed me the green stuff that came with the meal.</description>
