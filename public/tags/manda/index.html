<p><p>On Sunday night, Manda picked me up from the airport. I told her about the whole weekend and totally fell asleep with the understanding that I would see her on Monday at Project Heart.</p>

<p><p>I didn&rsquo;t talk to her all day Monday, which was okay; she&rsquo;s got school and I had 71 email messages and website stuff with Dude, but she didn&rsquo;t show up to Project Heart.</p>

<p><p>Hmmm.  I called her afterward and left messages on her cell phone and home phone.</p>

<p><p>That night I talked to Brandie and converted pennies into susan b anthony dollars.</p>

<p><p>Now Tuesday is well underway and I still haven&rsquo;t heard from her.</p>

<p><p>My angels say she&rsquo;s okay, but I&rsquo;m just writing to express my concern and sadness and to say, &ldquo;hey, I miss you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Today Dude and I worked more on MR Labs, and plan to unveil the new site at <a href="https://www.mrlaboratories.com">www.mrlaboratories.com</a> by Friday.</p>

<p><p>Gymnastics was fun this evening; I did some roundoff and super tall back flips with good height and all that good stuff. Yay!</p>

<p><p>I bounced on the trampoline and kinda scraped my neck vertebrae doing 15 front flips in a row, landing on my back each time.</p>

<p class=date>21:31 Friday 11 September 1998</p>

<p>Today started last night for me.  Manda came over and we talked and chilled and she had brought some Japanese crab burritos or something like that:  Crab, celery, rice, all rolled into a burrito shape with seaweed as the wrapper.  Good stuff.  She ate them mostly with soy sauce, I ate them mostly plain.

<p>Then she showed me the green stuff that came with the meal.  Looks kinda like play-doh.  A bit squishier.. maybe like hummus.

<p>But play-doh is salty, and hummus tastes a bit tangy.  This green stuff was hot.

<p>Oh yes! I recognized Lucian had a tube of this at Con Con!  Like a toothpaste tube, but I wouldn't try brushing my teeth with it. I took a splot of it on my finger.

<p>"This is for Lucian," and smeared it fully onto my tongue and squished it around my mouth <i>ohmygod</i>.  I closed my eyes and zoned on the sensation.  

<p>Tears poured out my eyes. If I breathed wrong, the vapor sizzled my nose... WOW.  To a dull burning the feeling chilled and then began to subside.  I squished the saliva around my mouth and swallowed it all down.

<p>Yeah.

<p>Manda was wide eyed like, "wow."

<p>We finished the burrito things (what <i>are</i> they called?) and at the end the green goop was left.  I smooshed it around with the chopsticks and tasted the hot residue on the sticks.  Hmm.  Again?

<p>Some twisted part of me said "yes" even though Manda was all, "'stotally up to you."  I got a bigger blob than Lucian had done at Con Con. I pondered it..  It only took 10 minutes last time; this couldn't take more than 15.  Smeared it on my tongue and onto the roof of my mouth.

<p><i>sizzle</i> went my tongue.  <i>ha ha</i> went the green stuff.  <i>eeep</i> went the burning sensation through my nose.
My eyes cried and I meditated on the whole process again.  mmmmm

<p>damn that was hot. Even now as I type, 24 hours later, I can still feel my tongue is raw.  Crazy stuff.  Try it!

<p>But what happened all day today?  Houston flooded.  That's what I originally intended to write about.  See the next entry.
