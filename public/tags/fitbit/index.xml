      <description>01:53 Friday 08 December 2017 JST I cannot understand how I could have lost my fitbit in two days. I received it from Prentiss on Monday night; I charged it the next day; I wore it for two days, and now I cannot find it.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t put it anywhere specific; it should be clipped to the pants I was wearing. Where did it go?
So sad.</description>
