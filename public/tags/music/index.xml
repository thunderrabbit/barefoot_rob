      <description>10:06 Thursday 11 January 2018 JST Really glad to hear LouStar has new tracks out!
Not sure if this link will work, but I bought &amp;ldquo;Favourite&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Not Gonna Lie&amp;rdquo;
Not gonna lie, but &amp;ldquo;Favourite&amp;rdquo; is my favorite of the two.

      <description>17:48 Thursday 13 April 2017 JST I found Underneath It All, a nine inch nails podcast, and as a result signed up for Google Music so I can listen to Hesitation Marks&amp;hellip; even though I already bought the album when it first came out&amp;hellip; because I haven&amp;rsquo;t really listened to it, because I have not had a CD player for a long time.</description>

      <description>23:24 Saturday 28 November 2015 JST After scoping the land in Okutama, Lin and I went to her sister&amp;rsquo;s place and enjoyed musical entertainment provided by her niece and nephews. Mikarin plays several instruments piano, xylophone, saxophone, recorder, (more?), and she played for us, including some of her own compositions.</description>

In karaoke, singing &amp;ldquo;The Last Blueberry&amp;rdquo; by Anikiko, I wanted to fast forward to the good part so quickly consumed the drink from the song carton. It seemed a bit strange, but the guy with me agreed it was the fastest way to fast-forward the song: fast-drink the drink!</description>
