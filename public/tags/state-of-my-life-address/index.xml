I&amp;rsquo;ve misplaced my template for writing States of My Life Addresses.
Work has been my main focus for a while; Mondays through Fridays I wake up usually at 7:30am, do a backup of the AB database, leave for work at 8; arrive at work at 9, eat my lunch that Lin made, work + read hacker news, buy a drink and snack around 4pm, leave at 6pm, meet Lin at Shinagawa station or at home, eat dinner, hang out, shower, sleep.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s 4:17am as I start this entry; it was 30 minutes ago that I went back to bed after waking up to pee and note that it&amp;rsquo;s not snowing outside.
Lin&amp;rsquo;s news sources said it would snow tomorrow. Her mom&amp;rsquo;s news sources said it would snow between 10 and 20 cm tomorrow. My weather app says it will rain tomorrow, and so far, my app is right.</description>

I just wrote this to my friend Laura
Hi Laura!!
You were in my dream last night! We were at a party; I think it was my birthday. Thanks for coming!! You were standing a bit away from the party fracas, so were the first person I saw when I came in. I was so happy to see you!! We kissed a little bit and then you were like, &amp;ldquo;okay, that&amp;rsquo;s enough, thunder buns&amp;rdquo; and then I woke up.</description>

 I haven&amp;rsquo;t written a SoML in a while.
 Fred and Ma are coming to Japan in December!!
 Lin and I have been going to yoga class every Saturday morning at Yogasan.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at sbstrm for going on 3 years now, not counting my Thailand adventure and chilling in Chigasaki.
 My long-running project at sbstrm is for AB, for whom Lin used to work.</description>
