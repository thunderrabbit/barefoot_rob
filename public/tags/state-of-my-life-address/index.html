                        <p>##10:17 Saturday 02 March 2013</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve misplaced my template for writing States of My Life Addresses.</p>

<p>Work has been my main focus for a while; Mondays through Fridays I wake up usually at 7:30am, do a backup of the AB database, leave for work at 8; arrive at work at 9,  eat my lunch that Lin made, work + read hacker news, buy a drink and snack around 4pm, leave at 6pm, meet Lin at Shinagawa station or at home, eat dinner, hang out, shower, sleep.</p>

<p>Variants of the M-F schedule include mediation in the morning, recently for 30 minutes.  I am &ldquo;soon&rdquo; going to make a simple app to be a meditation timer.  I have a name selected, but haven&rsquo;t secured it with Apple (did you know that all the apps in the Apple App Store have distinct names?) and I don&rsquo;t want the hordes of people who read my journal to hoard my good name idea.   haha anyway, I plan to make the app source code available on github, my first open source project of any magnitude.  But yes, for now it&rsquo;s vaporware.   (And yes, I know there are many meditation timers, but none of <em>the</em> feature that I want.)</p>

<p>Lin and I have been married for, um,.. a year and a half.  It&rsquo;s a bit confusing to me because our official marriage date of 4 July 2011 differs from  30 December 2011, our wedding date in Houston, by nearly 6 months, plus I have to do some thinkin&rsquo; to figure out the year, etc etc..  So we&rsquo;ve been married for a bit, and are still in the honeymoon stage of lovey dovey, ooey gooey, kissey kissy, happy sappy relationship, which I&rsquo;m quite enjoying.</p>

<p>We have our fair share of fights when I&rsquo;m an asshole, complaining about what she does, and, fortunately, she&rsquo;ll tell me straight up, &ldquo;yo!&rdquo; and we get it sorted pretty quickly.  I&rsquo;m certain that ability to get the shit out will continue to benefit us.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got a long-term plan to move to Taiwan, &ldquo;in 3 years,&rdquo; but no real date set.  Lin&rsquo;s mom is welcome to join, but appears that she will choose to stay close to her existing grandkids.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s crappy cold today.  Living up on the 13th floor, overlooking a relatively wide plain including a river and nothing much to hinder the wind, we can hear the whissing sound in the window, sometimes continuously.   My weather data says it&rsquo;s 8C now in Tokyo.   Wednesday and Thursday were a bit warmer than other recent days.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been working with Tariq on our next app, and recently got some advice from Matt who has organized the iOS meetups in Tokyo for the past long while.  Matt suggested replacing the ivars with properties, and I was like, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s an ivar?&rdquo; and I forgot what it stands for, but it means the variables declared inside the private implementation instead of the private interface.   (I think I have used many of the correct words here)</p>

<p>The app works on my devices, and on my simulators, but crashes on Tariq&rsquo;s iPad mini, but I haven&rsquo;t figured out why.  We think it might be his device; it can&rsquo;t play some other games, so we&rsquo;re going to continue development with the hope/belief that it will all be okay for the vast majority of iDevices.</p>

<p>At work, the app we made for a client was rejected because it gives &ldquo;discounts to physical goods or services,&rdquo; which it&rsquo;s been doing for years.  Now suddenly they reject it for that reason.  I&rsquo;ve been getting less and less impressed with Apple to the point that I&rsquo;ve stated that I&rsquo;ve purchased my last Apple device.  My plan is to put linux on this iMac when it&rsquo;s no longer strong enough to support the latest OS X in a couple years.  Then once this computer bites the big one, I&rsquo;ll buy a Chromebook or something.   We&rsquo;ll see how long this plan lasts.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s because &ldquo;not much is happening&rdquo; that I haven&rsquo;t really been writing in my journal.  It&rsquo;s just the same old boring stuff day after day.  I&rsquo;ve considered removing &ldquo;Keep Pushing The Limits&rdquo; from my journal; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve kept pushing the limits at all.</p>

<p>Welllll as I write this, I remember my same old boring daily routine does <em>not</em> include wearing shoes; I&rsquo;m approaching my 1 year anniversary of being barefoot in Japan, and it looks like I&rsquo;ve made it through the winter, being shod only on the days that it snowed, or when it was less than ~5C and rainy.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been unsubscribing from almost every email list I&rsquo;ve been on over the years.  I stopped reading them, so am stopping subscriptions.  That&rsquo;s my first step in taking control of my inbox again.  There are now 307 unread messages, and 963 messages in my inbox.</p>

<p>breakfast time! whoooo  cornbread is done!</p>

                        <p>##06:11 Wednesday 06 February 2013</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 4:17am as I start this entry; it was 30 minutes ago that I went <em>back</em> to bed after waking up to pee and note that it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> snowing outside.</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s news sources said it would snow tomorrow.  Her mom&rsquo;s news sources said it would snow between 10 and 20 cm tomorrow.  My weather app says it will rain tomorrow, and so far, my app is right.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love a snow day, not that I get the day off, but I like watching the snow fall, the footsteps, tire tracks, shovels all smush, squish, or whoosh the snow out of the way, and then watch the dirty snow slowly melt from its piles.</p>

<p>I noted that the weather forecast on the news showed a cutesy picture with three panels, making extremely clear the plan for people tomorrow.  The panels showed a car with tire chains, one more I can&rsquo;t remember, and a guy waking up early.  I complained to Lin that Japanese culture is too cutesy, and too caretaking.  Why make such a point to tell people that they have to wake up early tomorrow?  I can imagine a newscaster in the US closing the segment with &ldquo;.. might have to wake up early tomorrow.&rdquo; before moving on to the next story.</p>

<p>I was like, &ldquo;yeah, in the US they wouldn&rsquo;t spend 5 minutes showing an info graphic of what time people should wake up.  They&rsquo;d spend ten minutes telling who had killed whom, and, um, nevermind.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>Lin and I have been doing extremely well; I know we&rsquo;ve only been married 18 months or so, but we&rsquo;re still in that giddy &ldquo;no, I love <em>you</em> more!!&rdquo; phase, and I&rsquo;m really enjoying that.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s just gotten a new job that does <em>not</em> require forced, unpaid overtime, and even allows 30 minutes of break in addition to an hour lunch!  Wow what an amazing concept of keeping workers happy.  In her two previous jobs, people were so stressed to the point of being sick (not just sick, but like ulcers and doctors orders to take time off) that I was like, &ldquo;yeah you should probably quit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, we&rsquo;re on day #22 (or so; it&rsquo;s been a while, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s been a month) of saying, &ldquo;dude; let&rsquo;s move to Taiwan,&rdquo; so the plan is to keep working here a bit, save some money and then start looking to change countries, esp. to one her mom will also enjoy living or at least visiting.</p>

<p>Every time we greet each other, we bark up a storm (why&rsquo;d I use &ldquo;up a storm&rdquo; here?  weird) and are just so <em>happy</em> to see each other.</p>

<hr />

<p>For the past month or so, I&rsquo;ve been nearly daily reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, and at the bottom of one of the stories, I saw something like &ldquo;rilakkumaaaaaaaa likes this.&ldquo;  I thought &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s from <a href="https://www.san-x.co.jp/rilakkuma/">リラックマ</a>,&rdquo; some bear character whose name comes from the combination of &ldquo;relax&rdquo; meaning relax in English, and &ldquo;kuma&rdquo; a transliteration for the word that means bear in Japanese.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-06-at-4.49.38-AM.png"><img src="/images/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-06-at-4.49.38-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-06 at 4.49.38 AM" /></a></p>

<p>I translate their names as &ldquo;yellow bird,&rdquo; &ldquo;baby relax bear,&rdquo; and &ldquo;relax bear.&ldquo;  I guess the names are as good as &ldquo;big bird,&rdquo; &ldquo;cookie monster,&rdquo; and &ldquo;oscar the grouch.&ldquo;   (But <em>not</em> as good as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Snuffleupagus">Snuffleupagus</a>.)</p>

<p>But so anyway, I clicked the <a href="https://rilakkumaaaaaaaa.tumblr.com/">link to Rilakkumaaa&hellip;aa&rsquo;s page</a>, and I liked its content enough to come back a few times.   The author seems to post stories that have been posted by others (of stories that have been posted by others (of stories that have been posted by others (&hellip;))).  I clicked around in the group of cross posters and found an interesting style of animated images that I had not previously seen.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I can capture them here in the same way, but I&rsquo;d describe them as multiple panels of the same scene, taken from (slightly) different points of view, in slightly different points of time.</p>

<p>Because a lot of the sites had a lot of these types of animation sets, I wonder who produced the animations in the first place?  Okay, yes, obviously they gifs made from videos, but who takes the time to clip out slightly different time segments possibly from different cameras and paste them together in an easily posted format?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the apparent source of one photoset that&rsquo;s been reposted more than a few times: <a href="https://sarangtaeyeon.tumblr.com/post/31577460442/tiffany-mirror-mirror-who-is-the-prettiest-in">https://sarangtaeyeon.tumblr.com/post/31577460442/tiffany-mirror-mirror-who-is-the-prettiest-in</a></p>

<p><a href="/images/2013/02/tumblr_madwgsqmAr1ruwgl1o1_r1_250.gif"><img src="/images/2013/02/tumblr_madwgsqmAr1ruwgl1o1_r1_250.gif" alt="tumblr_madwgsqmAr1ruwgl1o1_r1_250" /></a> <a href="/images/2013/02/tumblr_madwgsqmAr1ruwgl1o2_r1_250.gif"><img src="/images/2013/02/tumblr_madwgsqmAr1ruwgl1o2_r1_250.gif" alt="tumblr_madwgsqmAr1ruwgl1o2_r1_250" /></a> <a href="/images/2013/02/tumblr_madwgsqmAr1ruwgl1o3_250.gif"><img src="/images/2013/02/tumblr_madwgsqmAr1ruwgl1o3_250.gif" alt="tumblr_madwgsqmAr1ruwgl1o3_250" /></a> <a href="/images/2013/02/tumblr_madwgsqmAr1ruwgl1o4_250.gif"><img src="/images/2013/02/tumblr_madwgsqmAr1ruwgl1o4_250.gif" alt="tumblr_madwgsqmAr1ruwgl1o4_250" /></a></p>

<p>While downloading them to post here, I noted the tag #akb48, which I assume means these girls are in the currently popular group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKB48#Reception">AKB48</a>, of which I know very little except they&rsquo;ve got a lot of fans.  One or more of them must have created these images.   Thank you, people, for making an interesting visual effect!</p>

<hr />

<p>At work, we&rsquo;ve been migrating our dev boxes and some smaller client sites to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>.  I&rsquo;ve been updating to our latest style framework the back-end website for sending newsletters to people.  The system now uses Amazon SES.  We plan to test-move our larger clients to AWS within a couple months.</p>

<p>I had a client request conversion of a field from a text field to a dropdown list (because she prefers mouse over keyboard).   I looked at the data and found over 200 different values in the database and advised against such a change.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be very happy with a 210-item drop down list, esp if you have to visit a different page to add items.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://trello.com/">trello</a> to keep track of little &ldquo;next steps&rdquo; in my projects both at home and work.  These may include notes to self to help my brain get back on track in the morning, and to protect against memory loss when being <a href="https://www.hadermann.be/blog/46/the-hidden-cost-of-interrupting-knowledge-workers/">inter</a><a href="https://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/">rupted</a>. My list to start &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s now 5:30am on said day) looks like this.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-06-at-5.54.25-AM.png"><img src="/images/2013/02/Screen-Shot-2013-02-06-at-5.54.25-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-02-06 at 5.54.25 AM" /></a></p>

<hr />

<p>Why haven&rsquo;t I been blogging a lot?  I guess because it takes a lot of time to write a lot and post accompanying pics.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tariq and I have been dealing with a memory issue in our latest (which is also our first) game.  I was like, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s gotta be because of the blocks&rdquo;  (it&rsquo;s my first time to use blocks in a project.  He was like, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s gotta be an error in some of the assets.&ldquo;   I wrote a version to load all the assets and it didn&rsquo;t always crash.   Then I compared the block usage in my app to the block usage in Snap!, from which I based some of the core code.   Oh snap, it&rsquo;s totally different!  I almost certainly need to completely redesign the underlying structure of my classes.   sigh.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, last night, when the news assured us it would snow today, we went to bed early so we could wake up early and go get breakfast near Lin&rsquo;s office so she&rsquo;d be at work on time for her fourth day of work.   We planned to leave at 6:10am, which is now, but there&rsquo;s no snow, so the trains will be on time, and no reason to try to go early.  So I&rsquo;m going back to bed for an hour.</p>

<p>I wonder if I will meditate for 30 minutes when I wake up.</p>

                        <p>##07:58 Wednesday 16 January 2013</p>

<p>I just wrote this to my friend Laura</p>

<p>Hi Laura!!</p>

<p>You were in my dream last night!  We were at a party; I think it was my birthday.  Thanks for coming!!  You were standing a bit away from the party fracas, so were the first person I saw when I came in.  I was so happy to see you!!  We kissed a little bit and then you were like, &ldquo;okay, that&rsquo;s enough, thunder buns&rdquo; and then I woke up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started doing morning meditations and writing again for my soul connectivity.  Lin and I are both working, she&rsquo;s working for a temp agency while looking for different full time work, including possibly overseas! I&rsquo;m working for a startup which has just recently hired another guy, so we are up to four people now.   We do websites and mobile app development.</p>

<p>On the side, I&rsquo;m doing iPhone app development with a guy; we have one app available in the US, and are working on another set of game apps now.</p>

<p>For a few days/weeks near the end of last year, I was doing a bit of genealogical research, just by interviewing a couple people in Lin&rsquo;s family who live here in Tokyo.   I put some of the data on <a href="https://familysearch.org/">https://familysearch.org/</a> and was excited to see new names connected to some names I knew from my old research with you.  I found an ancestral link that extended back back back to some kings and queens.  I was like whoohoo!  Show me the money!!!   and then back back back to Jesus and I was like, whoohoo wait he had siblings???? and then back back back to Adam and Eve, labeled First Man and First Woman, and I kinda lost my interest.</p>

<p>Up to what have you recently been?</p>

<p>xoxoxoxox

<ul>
<li><p>I haven&rsquo;t written a SoML in a while.</p></li>

<li><p>Fred and Ma are coming to Japan in December!!</p></li>

<li><p>Lin and I have been going to yoga class every Saturday morning at <a href="https://yogasan.net">Yogasan</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been working at sbstrm for going on 3 years now, not counting my Thailand adventure and chilling in Chigasaki.</p></li>

<li><p>My long-running project at sbstrm is for AB, for whom Lin used to work.</p></li>

<li><p>Most recently been working on A4F&rsquo;s new site, rebuilding their wordpress site with the latest iteration of our custom framework.</p></li>

<li><p>After work, I&rsquo;ve been working with Tariq on iPhone development.  We have three apps out at this time: Mike&rsquo;s English outside Japan, and 楽しい英語, and 読み書き英語 available in Japan.  They are not free apps, and I think that may have been a mistake. Might make them free and have in-app purchases for goodies in the apps.</p></li>

<li><p>Most recently been working on a 2D game app using Cocos2D and Box2D.  I&rsquo;ve been looking at the option of using Sparrow and Chipmunk as well, though Chipmunk doesn&rsquo;t yet support iOS 6.0 due to some bugs in XCode compilers or something.</p></li>

<li><p>So right <em>now</em>, while I&rsquo;m typing, my computer is downloading XCode 4.3.3 so I can get a copy of iphoneos5.1.sdk so I can evaluate Chipmunk.</p></li>

<li><p>My computer is new since my last SoML.  It&rsquo;s a Macbook Pro, with retina display, 256Gig SSD drive, and 16 GB of RAM.  It&rsquo;s not as fast as it should be, though it is faster than my previous machine.  Sometimes Finder just locks up and loses its mind for 20 seconds and then starts working again.  Why?</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;m running OS X 10.7.5 (&ldquo;Lion&rdquo;) because I still haven&rsquo;t received my &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; code to Mountain Lion.</p></li>

<li><p>For iPhone dev purposes, I got an iPhone 5.  Its name is Johnny Five, named after the character in Short Circuit.  For AU evaluation purposes (plus they allow tethering (feeding WiFi to local devices from my phone via its cellular service)), I&rsquo;m using AU instead of Softbank.  Interesting tidbit: it took me about 1 day to get my iPhone 5 after they were released.   Lin ordered hers through softbank (on the same day as I ordered mine through AU), and didn&rsquo;t get a call from them for a couple weeks, during which time she was like, &ldquo;bah&rdquo; and told them they can keep their phone when they said it was finally available. </p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve still got my iPhone4S for everyday use.  Its name is Little Blue Monkey, because when I first got it, I had a blue case for it.</p></li>

<li><p>I recently wrote a Wordpress plugin to create bingo cards, but haven&rsquo;t polished it nor a site to run it.</p></li>

<li><p>Due to all this coding, I haven&rsquo;t drawn any mazes recently, though I did get a maze request via <a href="https://fiverr.com/thunderrabbit">Fiverr</a> recently.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been reading A Course In Miracles; I&rsquo;m about this far through the book which is THIS thick.</p></li>

<li><p>I haven&rsquo;t played Minecraft in about a week.</p></li>

<li><p>Recently Andrew and I received the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PM82UE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009PM82UE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=keepusthelim-20">Elevation Docks</a> we ordered a long time ago.  They&rsquo;re quite nice.  I got limited edition green one; he got orange.  We also each got a <del>silver</del> brushed aluminum and black one.  Lin got my silver one, and the black one is on my desk at work.</p></li>
