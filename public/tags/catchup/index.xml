      <description>11:58 Saturday 16 September 2017 JST I put this leaf down but before it could grow much past the pics shown here, it got cleaned up by the annual clearing done by city workers.
 
After the annual clear cut seemed to be complete, I found a spot that had not been cleared. It is still in the same park, but on a sidewalk, so maybe it will be clearcut by a different team.</description>

      <description>10:49 Tuesday 09 August 2016 JST One of my rules of journaling is to just start again instead of trying to catch up on old events. So before I break that rule, here&amp;rsquo;s now:
Right now I&amp;rsquo;m on the train headed to Ebisu to meet S at CB for our weekly meeting. I was hoping to have it yesterday cause I was in the area, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have any other reason to come today.</description>
