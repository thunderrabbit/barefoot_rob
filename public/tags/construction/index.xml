      <description>12:07 Thursday 27 June 2019 JST Today on my way back home from lunch, I saw a construction site which was overlookable from a pretty steep hill just beside it.
  
By standing on the guardrail, I could easily have fallen forward over their fence. Nice shot, though!</description>

      <description>20:22 Thursday 03 May 2018 JST This looks like a bridge from the sidewalk level over here to the roof level over there. Not enough room for an elevator; I am not sure what this might be for.</description>

      <title>Noborito station is getting a new southbound line</title>

      <description>18:34 Sunday 27 August 2017 JST I have been taking (but not really posting) pictures of the new train line in Noborito station. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s part of the campaign Odakyu has been announcing that they will reduce the congestion on the line, and even decrease the time required to go to Shinjuku.
Anyway, they did something which surprised me: put down the rails, locked them down, then took them back up before laying them down again.</description>

      <description>16:17 Wednesday 29 July 2015 JST Oh my gosh wow!!! I like watching construction so I often take pictures of construction sites. Today I was having a gander at new building construction near 金沢八景駅 and I noticed a big digger thing suspended over a large vertical tube. Then I noticed the tube was slowly rotating!
I started taking video with Periscope (so it&amp;rsquo;s online now, even before this message is written) and stepped over a fence, which gained the attention from an English speaking security guard!</description>

      <description>##16:14 Wednesday 25 March 2015 JST##
I took a few pictures of some old buildings and an empty lot, all of which will soon apparently become a construction site.
This is between 京急 and シーサイド lines respective 金沢八景stations, an area that&amp;rsquo;s been undeveloped for quite some years! I can remember coming here about 11 years ago with someone Frank&amp;rsquo;s NOVA classes. She taught me the phrase まじで？ And the same night we heard someone use it.</description>
