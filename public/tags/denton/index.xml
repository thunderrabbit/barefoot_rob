(transcribed out of my diary)
 Sunday night Wende and I drove to Denton to harass Fred in class Monday.  We played 2 versions of the Alphabet Game (*) and had wonderful conversation on the way up there. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what we talked about, but it was great.  Once we got there, I essentially fell asleep immediately after we got back from shopping for milk, OJ &amp;amp; pizza.</description>
