      <description>17:36 Friday 11 September 2015 JST Mark and I are on an island featuring 500 permanent residents and maybe as many tourists; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.
I wanted to climb on some rocks behind the whale statue, but he wanted to go to the beach to check that out, so I climbed on rocks there. Then I walked on rocks toward the onsen where there was some man made pier which I poo-pooed as boring, but Mark wanted to check it out.</description>
