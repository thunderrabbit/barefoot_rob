      <description>07:27 Thursday 25 February 2016 JST Gary! We were just approved for a house loan to buy our first house! It&#39;s 20km from the coast (20 x further than now, so safer from tsunamis), larger than our current rental house, and half the monthly cost! yay! It&#39;s all electric, so when free energy technology is released, we&#39;ll be ready! My train commutes will be longer, so I plan to spend more time drawing my art https://art.</description>
