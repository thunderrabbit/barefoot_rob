<p>Ugh.  I previously uploaded version 2.2.1 of an iOS app.  This time I
uploaded 2.2.3 and the reply was &ldquo;Oh you already uploaded version
2.2.3&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fine ffs so I boosted the version to 2.2.4 and uploaded it.</p>

<p>Now they say the version number must be higher than 2.21.</p>

<p><em>I never uploaded 2.21</em>!!111  I uploaded 2.2.1.  WTF kinda checks are
they doing?  This is sofa king annoying.</p>

<p>I called Apple Worldwide Support to ask why their docs say I need
LaunchImages with sizes X, Y, Z, while an error message says I need a
LaunchImage of size A.  Their answer: accept the new Terms and
Conditions and try my upload again.</p>

<p>Oh XCode, you&rsquo;re so quirky.</p>

<p>You automatically change Images.xcassets, automatically <code>add</code> the
changes to git, AND automatically restore the changes after I revert
them.  This might be helpful if you did not <em>also</em> refuse to build the
app due to missing images.  I hate building iOS apps.  Utterly shit
experience all the fucking time.</p>

<p>Why do sandboxed users have to have difficult passwords?  I don&rsquo;t mind
good passwords for real users, but not for sandboxed users.  AND keep
your password requirements written near where we make the users.  I
had to look that shit up on Stack Overflow.  OH, so not only must it
be 8 characters, have numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, we
cannot have consecutive letters, cannot have common passwords, and
something else?  Screw you and your password requirements for
sandboxed users Apple!   Why not do something like support your devs
by making a ChuckNorris password that we can all just use?</p>

<p>test@apple.com with password SteveJobs (or if we have to fit your lame
requirements Stev3Jobs) AND THEN JUST LOG IN!!   Use the Device ID to
distinguish who is whom.  Or even simpler, drop the requirements for
strong passwords for sandbox users!</p>

<p>Now that I got logged in, I get &ldquo;Transaction error: Cannot connect to iTunes Store&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bit boring, but talking to Mark in the QA room, I was able to get
some insight on how to handle some aspects of the app we&rsquo;re making.</p>

<pre><code>NSURLsession
NSData  buffer , length
gfxCardStatus
</code></pre>

<p>He also gave a good idea for how to put all the junk for each mode of
our game in separate views!  It should make the modal idea completely
unnecessary.  Woohoo!  Thanks, Mark!</p>

<h2 id="11-35">11:35</h2>

<p>Buuuuut it&rsquo;s not working.</p>

<h2 id="next-session">next session</h2>

<p>AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate</p>

<p>AVPlayerItem
    navigation marker groups
    interstitial something something
    externalMetadata</p>

<p>AVAsset</p>

<h2 id="12-03">12:03</h2>

<p>interesting(?) command line tool</p>

<pre><code>mediastreamvalidator
</code></pre>

<h2 id="17-29">17:29</h2>

<p>The app is much better for having spoken with Mark and Stefan.
Instead of abusing the top bar with <code>Word List</code>, <code>Play Game</code> and <code>Play
Game</code>, it&rsquo;s now <code>Word List</code> and <code>Play Games</code>.  The Games tab brings up
a screen to select one or the other game.</p>

<p>Sweet.</p>

<p>I also met Guierrmo and saw Tom from iOS meetup.  Or he saw and
recognized me.</p>

<p>Tom and I walked back to Shinjuku station together.  He said he got a
lot out of the event, and he kinda helped me see a good side of Apple
and not just the poopy poop I keep complaining about.</p>

<p>Guierrmo gave me his card and said he can help or help me get in touch
with the right person!</p>

showing images, quit responding to any clicks, and wouldn&rsquo;t
acknowledge even that its window was selected.</p>

<p>Yeah, um, Finder is like the most basic user app in OS X; it&rsquo;s the
only one that cannot be turned off.  Ya might want to make sure it works.</p>

<p>Reason number 8,147 to hate apple:</p>

<p>Lin bought some credit on itunes store.  I added it to her phone,
intrigued by how the camera can find the letters on the back of the
card even while I rotated it while it tried to scan.</p>

<p>So she wanted to make a purchase&hellip;  And have to verify her account.
Not just with password, but with two (2) personal questions.  &ldquo;Where
did you first pet a monkey?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What was your first Butthole Surfers
album?&rdquo; or something.</p>

<p>Lin doesn&rsquo;t remember the answers to the questions, so I pressed the
link that says &ldquo;I forgot&rdquo;.</p>

<p>That interface doesn&rsquo;t work.  When I enter her email address, it
autostupidly goes to the iforgot.apple.com and won&rsquo;t let me enter the
password.</p>

<p>God I hate apple.</p>

<p>Okay, so I just received in the mail my <a href="https://welcome.moov.cc/">MOOV</a>, a movement tracking device which
can connect to my phone via BLE, Bluetooth Low Energy.  Nice.</p>

<p>All excited to set it up, I see the app requires iOS 8.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve resisted many a fancy app which has had this requirement.  I
don&rsquo;t want to cripple my iPhone 4S with an &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; to the OS which I
don&rsquo;t really need.</p>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-on-the-iphone-4s-a-stay-of-execution-nothing-more/">https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/ios-9-on-the-iphone-4s-a-stay-of-execution-nothing-more/</a></p>

<p>The above article title doesn&rsquo;t sound good for iOS 9, but at the end
they&rsquo;re like &ldquo;bah might as well do it&rdquo; (my paraphrase)</p>

<p>So I clicked the fancy Install Now link on my phone.</p>

<p>I see the password dialog, anddddd can&rsquo;t paste my password into it.</p>

<p>Fuck you, Apple.  Fuck you if you think this in any way is a smart
design decision.  Basically you want me to have a shitty password so
that I can type it here?  I can&rsquo;t use my password
E4&rsquo;h&lt;v,ei7\,R!nwo/e-&lsquo;W9gvYG;P% very easily now can I?  You think I&rsquo;m
going to type that shit in on your shitty keyboard?</p>

<p>This is like the 100th extra nail in the already decrepit coffin for
my relationship with Apple.</p>

<p>I want a divorce, all my money back, plus damages for pain and suffering.</p>

<h3 id="cause-anyway">cause anyway</h3>

<p>Is it not bad enough that I can only use 32 characters for my
password? I&rsquo;d love to know why they decided to add that crappy limitation.</p>
