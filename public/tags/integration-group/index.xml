      <description>11:38 Friday 26 January 2018 JST Great integration group council meeting today. I got some great ideas for how to help invite new men into the work. I mean the same type of work in The Work.
Blessings to all the men who make this work possible.</description>

      <description>20:51 Friday 25 September 2015 JST We met at Takeshi&amp;rsquo;s tonight, our first meeting in over a year, I imagine. The last meeting I called in an emergency being all confuzzled about junk, though the issues mostly resolved by the time the meeting happened.
This meeting was called from a much more sane and golden space: I&amp;rsquo;m going to staff NWTA in October, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to help our I-group grow.</description>
