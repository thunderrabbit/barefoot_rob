      <description>15:51 Tuesday 18 September 2018 JST I got an email from Netflix saying they are going to raise prices starting soon. They did not list the options that were available, but had some indication that I could change my plan or cancel if I wanted. I was not logged in to Netflix on my mobile phone so I left the email in my inbox to deal with later.
Sat down to Netflix and chill today and a new dialog box popped up.</description>
