<p>Dang.  I cannot seem to get Godot to detect collisions; I have some
phsyics bodies fixed on the screen but dragging other physics bodies
goes right through them.</p>

<p>Still working on our <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/">open source Godot game, ConSwi</a> (which I think is
the perfect name, my partners are both saying they want a longer name
that is more descriptive), I got piece dragging to follow the mouse
properly.  Originally I had the drag only active when the cursor was
over the piece, so if the mosue went too quickly, the piece would no
longer receive the input and lose track of the piece.</p>

<p>Now I have refactored the code that was used to catch what I called
&ldquo;Orphaned Swipes,&rdquo; meaning swipes that were released out in the play
field as opposed to exactly on the last piece.</p>

<p>OrphanSwipeCatcher is now GameSwipeDetector, and is now its own class,
which allowed me to move a decent amount of code out of Game.gd and
allowed drags to be detected even if the drag point moved off of the
piece being dragged.</p>

<p>This refactor is still in progress; there are some more functions
related to swipes and drags that can be moved to GameSwipeDetector.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Godot for dealing with memory management and
allowing my semi-noodled-code so I can focus on functionality of the
game.  I can imagine Travis&rsquo; shock when he reads that!</p>

<p>Today I met with Tariq and Dipendra to talk about ConSwi.  They are
all excited about the graphics and I am in the camp of getting a
minimum viable product out. I want to empower Dipendra to update the
graphics in the app.  He got a copy of Conswi from Github.  Instead of
giving him write access to the app, I had him create his own account
and push to his own ConSwi.</p>

<p>Although it is a fork, I assume it is not counted as a fork from
Github&rsquo;s point of view.  I wonder if that is possible to make happen.
Probably not if it has not been implemented already.</p>

<p>Dang it is 5:30 and already dark.  I remember our 5pm picture in Sao
Paolo was like noon here.</p>

<p>I met Dipendra today, a young man with design chops that far exceed my
own, and even Tariq&rsquo;s.  He is interested in doing the images for
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi">ConSwi, our swipe game</a> we
are making in Godot.</p>

<p>We met in a room that used to be a car showroom, but now features a
coffee shop because the car showroom was not making enough money.</p>

<p>I showed Dipendra how to get started with Godot and git.</p>

<p>Now headed home, but I will be back out tonight for Apocrypha, where I
will be telling my TJ Bike story of riding around Japan for 2 months.</p>

<p>Around 11am or so I hope to work on Marble Track 3.</p>

<p>Special thanks to C for letting me work here instead of heading back
home and back out for co-gender meeting.  Cats seem (un)interested in
helping me work, and now there is a presentation traipsing through,
but I got 2 pomodoros finished on ConSwi.</p>

<p>Did five pomodoros on ConSwi today, including refactoring the code to
ostensibly make it simpler, but for some reason I could not get the
tiles to respond to touches.  So I will try to make an overlay that
captures all touches and have it tell which piece got touched.</p>

<p><a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a>(referral link) has a
neat feature of parsing the Intention and automatically marking it as
complete.  I will definitely take advantage of that in the future.</p>

<p>Conswi is my temporary name for this game we are working on.  It&rsquo;s a
fake name with Latin influence.  Fred has a couple days off and we may
work on it together (and play Minecraft).  He has been teaching C++,
so learning another language may be fun.  I like working with my bro.</p>
