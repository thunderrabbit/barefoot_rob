      <description>SWUUSI
3am Friday 31 July 1998
transcribed from my diary I got super hugs when I went back to the main cabin after &#34;my first shower since Sunday morning!&#34; &#34;Yay Rob!&#34; and hugs all around. Played koosh with Clark, Jessica, Nathan Sexton, and Bryn and others before dinner. Gave advisors Mary Angel and Dorian back massages and then it was time for worship. I had been asked to lead a senior circle through some type of guided mediation.</description>
