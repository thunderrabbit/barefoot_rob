      <description>23:32 Thursday 24 December 2015 JST I bought the bear Lin wanted (after telling her repeatedly that I would not). It&amp;rsquo;s been in a bag on the shelves next to my bed for nearly a month I guess.
Last night before Lin got home, I took her oldest bear from its spot in the living room and exchanged it with the new bear, which has somewhat darker fur, but still &amp;ldquo;light brown&amp;rdquo; moreso that &amp;ldquo;dark brown&amp;rdquo;</description>

After I said / hinted to Fred that I&amp;rsquo;d love to play Minecraft with him on a world that I&amp;rsquo;ve been tweaking for months over the past couple years, he said he knew what he wanted for Christmas.
So today, I did a big step towards buying Minecraft for Fred: update my beneficiary bank account in the US with GoLloyds GoRemit.
That way I can pay off my credit card (most of which was due to my having bought a follower on Twitter), so I can feel less dumb about charging MC to my MC.</description>
