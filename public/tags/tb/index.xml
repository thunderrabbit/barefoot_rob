      <description>13:54 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST Good lesson today at TB; they had just redone the place so I got a grand tour of the show room. Midori talked to some clients while Tomoko gave me the tour. They didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to check yet, but I saw lots of word-for-word translations which we will have to clean up later.
They actually had to leave 10 minutes earlier than normal, so I headed out at 1:50pm.</description>
