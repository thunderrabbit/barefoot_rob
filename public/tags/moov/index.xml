      <description>22:11 Thursday 10 December 2015 JST Really happy with the reply I got from MOOV customer service!
I had hoped to get the original price, but I got a discount on my replacement moov! I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Lin&amp;rsquo;s device (since she didn&amp;rsquo;t use it as much as I used mine), so I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to give hers back to her soon and get back onto my moovin&amp;rsquo; program!
On their customer service feedback thing I wrote</description>

      <description>00:39 Wednesday 09 December 2015 JST Booooo.
I had used my MOOV on the way to the toy store, but noticed it missing when I got back to Kawasaki. It may have fallen off when I took off my shoes after the lesson. I&amp;rsquo;m optimistic I&amp;rsquo;ll get it back!
email to MOOV customer support: I&#39;m so sad! I wonder if you have a perk like 1-free-replacement- MOOV-to-those-who-bought-2-MOOVs-during-preorder-a-long-time-ago- and-lost-one-recently In my mind, I&#39;ve designed a kick-ass HEY_MOOV_DONT_MOVE wrapper to keep my MOOV from moving too far.</description>

      <description>14:11 Monday 30 November 2015 JST I did some walking intervals with MOOV. Did basically 5000 steps at around 124 steps per minute.</description>

      <description>23:59 Monday 23 November 2015 JST So anyway, I set up Lin&amp;rsquo;s MOOV device on her phone, and I just tweeted to the MOOV team that I&amp;rsquo;ll likely buy a new phone so I can use my MOOV device.
Turns out, I should just be able to switch my SIM card to new phone and not even tell my provider, so I can keep my unlimited data plan.</description>
