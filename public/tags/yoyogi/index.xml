      <description>01:43 Wednesday 30 August 2017 JST Hung out with Lisa and Jorge in Yoyogi park tonight. Had invited some other people, but they weren&amp;rsquo;t available for various reasons.
Lisa arrived first and she and I chatted until Jorge arrived. Kinda like a life-sized ouija board, we found a perfect spot in the grass beyond the lakes. Sat and chatted for four hours! Such a nice evening getting to know them better.</description>

      <description>last night (written 07:39 Monday 05 June 2017 JST)
Two weeks ago, I chose the location for Caroline&amp;rsquo;s presentation yesterday. The setting worked out quite well, for those people who were able to find it. Seems that a couple people were lost in the park.
Lin came to the lecture as well. yay! I&amp;rsquo;m glad she really enjoyed it, and could witness some of the reactions people had (crying) when meeting/greeting Caroline.</description>

      <description>20:49 Saturday 08 August 2015 JST Satomi said her friend Kenji liked to climb trees so we should all do so! Today was the day; we met in Yoyogi Park at 4pm. At first it was Satomi and Zakky, and then I showed up and we went into Yoyogi. Kenji and his wife Sherry (sp) came as well, and their friend Ozan lives nearby so joined the fun. He said he wasn&amp;rsquo;t good at climbing trees, but we had fun playing badmitton and throwing a hard tennis ball at velcro mitts.</description>
