      <description>##21:54 Tuesday 24 February 2015 JST##
Just got some nighttime photos of a logo at Shibuya scramble for a guy on Fiverr. He&amp;rsquo;s got a pretty interesting project, encouraging education through what looks like a fantasy adventure motif.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked carefully through the materials, but the website is magicaemathematica.com.
Somewhat foolishly, I forgot to charge my phone so it died after the took &amp;ldquo;10 or 20 photos&amp;rdquo;. Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ve done that before; stress the battery in a sprint and it dies like boom.</description>
