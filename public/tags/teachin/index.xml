      <description>15:25 Monday 13 July 2015 JST Taught for two hours at HN today; the students were a bit(!) more talkative today on day 3 of 5. Even Takeo said something without being directly prompted!
Rin showed me that he had done some research on 9&amp;frasl;11, and came up with the summary, 怖い　（こわい）. I was like &amp;ldquo;yep&amp;rdquo;
But I gave him the name Zeitgeist to balance out Loose Change, which I wrote after Operation Northwoods and Gulf of Tonkin.</description>
