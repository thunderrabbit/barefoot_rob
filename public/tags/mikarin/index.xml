      <description> 09:13 Saturday 13 April 2019 JST Excited to go to Yomiuriland with Lin and Mikarin today!
21:22 Saturday 13 April 2019 JST Just got back home, though we left Yomiuriland around 5pm. Pretty early from my point of view, but they were both tired.
Good times.

      <description>00:07 Tuesday 01 May 2018 JST Mikarin was nearly the headliner for her piano recital today. 21 different performances, and hers was number 19. #21 was done by the two teachers, so it kinda doesn&amp;rsquo;t even count. Anyway, great job!</description>

      <description>20:30 Sunday 17 May 2015 JST Headed home from Mikarin&amp;rsquo;s birthday party. Lin&amp;rsquo;s driving her uncle&amp;rsquo;s minivan with me, her mom, aunt, and uncle.
Mikarin played a nice song on piano and then was like, 自分で作りました、&amp;rdquo;I wrote it.&amp;rdquo; Wow! I wonder if she can/should copyright it.
She and Takun did a magic show for us, including a couple tricks I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to figure out.
Takun tried one trick that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to figure out; the die kept showing the same number.</description>
