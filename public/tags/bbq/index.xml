      <description>21:57 Sunday 20 May 2018 JST Great day at a park, but there were briars in the grass. Got to talk to Aaron for quite a bit and catch up with Francine who invited him. My student Misato attended and joined our little outing to find a nearby geocache which she was actually the one to find.
I napped for 30 minutes in the tent that went largely unused.</description>
