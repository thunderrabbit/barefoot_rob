      <description>16:50 Saturday 20 January 2018 JST I wonder how to find all contiguous 8-tile shapes.
They should be formable without crossing over my line.
These are okay
XXXXXXXX  XX X XXX XX  This is no good because I cannot reach all the Xs without backtracking.
 X XXX XXXXX  I guess I can slap it together on codemonkey.net or whatever</description>

      <description>14:02 Sunday 24 December 2017 Godot is super great for fast and easy development. I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten to the export stage yet, but hopefully that will be as easy. I was able to add a queue to display the upcoming pieces in about an hour, including distractions.

      <description>8:27 Thursday 21 December 2017 -03 I am making a swipe game which requires the user to swipe specific shapes.
XX XX  or
XXXX  or
X X X X  excetera (haha)
I will have a list of tile coordinates which were swiped.
(3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)  Above coordinates would match the horizontal XXXX (or is it vertical? Anyway,)
I can imagine comparing the above list to a list calculated from</description>

      <description>8:46 Tuesday 19 December 2017 I finished what I&amp;rsquo;m calling v0.0.1.X of my Godot game. Now the pieces fall via gravity, can be moved via keypress, and can be dropped quickly to the bottom of the screen..</description>

      <description>19:40 Friday 27 October 2017 JST Playing the stupid paperclip game cost me $50. Okay, maybe I am stupid instead of the game, but due to its clever design, I waited to the last minute to get my train (for a substitute lesson in a location with which I am unfamiliar). My train ended up being late, I missed(*) my next connection, and the client said &amp;ldquo;screw it&amp;rdquo; and cancelled the lesson.</description>

      <description>16:49 Sunday 25 October 2015 JST Now we&amp;rsquo;re playing Relic Expedition,

which is far more complicated. :-)
Relic Expedition features a lot more strategy; there are far more options available per player per turn, including cases where each player gets to move NPCs during another player&amp;rsquo;s turn.</description>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Tokyo
https://www.facebook.com/KingOfTokyoGame
a fun analog game with dice and random cards to add chance, and the option of re-rolling dice to give some strategy. We were playing with 5 players, so it was mostly a game of staying alive moreso than using the cards to do tricksy stuff.
I lost, Johan won!</description>

Oh man. I went back to the toy store today and found Perilous Pipes to be even more difficult than Say Cheese!
I therefore bought it for Fred.</description>
