<blockquote>
<p>In the meantime, maybe write up your personal history and your goals
for the work you want done, and Iâ€™ll study it ahead of time, so we
can jump right in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was a child, my dad showed me how to use coat hangers as
divining sticks to find water.  At the time, I thought it was strange.
&ldquo;Why should I have to use sticks if I can just think the question and
know the answer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not apparently put this intuition to any practical purpose, but
I did do a few Tarot card readings based on this kind of channeled
information. I hadn&rsquo;t read about individual card meanings in Tarot,
But I would have people ask a question and then choose cards at
randomly and then I would just freestyle information that came
through.</p>

<p>I grew fascinated with the idea of &ldquo;astral travel&rdquo; and consciously, I
got as far as lucid dreaming, But not astral travel that I know of, or
at least not in the way that my imagination wanted it to happen.</p>

<p>If I practice recalling my dreams, while dreaming, I will often
recognize that &ldquo;I am in that place where I can fly and control things&rdquo;
But while in that dream state, I usually don&rsquo;t recall that my physical
body is somewhere.</p>

<p>One time while sleeping, I was doing gymnastics that I realized I
couldn&rsquo;t do my physical body.  I recognize I was in some state
of consciousness where my consciousness was outside of my body. (After
listening to your lecture, I guess this was my etheric body outside my
physical body.)</p>

<p>In the way that I naturally have proprioception, I realized my body
was folded over (which my physical body cannot do under normal waking
conditions).  I tried to allow myself to float out of my body. I got
as far as my body being up in the air, but my head was stuck inside my
head.</p>

<p>I slowly came back into waking consciousness and felt my body gliding
down into my physical body in a smooth transition, featuring lots of
vibrational tingling as the bodies merged.  (Maybe this is the same
tingling as in the shower exercise you mentioned.)</p>

<p>I felt a lot of joy and excitement around this, and I began seeking
things to study.  I read one of Robert Monroe&rsquo;s books and soon went to
The Monroe Institute for their week long Gateway Voyage residential
training (in 1997 or so, a few years after his death).</p>

<p>At TMI&rsquo;s Gateway Voyage, I had a few interesting experiences regarding
states of consciousness, but did not &ldquo;astral travel&rdquo; the way I had
hoped.</p>

<p>We got to meet Joe McMoneagle and I became facinated with the how the
Life Review works upon death (or near death).   (You mentioned the
tunnel of light and said you can talk more about  that process.  I
would be curious to do so as I remember one of my experiences as a
ghost believing I did not deserve to go through the tunnel.)</p>

<p>At TMI, we watched the Powers of Ten video
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_Ten_(film)#1977_(%22Final%22)_version">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_Ten_(film)#1977_(%22Final%22)_version</a>
and I cried for a grain of sand in the sidewalk after recognizing how
it had been ignored despite is crucial role in the world.</p>

<p>Around the same time, I began emotional catharsis work with Mankind
Project.  In my weekend training, I realized I was physically a man.
At age 27, I still felt like a boy.</p>

<p>I am going to make a jump here from biography to underlying patterns.</p>

<p>I often suffer from anger issues.  I once complained to my parents
that they were being too nice to each other.  I might describe their
behavior now as having been codependent.  They didn&rsquo;t take care of
their own needs first.</p>

<p>I have often given my power away to women, trying to make mommy happy
so that I can get her love.  I recognize that the work is to be done
within myself, and the reality of the world around me is a reflection
of that.  These are words I can say theoretically, but I don&rsquo;t really
know what they mean for me nor how to apply them in my life.</p>

<p>I often fall into crushes with women, and I have learned to deal with
that by simply not acting on it&hellip;</p>

<p>I get the very most easily angry when I judge people do not understand
me.  (How very curious I find myself in a cross-cultural marriage
where not being understood is the norm.)</p>

<p>Looking for the source of this anger regarding communication, the only
things that have kind of made sense are from past lives that I&rsquo;ve
uncovered.</p>

<p>One spontaneous past life memory was when my army buddy was killed
after not listening to my guidance.</p>

<p>In another past life, there was a larger scale massacres where
thousands of my men were ambushed and died due to a tactical mistake I
had made.  (where they DID listen to me and it got them killed)</p>

<p>In other past life news, I have a birthmark where apparently I was
stabbed, and I recall dying, feeling so sad that my wife would not get
the money that I had earned while being in war.  (This lifetime, the
first time I washed my wife&rsquo;s back, I remembered that it was not the
first time I had washed her back, and in fact my present-lifetime wife
may have played the role of the woman who I left with kids while I
died in battle.)</p>

<p>In a different past life, I remember being a big simple man, who was
taking care of by a witch who lived up the hill because she was
ostracized by the community.  She would send me into town with simple
shopping tasks.</p>

<p>In a different past life (which I mentioned above), I committed ritual
suicide and remained on earth believing my transgression had been too
great to let me go to &lsquo;heaven&rsquo;.  The facilitator (Kevin Turner, who
you may well know) said &ldquo;look up&rdquo; and my dead-self looked up and was
shocked to see everyone waiting patiently for me.  My physical self
started bawling and crying like oh my god finally, etc etc.</p>

<p>Back to my present lifetime:</p>

<p>At age 8 or so this lifetime, my dad told me how incredibly smart and
talented I was.  In some ways, this information has been a curse on
me, as I have assumed I should be able to figure things out.  I often
shame myself for not having figured things out the first time through.</p>

<p>In a different anecdote from this lifetime, my dad and I were paddling
in a canoe on the lake somewhere.  It was a beautiful father-son
experience. His friend came by with the small motorboat, and offered to
tow us ashore.  The experience of the raw speed in a canoe was
thrilling.  I absolutely loved it and would love to do it again
sometime.  Afterward, my dad said his friend said I was &ldquo;grinning from
ear to ear.&rdquo;  I hated to know that I had been seen and that I had
been somehow caught in this moment of joy.</p>

<p>And yet another anecdote from this lifetime, my dad knocked down a
wasps&rsquo; nest from under the eave of our house.  The wasps were all dead,
but I was still scared of the nest.  I gathered up all of my courage
and threw the nest into the street, then suddenly heard cheers from my
parents.  I was shocked and angry that they had been watching me the
whole time.  Somehow my test of courage had not been such a test after
all.  I should&rsquo;ve known it wasn&rsquo;t dangerous because they (apparently)
knew it.</p>

<p>At this point I am taking a break in writing.</p>

<h5 id="17-13-thursday-25-july-2019-jst">17:13 Thursday 25 July 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Main things I would like to look at in our work</p>

<p>Improve my ability to find clients who value my services.  I would
like to make enough money that I can let go of my current programming
job and let my wife feel comfortable in doing work she loves instead
of doing work for money.</p>

<p>I often get feedback that what I said was really helpful or
insightful.  My secret is that it&rsquo;s often channeled information,
though I do not know much about my source.  Would like to learn more
about the source and how to build a relationship with my source.</p>

<p>I have listened to Bashar as channeled by whatshisname (who keeps
saying extraterrestrial disclosure is coming), and have been listening
to Abraham as channeled by Esther Hicks.  I love what you said about
it being simplified.   However, the reason I brought up these channels
is that I have sometimes thought I could do that.  Should I keep it
low-key and just channel as I mentioned above.  As I wrote the
question, the answer came: meet my channelee first.</p>

<p>I feel fear and sadness when I don&rsquo;t pursue this line of questions.  I
want you (or someone, anyone but meeeee) to give me all the answers.
Holy cats maybe that is my sadness of being disconnected from my
channelee.  (is there a word for that? the spirit being channeled?)</p>

<p>When reading the book <em>Shaving The Inside of Your Skull</em>, I created my
own religion, ROBOT (Rob&rsquo;s Own Brand of Teachings), which includes the
concept of EPP, the Ever Present Present.  Why did I even bring that
up with you now?</p>

<p>Improve my skillset in terms of healing.  I have always been
fascinated with astral, and finding your simple structured
introduction has been lovely.  What you say makes sense to my maps and
seems like something I could easily put into practice.</p>

<p>Improve connection in our marriage.  I hide parts of myself from my
wife Lin out of fear of her reaction.</p>

<p>Spend more time on my art projects because they are fun and bring a
lot of joy to me in making and people in seeing.  How can they support
my financial abundance?</p>
