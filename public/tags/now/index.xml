      <description>10:37 Wednesday 20 September 2017 JST I am in famous coffee shop SB in Lazona and have just watched New Rockstars breakdown of Rick and Morty Season 3 episode 7 after compiling a list of 6 phone numbers of men I will call tomorrow morning (tomorrow night for them) to confirm their planned participation in a new set of 6 Virtual Integration Group calls I will be semi-organizing starting in October.</description>

      <description>09:18 Thursday 02 February 2017 JST I&amp;rsquo;m headed home on the Nambu Line because I forgot to bring my books with me for my afternoon lessons. I have as many as 6 30 minute lessons over a 3 hour period, and I like to have my notebook to take notes. But realistically, I can just write notes on separate paper and transcribe it to the notebook later. Part of me wants to look prepared (more than &amp;ldquo;yeah I forgot my notebook again&amp;rdquo;).</description>
