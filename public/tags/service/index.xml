      <description>17:44 Sunday 12 July 2015 JST Lin and I went to softbank to inquire about charges for her iPad whose contract was up last year or so.
They helpfully renewed the contract and charge a fucking fee to get out of it. So while sitting there listening to him explain how it was impossible to do anything about it even though we didn&amp;rsquo;t use the service, I folded one of their A4 size laminated ads, deflated their laptop sized mascot (didn&amp;rsquo;t poke a hole in it, but I thought about it), and changed the calendar from July to October.</description>
