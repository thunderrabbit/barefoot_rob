<p>Today I met with Tariq and Dipendra to talk about ConSwi.  They are
all excited about the graphics and I am in the camp of getting a
minimum viable product out. I want to empower Dipendra to update the
graphics in the app.  He got a copy of Conswi from Github.  Instead of
giving him write access to the app, I had him create his own account
and push to his own ConSwi.</p>

<p>Although it is a fork, I assume it is not counted as a fork from
Github&rsquo;s point of view.  I wonder if that is possible to make happen.
Probably not if it has not been implemented already.</p>

<p>Dang it is 5:30 and already dark.  I remember our 5pm picture in Sao
Paolo was like noon here.</p>

<p>Good lesson this morning with just two students.  We talked about
rental おっさん in Japan.  Interesting concept of renting old men
because they are older and presumably wiser.  They?  We?</p>

<p>Walked with Tariq from Akabanebashi to Shibashi while we talked about
future plans for our
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi">swipe game</a>. He found a
designer who can create excellent graphics.</p>

<p>Did not end up needing my computer, but I have my rolly bag so no
worries.</p>

<p>Rolled to Ginza Line and got back to my station for 411 yen, given
that I have a free pass from Shin Yurigaoka to Noborito.</p>

<p>Woke up early to come out to Kawasaki so I could meet with Oriane,
Cyber Knights, and Court of Support before meeting Tariq at 11:30.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll have a good chunk of time (per my schedule) though I do not know
how much time he will have.</p>

<p>I plan to get some app stuff or AB done today.</p>

<p>Met Tariq to talk about next steps on our game.  My next step is to
see about having a backend we can talk to.  His next step is to design
the progression of levels and think about audio within the game.</p>

<p>Tariq and I have what I hope is an interesting game idea.  That&rsquo;s why
I have been messing with Godot Engine.  Hopefully I can get up to
speed on it soon enough.</p>

<p>We are trying to figure out how to allow users to sell items on the app.</p>

<p class="dream">Making a copy of Tariq's data, I noted a pattern of full backups and
partial backups, so I was able to go back a week to get the most
recent full backup.  The current backup was going to be a full backup,
but it was aborted before it finished.
</p>

<p class="dream">Later, he and I were walking to the train station, and after I crossed
the street, I was like, "hey Tariq over here!" and he turned to follow
and was suddenly hit by a car like blam and instantly dead =
dismembered into blobs of white fat and two wooden egg shapes which
had been his eyes.</p>

<p class="dream">I had a sense that it couldn't be real, but didn't wake up. I was
shocked, and I feared it was my fault, as I had called to him, and he
was killed when he turned to follow me.  Riding in his dad's car, I
called Lin and told her "Tariq is dead!" and also wanted his dad to
understand, so I switched to Japanese "Tariq が死んだ!" and he took
notice and we drove to the location where there was a police vehicle
nearby so we directed him to the scene where some people were picking
up the blobs of fat.  I was too distraught to do anything.
</p>

<p class="dream">
Walking with some people in a new neighborhood, I realized they looked
like gang members, featuring big tattoos, spikey hair, knuckles,
jackets.  I spoke to the toughest looking one and said, "to be honest,
I feel a bit of fear around you guys, even though I know you're just a
bunch of guys.. Your outward appearance reminds me of some stories
I've heard about gang violence."
</p>

<p class="dream">
They were like, "well why don't you come with us?" and more fear came
up in me as they took me into a room.  I realized I was dreaming, but
didn't come fully out of it until I stated the intention that only
good things will happen in my dreams.
</p>

<p>And I woke up out of the dream</p>
