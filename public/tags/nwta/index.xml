      <description>01:10 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT I felt sad to have to check out for a significant portion of the NWTA this past weekend. So annoying, and certainly not what I had in mind for my trip!
Was great to meet awesome men. I stayed with Steve R in Vancouver the night before the weekend, and am now staying with Dave M in Victoria the night after the weekend. Headed to Houston tomorrow via Calgary.</description>

      <description>08:48 Thursday 10 January 2019 JST Men,
Back when I joined Mankind Project in 1997, the New Warrior Training Adventure was the only way to get started in Mankind Project.
Attending the weekend was a life changing experience for me. It was on that weekend that I realized I was a man. It was during that weekend that I began to get over my fear of men.
Over the years, as an organization, Mankind Project has begun encouraging new men to sit in Open Circles (like the one we have in Tokyo) before attending the New Warrior Training Adventure (NWTA).</description>

      <description>11:45 Friday 25 September 2015 JST I&amp;rsquo;m cancelling my plane tickets for Perth.
And getting new ones so I will be in Perth longer!!
After receiving an email detailing the weekend schedule (which starts on Thursday night), I was like O_o at seeing how much container-building I would miss by arriving Friday late morning. &amp;ldquo;Oh shit,&amp;rdquo; so I bit the bullet, asked for help covering my classes, and am about to cough up cash to make it happen.</description>
