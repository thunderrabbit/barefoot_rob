      <description>12:26 Wednesday 27 January 2016 CST We didn&amp;rsquo;t buy an ice cream making ball, and didn&amp;rsquo;t replace my backpack, but Travis(!) printed a receipt for my backpack purchase in San Francisco back in 2011.
We did buy socks, though, especially after the girl with a 1 cm plug in her ear lobe helped check the size by opening up the package for me.
Outside (and inside) Lin took a few pics which I hope the guy from Tokyo TV will be able to use in the broadcast.</description>
