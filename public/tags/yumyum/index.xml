Lin and I are on the train from Paola and Jon&amp;rsquo;s house; we were the only two students in yoga class, so we got all the attention and all the goodies after the lesson. Yummy chicken stew something, several types of cheese + sembe, and a fruit pie with three or four types of fruit jam filling.</description>
