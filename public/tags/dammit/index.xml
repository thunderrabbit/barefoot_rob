      <description>02:02 Monday 12 October 2015 JST HI Ken I have just discovered I made the most amazing fuckup imaginable and cannot teach the lesson on Wednesday. I will try to find somebody to cover it. I&#39;m totally embarrassed because I specifically told you that I don&#39;t fuck around with my schedule like that, and yet I did. I&#39;m sorry, and I know &amp;quot;sorry&amp;quot; is meaningless. I will help find someone to cover it.</description>
