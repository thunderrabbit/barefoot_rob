<p>Honored to be invited to the event! Admired that Rin has connected
lots of people who could easily become friends.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, Rin cried as Hiro predicted. Everyone had a great
time. I friended Chris just because he commented on the FB group.</p>

<p>Talked to him about PB 49 and 52, assuring him I could talk about it
all night (even though 13 years at wow)</p>

<p>Heard about Chris moving from China at age 10 to live in Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Last hug to Diana for now as she&rsquo;s about to head back to her country.
Got two cards from Sophia to hopefully introduce housing for her
company to find homestay families for youth.</p>

<p>Handed out my MKP Japan card like candy even though we are in a
digital world. Two women were like &ldquo;what about womankind project?&rdquo; so
I referred them to womanwithin.org.</p>

<p>Tonight in Azabu Juban I attended Tokyo Tribe&rsquo;s workshop number 8, a
look back at the first half of 2019, and a look forward at the second
half.</p>

<p>Here is what I wrote as testimonial:</p>

<pre><code>I learned I did a great deal in 2019 already and got good insights
on what types of behaviors support my continued growth.

Therefore, I can focus on the helpful behaviors and achieve even
more in the second half of 2019.

I discovered fears from my childhood have kept me from acting in
my highest joy and inner growth

<p>Yesterday I attended my second Tokyo Tribe event, and was invited to
do workshops there after half the people in the workshop said they
benefitted from things I had said during the workshop.</p>

<p>I plan to work with Rin and Hiro to put together my own workshops, and
initially, offer them in conjunction with Tokyo Tribe Jiaii. (I am not
sure of the branding they use, nor the branding I will use, but I
recently bought the domain <a href="https://wanb.us">wanb.us</a> to do my Urbit
Star.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be our own best friends.  Cause we are all just dogs on a bus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rin said she knows a person who does branding.  Strictly speaking, I
do too!  HI Jimmy!</p>

<p>Hiro showed us his daily journal templates, which were written in
Japanese.  I whipped up my own version, and plan to post them under
<a href="/tags/robot-pages">robot-pages</a>
&lt;&ndash; not sure if this URL is correct</p>

<p>後、Rin and Hiro will attend mixed gender group tonight at Christine&rsquo;s
in Nishi Azabu.  Good thing they like cats!</p>
