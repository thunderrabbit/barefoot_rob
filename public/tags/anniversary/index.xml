      <description>11:15 Thursday 04 June 2015 JST My right elbow has been hurting from too much mousing, I think. I got a recommendation from Tariq, via one of his students.
His name is 吉川泰弘 The nearest station is 駒沢大学駅 His clinic&#39;s name is 駒沢病院 His position there is 整形外科部長  I looked up the hospital and it turns out it&amp;rsquo;s the same one where I had my shoulder surgery done 9 years ago.</description>
