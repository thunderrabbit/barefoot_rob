      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard the quote something like
Insanity is repeating the same thing and expecting a different result.  I just realized that I have been trying to apply that quote too strongly in my life. I have low-key assumed I have to make some huge radical change in my life in order to have anything different.
That belief was blocking my ability to make lasting change. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to take on a huge change or multiple changes all at once.</description>

      <description>15:33 Saturday 17 March 2018 JST I think I added four seconds of video today in about an hour and a half. Pretty speedy because at some points only two characters were moving.
  Since June 2017, I have spent 6.3+ days on Marble Track 3.
The resulting videos available via https://mt3s.robnugen.com/ are like 8 minutes 32 seconds long.</description>
