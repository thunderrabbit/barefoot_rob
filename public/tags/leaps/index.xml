      <description>13:21 10 February 2009 My friend Karla recently asked a question about leaps of faith:
*Have you ever jumped off a cliff?* I don&#39;t mean literally. Have you ever taken that leap of faith - left it all behind without knowing where it would lead you. How did it turn out? What were your feelings before and after the jump? How long did it take before you became accustomed to the new life?</description>
