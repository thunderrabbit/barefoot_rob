<p>(not proofread)</p>

<p class=date>Sunday 11 February 1990</p>

<p>I just got back today from the 1990 Dallas Rally.  On Friday I
picked up Fred (my brother) from his house & we met Rick E and Mike O
at 6pm.  We left in Rick's truck shortly afterward.  We got there at
about 10:something & not many people were there.  I got a mesage to
call my mom (She's going to school at SMU, which is very close to the
church).  I called her and she invited me to come see her apartment.
It was neat.  Very small, but neat.  She has a little kitchen sink &
table & couch & her computer where the T.V. would be.  I met her
friend Lilliann ("Lilly Anne - all one word")  She's really nice.  I
played a little bit of Vegas Gambler while they sat on the couch and
watched... That was fun, but the Rally was calling.  So mom took me
back while Lilliann slept on Ma's couch.</p>

<p>
I got back and saw Joy B and Aaron M again (They got there just before I went to Ma's).  Delayna D was there & Mikael the girl was there.  Opening circle was at 2AM.  We all stood up and said something about ourselves.  Jody K was the first to go.  She was sitting beside me.  Just like my very first Rally, I stood up right after she was done.  I said, "I'm not going last."  Then Dallas D, Alva's sister realized she would be last...
<p>
After the circle, I walked around and talked to different people.  Troy S showed me some pictures.. Including the "Brawn Hand Blender" which he gave me today while we at donuts at the end of the Rally.
<p>
Fred sat by Jasmine -- He held her hand the entire weekend.  Joy sat on my shoulders for a while like last year.  I took Mikael's neat bracelet & wore it for a while.  Delayna and I sat and talked about old times.. Including about Dustin & all those from ConCon 1988.  Delayna & I slept beside each other at about 3:30AM.  We slept till about 7AM.
<p>
We all had pancakes for breakfast.  While standing in line for the pancakes I met Chris - a little guy who I believe is blind or mostly blind.  I helped him get his pancakes & sausage -- & I got him some OJ.  After breakfast I sat with him for a while --I didn't know if he would be ok alone or what.  I finally decided he would be.  I asked if he would-He was..
<p>
For the first workshop I went to Youth Power.  The guy told us how we could do things that would benefit society.  Things that didn't take lots of brains, but very helpful... Like build parks or clean up trash or volunteer in a hospital or whatever.  It was a neat workshop. 
<p>
We had sandwiches for lunch that day - bologna & cheese & ham & mayo.  No lettuce or tomato though... oh well.  Oh - I put chips on mine.  I had 3 sandwiches.  I needed the energy for Ultimate frisbee which we played just after lunch.
<p>
Oh- just before lunch I went to the YMCA with Aaron M to take showers.  I didn't bring my towel so I used his.  I watched some guys play racquetball for a while afterward.  They were good...
<p>
After lunch we went to the YMCA field to play frisbee.  There were some guys already there playing football.  Since we both wanted the whole field, one of the football guys & me & Aaron & someone else who I don't remember his name (he did the meditation workshop..) went into the office to see who would have to go.  The girl there didn't know & she called "Ed" who apparently ran the Y.  He said the church had the field.  Yay!  Me and Aaron thought we were just the baddest dudes in the world after that.  As we walked out he casually put his hand behind him & we gave eachother five.
<p>
Ultimate frisbee was great.  It had rained, so the field was just the right amount of soft.  I made a couple of spectacular catches- one where I jumped way up over a guy & snagged it before he caught it.  It was a totally great game.  I ran & ran & ran.
<p>
After that was the second set of workshops.  I went to the meditation.  I really really relaxed during that.  It was great.  I fell asleep for only a little bit of it.
<p>
After that I went out to the swings with Aaron & Delayna & Joy & Jennifer B (I think that's her name) That was neat.  I got up on the swing set & walked across the bar.  I didn't even fall.. I climbed 3 of the trees out there.  They were pretty good climbing trees.  One had very pokin' bark & it hurt my feet though.
<p>
At one point we went out to the wall & waved at all the cars.  The highlights were the Porsches & BMWs & Mercedes.. The highlight of the highlights was "<em>Lamborghini!!</em>"<br>
We all jumped off the wall - yelling & waving as we ran toward the sidewalk.  The guy saw us & revved up his engine.  The sound was beautiful.  So powerful & cool.  Vroo- Vroo- VROOOOOOOOM!!!  It was completely kick ass awesome.  It was a beautiful red Lamborghini - forgive me for not knowing what model...
<p>
Oh- we quit waving to cars after one driver <b>bumped</b> a van because he was watching us & not the road... 
<p>After workshops & cars & stuff I was part of a circle in the hallway - we did some ohms & then I suggested that we play the squeeze game - I got in the middle & tried to locate a hand squeeze that went around the circle.  I never could find it... So we played the telephone game.  I started the first one: "Three men & a monkey went hunting in the forest with a rainbow."<br>
When it got around, it was something about some people in a parking lot.
<p>
The next one was started - something about pink converse tennis shoes.  Maybe it was, "I bought some ham in my pink converse."  It got around to me: "I will not eat green eggs & sperm I am Sam, Sam I am."  Wow.
<p>
After that Mike A's band was playing.  We went to see them.  It was pretty cool.  They played a big variety of stuff.  Including, "I'm an airplane" & one with a neat neat drum beat.
<p>
After the concert we had the talent show.  It was great.  I did the Fairy Tale with Mike A and I drew a picture of Mike O.  I also sold some Coke (Coca Cola) to Fred.  It was funny.  Carrie did a great mime, "locked in a box".  After the concert I sat with Jennifer and Aaron and Joy and Mikael and we talked and took turns listening to a super cool CD of Aaron's.  It was a German group - I forget their name.  The song was a series of synthesized drum beats in stereo-  cool cool stuff.
<p>
That night I slept alone from 4 to 7AM.  I got up after dying for a few minutes from being so so so so sore. I cleaned up my stuff & then went to closing circle.
<p>
We sang Dear Friends & Yogi Bear & Plastic Jesus & Halls of LRY.  We then did a couple of Colorado hugs on my suggestion, & then we did a spiral - Shane's suggestion.  With 90 people - that got complicated.  But we did it and it was fun.
<p>
We then had donuts outside & exchanged last hugs and goodbyes. I really didn't want to go.  Troy gave me the Brawn Hand Blender picture -  I gave him my address.. I wonder what will happen... Joy told me not to write her - she would write me.  I promised a letter to Jennifer and Delayna.  I hugged everyone again and again.  
<p>
I saw Aaron.  We hugged & I was saying, "shit man..."  No words... I didn't want to go.  I'm going to miss everyone... We left, though.  Rick drove the entire way.  
<p>
We only stopped once - for gas.  Fred and Mike slept all the way; I slept about 1/2 the way.  We got to the church and I put on a name tag: "Hello I'm <b>TIRED</b>."  It was great.</p>

                        <p class=note>(transcribed 6:35pm CST Saturday 25 January 2003)</p>

<p class=date>8:15am Saturday 11 April 1987</p>

<p>We got here at 12:30 this morning during opening ceremony.  We sang
songs and went around the circle telling our names, where we were from
and stuff.  We split up after the rules and I played hackey sack,
frisbee, and Margaret and I had a pillow fight with a big dude named
Monte.  We worked on a puzzle and I slept at 4:00AM.  Woke up at 8:00
It's 8:25.</p>

<p class=date>April 11 1987</p>

<p>I washed up this morning in a sink.  We ate breakfast.  I helped
clean up with Catheryn, Shay, and Jennie.  Then we played butts
up. Catheryn liked it.  I was surprised.  Then we went inside and
threw a super ball around in the main room.  That was fun.  About 12
people chasing a stupid ball can get exciting.  Then we had lunch.
After that me, Catheryn, Shay, and Jennie did a half-ass job of
cleaning.  Then we were going to sleep in the chapel instead of do
workshops.  We decided not to since we weren't supposed to.  So we
went to art workshop.  I made a thing that says, "Ted's Room No Live
Cats" Then it has a peace symbol below it.  Then we played butts up
again. I got the ball stuck way up high in an air vent on the wall.
So we quit and went over to a playground for a while. That was
nice. We got to talk some then we had supper. Then we had a little
service thing.  We were all lying around and this lady was sitting in
a chair.  We all said what we had to say if we wanted. It was like
telling the editor of a paper what's on your mind.  She would add to
it or say something about it if she wanted. Then we tied-dyed.  I did
a T shirt and some underwear. I'm wearing the undies now. Then we went
to Rocky Horror. At first I was just going to wear my hair back and
ragged out clothes. As I was getting ready, everyone else was. But
then I finished and everyone else kept on. Hair was going crazy, faces
were painted, sexy clothes went on. People were all asking, "that all
you gonna do?"  I finally figured I didn't have enough. That's when I
met Kelly Hugget.  Her hair was all crazy, and she was giving this
dude a big hair spike. I asked her to do my hair and she said sure. As
I was waiting, Shay put eyeliner on me.  Then Kelly was done and she
was trying to figure out what to do with mine. Then she said, "Liberty
Spikes!" I was all yeah!  Then she did it. I looked awesome. Everyone
that saw me was saying, "cool man! that's great!" My dad saw it and he
tripped. He got the camera and everything and started clickin'. Then I
was done.  The spikes were bullet proof. Tough dudes. Then I got an
ankh and a pentogram on my cheeks. Then we went. I went with Catheryn,
Shay, and Jennie. It was pretty cool. I stood out so much that one of
the cast asked me how many times I had done it. I lied, "one," and she
looked surprised. She probably thought I was an old timer to
these. She needed more cast members to help her do it. I lied 'cause I
thought she wanted to sell me as a virgin. No way would I do that. But
all the virgins just went up to the front and got taught the
Time-Warp. Then we yelled "Virgins!" at them. I thought the movie was
cool but it got bad reviews from the real non-virgins. Oh well. We got
back and had initiations. Most of them were dull. There were a few
good ones though. At first we did one at a time. Then two. The last
one was 3 people. I initiated the last pair. I had my Spikes and some
dumb little glasses on.  I almost cracked up. Troy wanted to do the
last with three people.  Kelly was one of the singles that got
initiated.  When she was done, I sorta motioned for her to come to me.
She sat beside me, and we started talking.  We got closer and
closer... All the time she was telling me about her adventures in the
"waiting" room. She was telling me how she tried to get out and how
she got everyone to jump the doorman.  I said I could have contained
her.  She asked how and i said I would lie on her or something.  Hint,
Hint. Initiations finished at about 2:30AM. After that Kelly washed
the stuff out of my hair.  As she was doing this, I told her about my
canoe adventure during spring break. Then she washed her hair.  We
were walking around for a while trying to figure out if we wanted to
sleep or have fun.  We went outside awhile and I started to tell her
about my entire Spring Break, not just canoeing.  The she got cold, so
we went inside to the hall.  I finished telling her about my Spring
Break.  When we first went into the hall, we sat side by side with our
backs on the wall. As we talked, I turned to lean against her
shoulder.  Then I lay my head on her leg and she played with my hair.
My dad walked by a few times.  Joel went by once and turned the lights
off as he left.  He said, "just kidding" and turned them back on.  We
said "no, that's alright" and he left them off.  Then we both lay down
on our sides facing eachother...real close.  We told some jokes, then
she got her sleeping bag.  I was lying on my back when she returned.
She put it over me and got under lying on her stomach so that we could
kiss.  We were Frenching awhile and then I pulled her on top of me
completely.  We kept on and on.  Then she rolled us both over so I was
on top.  We kept going and we just fell asleep.  Not that it was
boring.  We got about 30 minutes of sleep from 6:30 to 7:00. We woke
up and dazed for a while.  I fell asleep for a bit and woke up when
she kissed me on the cheek.  I smiled and she smiled back.  I know she
liked that night.  Then we got up, washed up, and started to pack
up. I took some pictures of everyone. I got some business cards to put
addresses on. I got Shay's, Cathryn's, and Jennie's.  I sat in a chair
waiting for Kelly to come by so I could get hers.  I saw her and
motioned for her to comve over.  She did and sat in my lap.  I gave
her a card and asked for her address.  She wrote Ted Nugen down and I
ended up giving her mine.  She wrote hers on the 3 cards I had... Her
name on one, address on the 2nd, and City/state on 3rd.  People
started congregating in the YRUU room, so we went too. We sang some
stuff, Troy did a little thing that cracked me up. He put his palm
down on the floor and with his other hand he "wound" his thumb
up. Then he let go and his hand started flipping back and forth. It
was hilarious. I heard a few good jokes, and then we were all called
outside for closing ceremony. We got in a big circle and sang our
songs, did Colorado hug, yelled Bish Bish, and got pictures taken. I
had to leave soon after that. I hugged everyone and promised
letters. I forgot that I was still wearing a ring a leather bracelet
of Kelly's.  Then I left, wearing my tie dyed underwear over my pants.
I slept about 5 hours on the way home.  Jenny Venier and Emily Kerman
went with us.  When i got home, Kelly had called, asking for her ring
and bracelet back.  I called her, and we talked awhile.  She said she
was going to GA and SWUUSI She said she would try to come to the
Houston Rally.  I said I would write her a big letter along with her
ring and bracelet.</p>
