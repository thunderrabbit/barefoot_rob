Sunday 11 February 1990
I just got back today from the 1990 Dallas Rally. On Friday I picked up Fred (my brother) from his house &amp; we met Rick E and Mike O at 6pm. We left in Rick&#39;s truck shortly afterward. We got there at about 10:something &amp; not many people were there. I got a mesage to call my mom (She&#39;s going to school at SMU, which is very close to the church).</description>

We got here at 12:30 this morning during opening ceremony. We sang songs and went around the circle telling our names, where we were from and stuff. We split up after the rules and I played hackey sack, frisbee, and Margaret and I had a pillow fight with a big dude named Monte. We worked on a puzzle and I slept at 4:00AM.</description>
