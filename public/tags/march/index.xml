      <description>21:46 Sunday 03 March 2019 JST  I will be traveling to the US for 22 days starting March 13th. Not packed yet, but have it planned for next week. I have just sent a list of workshops to Tokyo Men&amp;rsquo;s Circle
Men, my stretch was to find workshops that we can do in Tokyo.
I have led #1 and #3 below. As a group, we did #2 in August 2018 for ourselves, and then again in November 2018 for new men.</description>

      <description>00:34 Thursday 22 March 2018 JST It snowed &amp;ldquo;today&amp;rdquo; and was 2 degrees C all day long. It&amp;rsquo;s apparently going up to 16 or 18 degrees C tomorrow.
I chatted with Delayna who I&amp;rsquo;ve known since our mutual YRUU days back in late 1980s, culminating with ConCon 1988. Looking forward to seeing her herb business grow!</description>
