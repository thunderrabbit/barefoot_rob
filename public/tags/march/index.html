<ol>
<li>I will be traveling to the US for 22 days starting March 13th.</li>
<li>Not packed yet, but have it planned for next week.</li>

<li><p>I have just sent a list of workshops to Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle</p>

<p>Men, my stretch was to find workshops that we can do in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I have led #1 and #3 below.  As a group, we did #2 in August 2018
for ourselves, and then again in November 2018 for new men.</p>

<p>#4 can be done online, once a week for 5 to 7 weeks (2 hours per
 week).  This would require some coordination and a trainer from
 the US to help me lead.  I judge it would take a committment from
 6 men to make it worthwhile.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Head Heart and Soul is a 2 hour introduction to the work.  Men
and women can attend.</p></li>

<li><p>Circle of Men, Journey of the Heart is a day long experiential
personal growth workshop.  Men only, but could probably work
for women.  (6-7 hours, including lunch)</p></li>

<li><p>Life Mission workshop lets each man to discover his lifeâ€™s
Mission, and actions which he can use to bring his mission
present in his life.  This can easily be done in 2 hours.</p></li>

<li><p>Circle Skills training for the classic archetypal MKP-style
integration circle (this gives a solid framework for sitting in
circle)</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>I got a new battery, but it has not worked right.  I understand now I
need to disable sleep mode and let it reallllly run out all the
way.  Dangit.</p></li>

<li><p>Marble Track 3 has over 300 hours of livestream of me making it.</p></li>

<li><p>I probably will not mess with the website for a bit, but the idea
of making it better is tempting.</p></li>

<li><p>The website is at version 2, mostly purple and made by Sanjay and
team in Deli, India.</p></li>

<li><p>The GoFundMe has made $4000+ which more than covers the tickets for my
trip.  We need to set up a company here to keep track of
everything.</p></li>

<li><p>That means I need to start collecting receipts, cause they are
getting pricey!</p></li>

<li><p>I had a killer headache this past Monday from too much
computering, I think.  I can feel another coming on, but I will
head to be soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I am shutting my computer down now/soon and will let the battery run alll the way down</p></li>

<li><p>I think I have a way to fix ConSwi without relying on physics to
keep bricks from going through each other.</p></li>

<li><p>I wanted to work on it today, but did lots of MKP stuff</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It snowed &ldquo;today&rdquo; and was 2 degrees C all day long.  It&rsquo;s apparently
going up to 16 or 18 degrees C tomorrow.</p>

<p>I chatted with Delayna who I&rsquo;ve known since our mutual YRUU days back
in late 1980s, culminating with
<a href="https://new.robnugen.com/journal/1988/08/23/concon/">ConCon 1988</a>. Looking
forward to seeing her
<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/nbc6n6u4">herb business</a> grow!</p>
