<p>This morning Colleen woke me up at 6:40 as I hoped to leave by 7am for
the airport.  I was shocked to know Ryan had already left; I didn&rsquo;t
notice him at all while I was sleeping.</p>

<p>I am grateful that Colleen woke me up after I had not set an alarm or
anything; I was just able to conk out asleep last night and she
handled all the details.</p>

<p>Traffic was super smooth toward the airport and smooth experience from
baggage check-in out on the curb to quite polite TSA agents in through
the gates.  Thank you, SEA-TAC!</p>

<p>Akiko and I went to her train line&rsquo;s side of Akihabara, and ate at the
Indian restaurant on the 9th floor of the BIC Camera building.
Bottomless cheese nan seems like a good deal until I eat the second
one!</p>

<p>We talked about her upcoming trip overseas and pets and other stuff I
am too tired to remember, much less write.  Oh, we also talked about
commas and when to use them.  Tough question!</p>

<p>Her Japanese teacher told her to add 、 when she wanted to say ね.
That&rsquo;s as good as most rules I&rsquo;ve heard for commas in English.</p>

<p>These are notes she wrote in the last three lessons.</p>

<p>Well, I missed the first day of the month by 3 minutes.  I have been
zoned out in front of my computer longer than 3 minutes so oh well.</p>

<p>Logged 6 hours of work and noticed how much longer it will take.  At
10 minutes per line, and 400 more lines to change that&rsquo;s 4000 minutes
(hopefully max!), but that is just to get rid of a single singleton.</p>

<p>I am tired enough that I cannot do the math in my head.  4000 minutes
/ 60 = 65 hours..  dang that has got to be too much.  5 minutes per
line and we get 32 hours.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main point is that I feel shame for mis-guessing how long
it would take.  But I gotta let AB know the estimate.</p>

<p>I think I will start up their new DB server and use the existing web
server and new DB server for a bit, and then spin up new DB server
with Ubuntu 18.</p>

<p>Great Integration Group tonight after meeting a potential new man.  He
has been in Tokyo for 6 months and may join on the first week of
June.  Met another man who has already attended [New Warrior Training
Adventure]() so we welcomed him into the circle tonight.</p>

<p>Just watched a couple episodes of Rick and Morty on Netflix.  From
season 1, the Zigerian scammers, and then the Mr Needful half of the
Pluto episode (, fast forwarding through the Pluto parts).</p>

<p>This was after Japanese lesson with Mel, who often gives me bonus time
yay!  We read a few pages of a Doraemon book with 100 four-kanji words.</p>

<p>All that was after eating chocolate on the way home from the station
after reading <em>Planet on Purpose</em> after talking to Yoko after the
lesson after receiving the remainder of the chocolate rabbit she
brought to class after she arrived late after we had been talking
about <em>Planet on Purpose</em> after talking about Skype after having
talked about the lesson from last week after Mayumi asked me about it
after not having been there then.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s lesson started after I helped some people from Atlanta Georgia
charge their Suica after I charged my own card after arriving in
Akihabara after taking the train from Kawasaki after buying a bottle
of milk tea after noting it came with a chipmunk character (from Chip
and Dale) <em>inside</em> an adjacent bottle after going into the shop after
having finished four lessons at the SCC, including tweaking some
translation about a new exhibit, after learning that &ldquo;exhibit&rdquo; in
Japanese is てんじ, though I am not sure of its spelling.</p>

<p>I had gone to SCC after reading <em>Planet on Purpose</em> on the train after
leaving home after working on ConSwi after attending the Court of
Support meeting after checking in and out of my Integration Group,
&ldquo;Cyber Knights&rdquo; after having breakfast after Lin made it after we woke
up.</p>

<p>After my morning lesson I had a big gap during which I had a big nap
because dang I was tired.  I seem to have gotten over the <em>jet lag</em>
(new vocabulary word for some students today).  I was roused by a
security guard when I tried to nap on a grassy field on 3F of Lazona
(next to Eggs N Things (or something)).  But before he roused me, I
got to sleep there about an hour or so, so that was nice.</p>

<p>They are putting a new green fake grass surface in Lazona, to give it
a (fake) park-like atmosphere.  It looks nice; I wonder how functional
it will be.</p>

<p>Headed to JB at 3:30 and just finished a bit ago.  7pm lesson featured
a discussion of WTC7, and 8pm lesson featured intonation practice.
How are you?  How are <em>you</em>?</p>

<p>Heh.  Well, it was pretty great.  Dirk Gently&rsquo;s Holistic Detective
Agency was good enough that I just watched the last four (4) episodes
in a row.  At 40+ minutes each that&rsquo;s 160+ minutes or about oh my god
I have to go to bed.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t tagged a journal entry as &lsquo;sleepy&rsquo; in a while.  Tonight we
saw a movie and when I turned my phone back on I discovered I had
derped an online meeting by not entering it into my calendar (nor my
brain, obviously).  Got the meeting sorted out after returning home,
and she was understanding / comforting enough that I probably won&rsquo;t
offer lunch or anything.</p>

<p>Anyway, I cleaned up the
<a href="https://thunderrabbit.github.io/balance-differ/">Balance Differ</a> a
little so it has less code related to the Time Calculator.  The writer
of Time Calculator hasn&rsquo;t responded to my request for a suggested
License, so I guess I will leave the license off.</p>

<p>Just for the record, I am completely ready for bed: showered,
flossed+brushed teeth, dried hair (doesn&rsquo;t take much)&hellip; but I am just
sitting in front of my computer like bluh. gtf to bed!</p>
