This morning Colleen woke me up at 6:40 as I hoped to leave by 7am for the airport. I was shocked to know Ryan had already left; I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice him at all while I was sleeping.
I am grateful that Colleen woke me up after I had not set an alarm or anything; I was just able to conk out asleep last night and she handled all the details.</description>

      <description>Crud I am falling asleep here in a mildew-stricken cafe near the cigarette-smoked Infinity Books. I&amp;rsquo;ll go upstairs and see if it is better and if I can snooze a bit.
Still not fixed my site indicies yet. blarg</description>

      <description>23:05 Thursday 11 July 2019 JST Akiko and I went to her train line&amp;rsquo;s side of Akihabara, and ate at the Indian restaurant on the 9th floor of the BIC Camera building. Bottomless cheese nan seems like a good deal until I eat the second one!
We talked about her upcoming trip overseas and pets and other stuff I am too tired to remember, much less write. Oh, we also talked about commas and when to use them.</description>

      <description>00:03 Tuesday 02 July 2019 JST Well, I missed the first day of the month by 3 minutes. I have been zoned out in front of my computer longer than 3 minutes so oh well.
Logged 6 hours of work and noticed how much longer it will take. At 10 minutes per line, and 400 more lines to change that&amp;rsquo;s 4000 minutes (hopefully max!), but that is just to get rid of a single singleton.</description>

      <description>00:54 Friday 06 April 2018 JST Just watched a couple episodes of Rick and Morty on Netflix. From season 1, the Zigerian scammers, and then the Mr Needful half of the Pluto episode (, fast forwarding through the Pluto parts).
This was after Japanese lesson with Mel, who often gives me bonus time yay! We read a few pages of a Doraemon book with 100 four-kanji words.
All that was after eating chocolate on the way home from the station after reading Planet on Purpose after talking to Yoko after the lesson after receiving the remainder of the chocolate rabbit she brought to class after she arrived late after we had been talking about Planet on Purpose after talking about Skype after having talked about the lesson from last week after Mayumi asked me about it after not having been there then.</description>

      <description>21:12 Wednesday 14 March 2018 JST After my morning lesson I had a big gap during which I had a big nap because dang I was tired. I seem to have gotten over the jet lag (new vocabulary word for some students today). I was roused by a security guard when I tried to nap on a grassy field on 3F of Lazona (next to Eggs N Things (or something)).</description>

      <description>02:29 Saturday 13 January 2018 JST Heh. Well, it was pretty great. Dirk Gently&amp;rsquo;s Holistic Detective Agency was good enough that I just watched the last four (4) episodes in a row. At 40+ minutes each that&amp;rsquo;s 160+ minutes or about oh my god I have to go to bed.

      <description>23:49 Friday 20 October 2017 JST I haven&amp;rsquo;t tagged a journal entry as &amp;lsquo;sleepy&amp;rsquo; in a while. Tonight we saw a movie and when I turned my phone back on I discovered I had derped an online meeting by not entering it into my calendar (nor my brain, obviously). Got the meeting sorted out after returning home, and she was understanding / comforting enough that I probably won&amp;rsquo;t offer lunch or anything.</description>

      <description>00:46 Wednesday 02 November 2016 JST &amp;ldquo;Today&amp;rdquo; I spent about 5 hours working on a rewrite of some code that worked back when there were 40k records, but isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as good with 90k records. Not a huge difference, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to make the number of records not matter any more.
Also sorted out the details for a new shirt coming soon to a TV near anyone who watches a lot of TV in Japan.</description>

      <description>01:29 Sunday 12 April 2015 JST I posted this at https://answers.unity3d.com/questions/945007/programmatically-added-sliderjoint2d-not-respected.html
How can I make sprites fall straight down, and resist any sideways motion whether by dragging or physics?
My code instantiates a prefab at runtime which has an attached script.
The script runs the following function after a while:
void addSliderJoint() { myVerticalSlider = gameObject.AddComponent&amp;lt;SliderJoint2D&amp;gt; () as SliderJoint2D; myVerticalSlider.angle = 90; }  After this functions runs, I&amp;rsquo;d like the sprites to only move vertically, but they seem happy to move without restriction.</description>

Out in the field, we did meditation, then a visualization to show the ETs where we are located.
We saw a few falling stars, but nothing else obvious.
I&amp;rsquo;m writing now because I just came back to the cabin to get the main laser pointer.
##02:55 Sunday 23 November 2014 JST##
We just arrived back in our cabin. Saw lots of flashes in the sky, like the whole sky lit up just for a twentieth or 100th of a second, about maybe 20 times over the course of nearly 5 hours we were out there.</description>

Really tired. Fell asleep on each train home. Yuuko didn&#39;t, so I didn&#39;t miss any stations on the way to Yokohama. I had to watch for Tsunashima by myself, and I was successful. Nice. Oh shit I almost just fell asleep before I wrote nice; I was thinking about having to stay awake for the train and fell asleep thinking about staying awake. Weird enough.</description>

Oh my god.
How did it become midnight already?
I learned that the IRS is overbudget and well delayed in upgrading their computer system, but they&#39;ll be screwed soonishly as the old cats who know the old system are going to retire soon.
I looked through some of the mysterious files in my file system to see what I can see. I renamed the OS 9 folder to see if I really need it.</description>

I really like his wife&#39;s spoken Japanese; I don&#39;t know if she speaks more clearly or if I am suddenly understanding more, but it seems that I can pick up more of her spoken words than other peoples&#39;.
Ummmmm we took the train to his house (over an hour from ����) and he cooked a rockin&#39; dinner! janette *totally* would love this; the house is full of quirky stuff and not at all like a stuffy clean house that I thought most (but what the heck do I know, this is the first Japanese home I&#39;ve been to) Japanese homes might be.</description>

Studied a tiny bit. I&#39;ve got to wean myself off GTA3 and internet. I&#39;ve done well with getting off the internet recently. Well, weller than before. Matty is going to sell the TV and playstation soon.

Tonight was a crazy filled night with Frank, Peter, Matty, Chris, Gbenga (pronounced &#34;benga&#34;), Atsuko (pronounced &#34;liz&#34;), Megumi, Daiske, Sorie and her husband at Korean Barbecue.
My head is a bit tired from all the inanity. (not insanity)
Daiske sculled 2 beers, each in like 5 seconds flat. Chris (a Kiwi) encouraged it.
Peter has turned a new corner and hasn&#39;t had alcohol in almost a month.</description>

Rode the train home with Morag after work. Chatted with her, got an overview of her life history. From Scotland but raised in Canada. Went back to Scotland for three months to waitress, then home for five weeks and now out here.
Hung out with Miki in Musashi-Kosugi after that. With a little bit of thought, we were able to come up with 40 kanji that I know!</description>

janette saw that I took a photograph of a cute blonde while we were in Kyoto and now we are breaking up.
What a dumb photograph. Can&#39;t even fucking see the girl in it except that she&#39;s blonde. What a dumb idea to take her photo. Fuck.
We talked about it, and it seems that I don&#39;t want to have a girlfriend because I want to do everything alone.</description>

Went to a river. Saw no monkeys. Ate vanilla and green tea softo cream. Did see three guys in truncated kayaks. Saw some babies tears moss. Surprise/spider lillies. Saw a giant tent that turned out to be white sheeting hiding a well tower. Ate om rice at a little out-of-the-crowd cafe.
The train going back was cheaper, faster and less crowded than the bus going there.</description>

I know a day has been full or lazy or distracting or both if the first entry is a sleep entry.
Rode bikes with janette. My pedal fell off. May need to replace it sooner than planned. 7500 yen for a new crankset. Sigh.
Went to Miho&#39;s with janette. Mmmmmmmm.
Went shopping with janette. She yammered with .. wait that was yesterday I think.</description>

Wooooo
Awesome. Put my bike together tonight and rode around with janette. Saw Jon M (who is living with Olivia and Jen for his last few days in Japan) on the way out of Bell Wistaria. My bike felt weird at first, but by the end of the evening, while janette was stuck in a median waiting for highway traffic to go by, I zoomed up over and down the highway on the pedestrian ramp thing.</description>

Good Nova-bashing tonight at the ol&#39; 101. Dan just finished his OJT today; Matty and I traded punches at Nova&#39;s material. Matty had a bit more to say than I do; I think he knows the book more. Nah, not really, but he was really funny about the fuckin&#39; Everyday Conversation lessons.

Tried quite diligently to hack into Steve&#39;s website, but wasn&#39;t able to. Trying to figure out how to set up a BBST on my site. Tantalizingly close to directories I need to see, but nope.
Tonight was Carla&#39;s birthday party. Lyle bet me 300 yen I couldn&#39;t do 60 pushups in 5 minutes. Eric did 47. I did 44. Benny did 60 in less than 5 minutes.</description>

Ah geez! Stupid morning!
In the process of going to bed, I saw that Frank was watching _Red Dragon_. Ah. Red Dragon. So I watched it with him.
Now as I&#39;m going to bed, it&#39;s fully light outside!

Frank says that he should have just killed himself and be done with it. &#34;That&#39;s a much more interesting ending - choosing to end his serial killer career for love.</description>

Good job studying.
I had a revelation of sorts.
just get the vocab in my head and don&#39;t worry as much about grammar.
I&#39;m tired enough to fall asleep right now, but I&#39;ll probably call janette for a bedtime story.

Three things:
(zero) Agreed with Jon L to give a level four student level up to level three. She was quite happy and passed the test rather well. The level 3 test is rather difficult, according to Steve.
(ichi) Had a great 7C student to close out the day. Her name is Kazue, and she&#39;s a computer engineer of some variety. Part of the reason I liked her is she remindes me of someone else, but I can&#39;t remember who.</description>

Today I noticed that it&#39;s the people who do things differently that get noticed. Those who are willing to go against the grain. Apparently I want to be noticed, which is why I keep wondering about this. So I don&#39;t want to go against the grain like Eminem and diss everybody and everything. I&#39;d like to go against the grain more like Ghandi, but I don&#39;t know anything about him really except he somehow got a bunch of cats to not fight against those who wanted to fight them.</description>

Sigh.
I missed OKC Rally. OKC is my favorite rally besides Houston. And Houston is my favorite only because Jason and I planned it for some years in a row and made it kick major ass.
OKC is my favorite rally because of fantastic memories of OKC 1987 and the church is a coooool shape for Sardines and awesome Silent Football memories and because I learned the secret to Ceiling Wall Floor at OKC.</description>

Studied for some hours and then got sidetracked with Nine Inch Nails music in my head, specifically the end of &#34;Perfect Drug.&#34;
During my sidetrackedness, I&#39;ve just created a nin compilation for Jackie, who expressed interest in nin music some weeks ago on LJ. I love nin so I want to encourage her appreciation of the music.
My intentions for tomorrow:
!) That I go to the police box and they&#39;ll have my wallet @) If no wallet, I&#39;ll go to the bank and get cash #) Regardless of walletification, I&#39;ll buy a new chain-wallet $) Meet Koko at international lounge and embark with her: %) if no old wallet, to get a new gaijin card ^) bicycle recovery mission, no matter how many wallets I&#39;ve got.</description>

Crud. I didn&#39;t realize how late it is.
I&#39;ve been reading/writing email, listening to iTunes (working on a playlist for a CD I&#39;ll burn for work) and I did laundry. Didn&#39;t study Japanese tonight.
I&#39;m kinda stuck in that mode of oh-god-I-have-too-much-to-do-so-where-do-I-start and instead of starting just get sidetracked. Ah well.
But I gotta go to bed so I can get up and embark on a new adventure at Nova with the correct shoes which of course I&#39;ll need cause my bike is awol.</description>

I have a sneaking suspicion that as soon as I get out of here (internet cafe) I&#39;m going to remember that which I feel like I&#39;m forgetting. Oh I remember one thing.
Okay. I hope that was it.

Tiiiiired.
Janelle looks a lot like woman from Something about Mary. DAmn that&#39;s how tired I am; I can&#39;t think of her name.
We got phones after work. I have a phone now. I don&#39;t have the number memorized, and it&#39;s way across the room so I&#39;m not going to get it now.
The phone has a camera on it and so many features that I couldn&#39;t even figure out how to save names on it, nor even how to make a phone call!</description>

So Austin Rally is kicking it and I&#39;m still awake.
But I&#39;m not at the rally; I was at work until now. Bluh. Well at least that will help me bling bling it some. I should make like $150 from today.
Clocked in at 10:47 AM and out at 3:36 AM or so.

Been emailing/phoning with Fred; he&#39;s helping me some with my website. I&#39;m trying to set up a cool way to basically prepend my navigation buttons at the top of my pages. I&#39;m trying a technique of using a script that takes as a parameter the requested dir/ectory/file.html that a person wants, writes the navigation buttons, then writes the results of a GET request of my own site of that directory and filename.</description>

Allison came by today looking for Sean. She chatted with Jack and I for a bit. Said she broke up with her boyfriend, and that she is rather excited to be back in New York soon, her first time to be there and be single all at once.
Her hairdye color is Manic Panic&#39;s Deadly Nightshade, I think. Wow; what a name.

Josephine helped me with dishes by drying those that I washed and rinsed. I&#39;m thankful for her help. I asked Janette not to help, which she found difficult. As difficult as getting Joey to help, maybe..
I&#39;m really thankful for the space that Janette has created here, allowing everyone to hang out in a safe, fun, loving environment. I&#39;m specifically thankful that she allows me to just be here in this space, paying only by doing odd jobs around the house.</description>

Well, I&#39;ve driven almost an hour; I wonder how close I am to the rest area. I&#39;m too tired to care; I&#39;m parked in the parking lot of a topless club that is deserted. No tops, no customers, no nothing except a bunch of 18 wheelers parked nearby to sleep. I&#39;m out of their way I hope.
5868 miles since Dallas. About 600 miles driven today.</description>

Got back from Santa Monica at 8pm, and Rick came over for grilled burgers (Morning Star veggie burgers for me) and chillin&#39;
Sally and I watched Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I hadn&#39;t previously seen it. My favorite scene is when the princess reveals herself to be Invincible Sword Princess or something. Nice.</description>

Sock Monkey dialed first with his right paw. No answer. He flew around like supermonkey while the phone rang. Then he dialed with his tail, just for variety. No answer. (No variety.)
So Socks, Scott and I are going to go sleep down at that winding road by the bay. I&#39;m thankful to have found it.

Okay. Status: 1917 miles traveled so far. I&#39;ve been awake since 5:05am MST, so that&#39;s basically 23 hours.</description>

In my room, there used to be boxes in the unused bathtub and no window treatment in the bathroom. The toilet and sink did work, though; that was enough for me.
But now I find that the bathtub has been cleared out, a thoughtful curtain put up, and even flowers in a small vase on the sink. Beautiful. I&#39;m really thankful to live here.</description>

Finally I&#39;ve gotten to see where Steve lives. And Hillary and Bethany and Kathy.
Hillary showed us her beautiful glass pieces that she&#39;s blown. She has made three cups, two of them with colors, and two bowls, one of them clear.
Her first cup cracked a big crack down the inside, so she affected a cracked pattern on the whole thing and resealed it. Amazing.</description>

I&#39;m watching Comedy Central now. Standup comedy. Heehee.
Tamara just came home and offered to let me sleep on the bed in the room behind her room. Awesome. Plus it has internet access so I can read google news and livejournal.
11:55pm
I just watched Porn N Chicken, Comedy Central&#39;s first original movie. Cute, and interesting that the main character&#39;s big finale was to drive to California with no agenda.</description>

I want to eat. But actually I just feel sad and want to eat to block that emotion. I&#39;m sad about not going to San Antonio Rally. I&#39;m going to miss you guys like crazy.
I&#39;m sad that I can&#39;t tell you why I can&#39;t go. I fucked up and pissed some people off and now I&#39;m not going. I&#39;ve been asked to also not attend Houston Rally.</description>

Josh doesn&#39;t live nearby, so Joana and I went upstairs to someone else&#39;s suite (Brent and Greg?) where some people were studying, and some were zombified by the TV and/or pot. Once the studiers quit studying (not that they finished, but they were all, &#34;</description>

Super tired. I&#39;ve been up reading a ton of livejournal entries, and then reading my email via yahoo. Message from Steve Feinstein says he has heard rumors that some people are concerned about me not having a church that I&#39;m affiliated with and not having youth to bring to the rally, but me still wanting to come to San Antonio Rally.
I plan to attend the rally, but I won&#39;t if Steve thinks it will be a problem.</description>

We had a whole posse of youth at the bibby&#39;s last night: Aaron Ryan, Meg Cusack, Ryan McCarthy, Jack Burens, all driven by Colleen Crotty. Then Mikey Arthrell, Joel Brazzel, and oops I think someone else that I don&#39;t remember, all arrived at like 10 or 11pm.</description>

Yesterday I ended up awake all night until 6:50am.
During touch groups, David and I ethernet connected our computers and I got some MP3s of Amy Leyenberger harp music. Excellent.
After that, the dance was great fun and extended an hour by popular demand. Several people commented positively about my dancing technique. :-) Tanner and I helped teach Andrea some moves she can use to dance.</description>

Maggie called me not so long ago asking if I knew the non-emergency number to the police. She had been in an accident, but was okay. I told her it was quite alright to call 911 even if no one was hurt.
I&#39;m thankful that she&#39;s fine, and that she called, because I had put my snooze on for far too long and would likely have been late to meet with Kim Sawyer.</description>

Tired, tired.
Really impressed with what Fred has done for the new journal look. He wrote some bad ass regular expression parsing thing. He found some code to determine what day of the week was a certain day, and I simply ripped the code from its modules and made a little program to run it.
Fred incorporated it into his code.
Today Fred took a small box of my stuff (water fountain, dictionary, sew perfect toy, CD jambox, candle holders (brass), tea kettle, crystal bowl, 3 plates, picture frame) to The Guild Shop, and then I took the collapsable desk, and red/blue chest of drawers there.</description>

I feel really scared and tired and anxious and everything. I found myself in ASL really wanting to just sleep. Now I have just spent 30 minutes working on an email to Steve about my religious beliefs. I feel this is a worthwhile project for me overall, but I&#39;m hard pressed to think of a reason to really do it right now except that it distracts me from my other emotions, and lets me play on the computer where I&#39;m comfortable.</description>

Last night I attended Amy&#39;s sister&#39;s wedding at Amy&#39;s house. It was way casual; the bride was barefoot; he was in flip-flops. I was barefoot as well.
This is apparently their second marriage together. They honored their daughter Raine during the ceremony. She&#39;s about 6 or so years old it seems.
After the ceremony and buffet style dinner, karaoke was the entertainment of the evening.</description>

I just called Wende to see when she will finally get home; it seems like she&#39;s been gone forever!
She answered the phone, which was a huge surprise, and said she is in Houston at Taco Bell with Bob.
Bob? my brain thought about being jealous. &#34;Who&#39;s Bob?&#34;
&#34;Jennifer&#39;s husband?&#34; Wende&#39;s voice made a question mark at the end wondering why I didn&#39;t know who she was talking about.</description>

Well, we just used my computer to burn a nine inch nails CD for Fred. The first one we played was written in mp3 format. Very short. The second one was in CD format, but the songs are out of order. We&#39;re too tired now to fuck with it further to see how to control the order of songs. I&#39;m surprised at how late it is.</description>

      <description>1:23 am Saturday 15 June 2002
I&#39;ve been playing around on my new Mac a lot during my free time yesterday and today. (Today&#39;s free time came after I worked 11 hours at Dennis&#39;s work, organizing their competitive literature.)
Strictly speaking, I&#39;m still not internet connected; I couldn&#39;t get Dude&#39;s linksys router to allow the firmware upgrade to make it 802.11b instead of just 802.3.. OS X won&#39;t do 802.3, but OS 9 will.</description>

I chatted with my neighbor Andrea tonight. She had just made popcorn so we munched on that, just chillin&#39; on her couch. Her roommate Alana was there for the first little bit, but she left around 10:45 or so.
Andrea and I traded travel plans; she&#39;s going to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, somewhere else early next year. I updated her on my Japanese trip plans (interview with Nova on 20 June)</description>

I did sleep after riding my bike to 1/2 Price Books to purchase Miracle of Mindfulness, which they didn&#39;t have, but they did have a Power Puff Girls little diary looking thing, including a pen holder, so I bought that to be my yoga journal.
Got home, transcribed my yoga journal notes to my new PPG journal and then took a nap.
Oh!! I got to see our old house!</description>

I just spent a bit over an hour (two?) composing an email about myself for this girl/woman Ashley, who saw my entry on match.com. I&#39;m careful to remain clear that I&#39;m not looking for relationship.
Um, oh - today after work I visited Jennifer at Paint This! and finished the soap dish. This one looks ten times better than the first one, which I painted in a rush with a big paint brush.</description>

They never found a CD player, but talked a bit more as I applied pressure to knotted muscles on Corey&#39;s back and Erin&#39;s hand.
Maggie and Olivia said that we were cool; I informed them of the rest of the cool youth in the district and encouraged them to get involved with SWD events or the other districts nearby Memphis.
Olivia is asleep; Maggie is reading The Great Gatsby; about 70% of the way through.</description>

I&#39;m not going to bed yet, but this is the last entry I&#39;ll likely write before my trip to Memphis tomorrow.
Funny: Sean (actually his dad Rick) asked if anyone would be at the airport around 12:10pm. I replied that I&#39;d be there by 12:18pm, but didn&#39;t know if Sean would want to hang around that long.
I&#39;m at work now, hanging out a bit while our friends at Singapore are awake, but they didn&#39;t email me back so oh well.</description>

Last night I was up until 5am this morning after talking to Kristen and Catherine at Biba&#39;s. We were at Biba&#39;s until 4:30am.
So fun hanging out with them; they are hilarious!
This morning I let myself sleep in until about 9:30am and then I got ready quickly and zoomed on my bike to work. I got from my complex to work in less than 60 seconds.</description>

Have just arrived back home after going to see Parade, starring Katharine and Catherine, friends of Kristen.
I feel quite tired and don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll get it all down.
The movie (*) is not about a parade, although there&#39;s a reference to a parade in the show. It&#39;s the story of Leo Frank, who was accused of raping a 13 year old girl in his factory.</description>

Last night after being inspired at work to get some work done, I rode home, talked to Spot, ate a snack, then rode to Dude&#39;s house to catch up after my trip.
He wasn&#39;t home, so I slept on the back patio until he arrived about 40 minutes later.
Pizza delivered, optimized-for-web my 501 pictures from the London Paris tour, slide show on Dude&#39;s big screen TV for Dude and Gene.</description>

I went to a rave last night, where a girl smiled big at me while we were dancing and then subsequently approached me, put her arms on my shoulders and said, &#34;I want to cuddle&#34; and then something, and I was all, &#34;I&#39;ll dance with you, but that&#39;s it.&#34; She asked if I was drunk (not like, Oh my gosh you don&#39;t want to cuddle; you must be drunk) and then asked if I knew anyone that could help her get something.</description>

Came to work after leaving Dude&#39;s around 11:45pm. I just felt energized and ready to do some coding in the absence of people. I used a din of Front 242, protein of some fake veggie meat from Whole Foods, and sugar/caffeine of Dr Pepper to keep me going.
I didn&#39;t get quite done with this mini project - I&#39;ve re-vamped the code that creates a new G3 project in 5 minutes.</description>

Cool. Amy has the same dancing-technique as me. Dance alone, who cares what we look like, dance to sweat. Awesome.
Dude is choosing not to sign the contract for the phone.
Gene&#39;s rechargable battery pack quit working.
Dude is going to make a fake Promote-Houston website:
 Houston has the most fast food, fewest outdoor exercise opportunities, most pollution, most HazMat calls, etc. We have subsidies for professional sports team owners (if you own a team, and need a stadium, we&#39;ll build one for you!</description>

      <description>11:59pm Friday 21 September 2001 My dad came over today and we went to Whole Foods to get food and then stopped by KFC for dinner. Ate dinner and Wende brought me a fountain with spinning ball that is so great. I set it up, finished eating, then got to work with crying.
Couldn&#39;t cry full blown on the couch, so we went upstairs and into Wende&#39;s closet where I cried into pillows and mostly cried when I started thinking about 3rd grade meanness from Corey Fisher, and that Kristen my dog died and Jedi died.</description>

Such a great time with family talking during and after dinner. Mostly talked about Aussie Rules Football to kick off the conversation and then just all the little cultural differences, mostly about speech: pronounciation and idioms.
I was tired, but quite thoroughly engaged by the conversation and could have stayed up much later.
Now Wende and I are sleepin&#39; on a full sized waterbed back at Nick and Irene&#39;s house.</description>

Wende and I have just arrived home from Maggie and John&#39;s house. We watched The Fifth Element after Holy Grail and I fell completely in love with Milla Jovovich again. (I fell in love with her the first time when I saw her as Joan of Ark.) I love her eyes and mouth and nose, in that order.
Wende said I could marry Milla Jovovich if Wende can marry Bruce Willis.</description>

Tonight I visited Jennifer and Lance&#39;s house (on the opposite side of us from Jennifer and Bob.) The grout between the slats of their wood floors is coming up, similar to ours. We will hire a 3rd party floor person to come examine and see what he thinks is happening, and then we&#39;ll talk to our builder. The houses are still under warranty.

 After Ultimate, I walked Kat and Nikki(sp) back to the dorms. They invited me in for Gatorade down in the basement. We got down there and some people were already watching the movie Daylight starring Sylvester Stallone. So we watched and Sly was climbing through a huge exhaust fan, blowing up mud to stop a leak, using a radiator tube to save a guy from drowning, risking his life to save the dog, and then he and the girl got separated from the rest of the group.</description>

D called while I was in the shower and she needed help with the digital logic. I was just jacking-off in the shower anyway, so I hopped out to help her. We did the homework and then started talking about sex. We flirted back &amp;amp; forth about her coming over and fucking my brains out. We ended up engaging in phone sex and she described what she would do with me.</description>

I talked to them for about an hour and then a dude named Tom did something really dumb that pissed off Sarah. So I sat with her for 30 minutes while she described what a crappy thing he had done.</description>

I got my Citibank bill from VISA, and they also credited my account for $698.50 for the Nishika Camera shit. Dude. so I called them to try and determine if I can keep it no sweat. The lady gave me the impression that Visa is now waiting for Nishika to send them the money. Hmmm. I&#39;m just going to hang onto it and not spend anything for a while.</description>

I have to be in class in 7.25 hours.
&#34;Today,&#34; Molly, Maggie, Jeanine, and I went to House of Pies and it was totally not busy. Our waitress, Tina was cool. She brought me a big glass of water and learned our names and changed the radio to a cooler station. We left her a big tip. Brandon, the RA from second floor Taub, and AJ, and another dude came in and sat in the adjacent booth.</description>

9:40PM.
I had fish and potatoes and milk and angelfood cake, whipped cream, strawberries. Amanda called along with her friend Margaret?. We talked for a little bit. I told Amanda to write me a letter and to get me a picture of Rachel, Amanda, and Margaret. I want to go to Astroworld! The Cyclone has been &#34;fixed up.&#34; I don&#39;t know what they could do.</description>
