<p>They never found a CD player, but talked a bit more as I applied
pressure to knotted muscles on Corey's back and Erin's hand.</p>

<p>Maggie and Olivia said that we were cool; I informed them of the
rest of the cool youth in the district and encouraged them to get
involved with SWD events or the other districts nearby Memphis.</p>

<p>Olivia is asleep; Maggie is reading <em>The Great Gatsby</em>;
about 70% of the way through.  They are out in the hall.  Everyone
else who played SF is in the high school room zonked out, including
Erin underneath the back table.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p class=date>8:32 am Sunday</p>

<p>"Bring Out Your Dead!"  [BONG!] "Bring Out Your Dead!"</p>

<p>It would be a funny way to wake up people at the next rally: Get AJ
and Noah to drag sleeping bags of people into a pile.</p>

<p>I'm not going to bed yet, but this is the last entry I'll likely
write before my trip to Memphis tomorrow.</p>

<p>Funny:  Sean (actually his dad Rick) asked if anyone would be at
the airport around 12:10pm.  I replied that I'd be there by 12:18pm,
but didn't know if Sean would want to hang around that long.</p>

<p>I'm at work now, hanging out a bit while our friends at Singapore
are awake, but they didn't email me back so oh well.  While waiting, I
updated a few old journal entries.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to go eat a snack or something with Lee-eh.</p>

<p class=date>12:54 am</p>

<p>Lee-eh just asked, "can I keep [this]?" pointing to the menu as the
waitress was leaving our table at House of Pies.  She was all, "yes,"
then as she walked away, "until you leave."</p>

<p>Funny.</p>

<p>Last night I was up until 5am this morning after talking to Kristen
and Catherine at Biba's.  We were at Biba's until 4:30am.</p>

<p>So fun hanging out with them; they are hilarious!</p>

<p>This morning I let myself sleep in until about 9:30am and then I
got ready quickly and zoomed on my bike to work.  I got from my
complex to work in less than 60 seconds.  (That does not count walking
my bike <em>through</em> the complex.)</p>

<p>Erika came in for a <em>brief(!)</em> visit.  I was a bit let down;
I thought she was staying for lunch with us, but no.  She will,
however, be in Houston during the summer, and therefore may be here
more often.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm in nin din mode about to work on the project I was working on
Friday - converting excel file to html.</p>

<p class=date>4:43pm</p>

<p>Okay, I've finished the first phase of the excel->html process,
validating the integrity of values in the excel file.  Now I write
code to actually produce valid HTML output.</p>

<p>Well, first I flowchart steps to produce valid HTML output.  Then
I'll leave for my men's group.  Then go see Wende and help her with
some investment club stuff.  Then go to bed.</p>

<p>Have just arrived back home after going to see <em>Parade</em>, starring
Katharine and Catherine, friends of Kristen.</p>

<p>I feel quite tired and don't know if I'll get it all down.</p>

<p>The movie (*) is not about a parade, although there's a reference to a
parade in the show.  It's the story of Leo Frank, who was accused of raping
a 13 year old girl in his factory.  He seemed to be pardoned by the governer
of Georgia, but then a mob killed him, according to the book.</p>

<p>What impresed me most was the freezes that the entire cast had to do on
occassion.  Just to stand so still for so long is too much for me.</p>

<p>Fuck I'm falling asleep as I write.</p>

<p>The show as much heavier plot and subject than I expected.</p>

<p>I was impressed with how many actors and actresses I recognized from
previous shows.</p>

<p>After the show Kristen, Jessica and I met Catherine at Biba's and were
soon joined by Katharine.  Lots of laughter and funniness, but Katharine
left a big early with sore gut region.  We laughed for so long about so
much, until we were gasping for air between funny sound effect making when
someone pointed to someone else.</p>

<p>had to be there.  So funny!</p>

<p class=date>1:46 am</p>

<p>Long tall texan. (**)

<p>(*) Due to being so tired, I wrote movie instead of play or musical.
<br>(**) Due to being so tired, I quoted a Lyle Lovett song I think.</p>

<p>Last night I got a call from Char, a woman I met
throgh church many years ago - like when I was 10. 
she has bee a sort of spiritual
mentor/cheerleader/guide over these years. 
conersations with her seem to always fill me to
overflowing with goodness.</p>

<p>I had called her a couple days ago after my <a
href='https://www.thewealthsource.com'>personal
coach</a> encourage me to get in contact with someone
who could act as a spiritual mentor for me.   Char is
the first person who came to mind.</p>

<p>Char was 100% supportive of my intended travel to
Japan; she agreed that I need to go
<em>experience</em> these other cultures, far away
places, just as Bryn and I did recently.   Some people
are content to just read about places to, but I have
to <em>go</em>.</p>

<p>Such a great blessing and uplifting connection with
Char!</p>

<p>Got to sleep around 11pm.</p>

<p>Last night after being inspired at work to get some work done, I
rode home, talked to Spot, ate a snack, then rode to Dude's house to
catch up after my trip.</p>

<p>He wasn't home, so I slept on the back patio until he arrived about
40 minutes later.</p>

<p>Pizza delivered, optimized-for-web my 501 pictures from the London
Paris tour, slide show on Dude's big screen TV for Dude and Gene.</p>

<p><img src='/images/peeps/Gene/no_begging.jpg' align=left> Gene and I rolled over
to my house where I gave him his magnet that I imagine he can use
while preparing delicious meals.</p>

<p>We stayed up chatting for about an hour, mostly about future plans
and such.</p>

<p>He left, and I got to sleep around 1am ish.</p>

<p>I went to a rave last night, where a girl smiled big at me while we
were dancing and then subsequently approached me, put her arms on my
shoulders and said, "I want to cuddle" and then something, and I was
all, "I'll dance with you, but that's it."  She asked if I was drunk
(not like, Oh my gosh you don't want to cuddle; you must be drunk) and
then asked if I knew anyone that could help her get something.  (As I
type this, "ABC" by The Jackson Five is being fed through the speakers
at this internet cafe.  Same one I was at yesterday, but this time I
purchased a 24 hour pass for £4.  Now it's "(I can't get no)
satisfaction" by whoever sings that.)  I was all, "um, no, but good
luck."  Then she's all, "are you from around here?"  I told her no and
it turns out she's from Chicago.  She backed off and then when she left
she gave me a cheek to cheek kiss and "nice to meet you."  "You too." 
mwah!</p>

<p>Came to work after leaving Dude's around 11:45pm.  I just felt
energized and ready to do some coding in the absence of people.  I
used a din of Front 242, protein of some fake veggie meat from Whole
Foods, and sugar/caffeine of Dr Pepper to keep me going.</p>

<p>I didn't get quite done with this mini project - I've re-vamped the
code that creates a new G3 project in 5 minutes.  It's more flexible
and more programmer friendly.  But right now it doesn't work.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>Cool.  Amy has the same dancing-technique as me. 
Dance alone, who cares what we look like, dance to
sweat.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Dude is choosing not to sign the contract for the
phone.</p>

<p>Gene's rechargable battery pack quit working.</p>

<p>Dude is going to make a fake Promote-Houston
website:</p>

<ul>
<li>Houston has the most fast food, fewest outdoor
exercise opportunities, most pollution, most HazMat
calls, etc.</li>

<li>We have subsidies for professional sports team
owners (if you own a team, and need a stadium, we'll
build one for you!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Good night.</p>

<h2 id="11-59pm-friday-21-september-2001">11:59pm Friday 21 September 2001</h2>

<p>My dad came over today and we went to Whole Foods
to get food and then stopped by KFC for dinner.  Ate
dinner and Wende brought me a fountain with spinning
ball that is so great.  I set it up, finished eating,
then got to work with crying.</p>

<p>Couldn't cry full blown on the couch, so we went
upstairs and into Wende's closet where I cried into
pillows and mostly cried when I started thinking about
3rd grade meanness from Corey Fisher, and that Kristen
my dog died and Jedi died.  Surprising thing is that I
have blamed myself for Jedi's death.  Cried cried
cried  about that.</p>

<p>But the best part about that is that I hadn't
really recognized this shame / guilt I was feeling, so
that means since I've uncovered it, I can uncover
more; more shame/guilt might be hiding, and I am
thankful to find it and release it.</p>

<p>Higher Self said that at this point I should choose
myself over both Wende and Sally.</p>

<p>Talked to Katharine and hopefully will be able to
help her with her stuff.</p>
