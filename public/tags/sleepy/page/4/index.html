<p>Wooooo</p>

<p>Awesome.   Put my bike together tonight and rode around with
janette.  Saw Jon M (who is living with Olivia and Jen for his last
few days in Japan) on the way out of Bell Wistaria.  My bike felt
weird at first, but by the end of the evening, while janette was stuck
in a median waiting for highway traffic to go by, I zoomed up over and
down the highway on the pedestrian ramp thing.</p>

<p>Supazoomed down the hill into Tarumachi.   It ruled.  I'm *really*
happy to have my bike here in Japan.</p>

<p>Good Nova-bashing tonight at the ol' 101. Dan just finished his OJT
today;  Matty and I traded punches at Nova's material.  Matty had a
bit more to say than I do; I think he knows the book more. Nah, not
really, but he was really funny about the fuckin' Everyday
Conversation lessons.</p>

<pre>
"Are you a foreigner?"

"What's that?"

"ARE YOU A FOREIGNER?"

"I'm not deaf; you don't have to yell."

"I'm sorry."
</pre>

<p>"Polish that turd for 45 minutes," concludes Matty.  "No thank you;
I'm not fuckin' doin' it."</p>

<p>I pick up janette in 13 hours!</p>

<p>Tried quite diligently to hack into Steve's website, but wasn't
able to.  Trying to figure out how to set up a BBST on my
site. Tantalizingly close to directories I need to see, but nope.</p>

<p>Tonight was Carla's birthday party.  Lyle bet me 300 yen I couldn't
do 60 pushups in 5 minutes.  Eric did 47.  I did 44. Benny did 60 in
less than 5 minutes.  Lyle did 60 in less time than it took Benny.</p>

<p>I enjoyed sitting next to Adriana for a bit and hearing about her
upcoming adventures in OZ and Italy translating.  I'm really excited
for her.  I wonder if I'll ever learn Japanese.</p>

<p>Gotta go to bed.</p>

<p>Oh, Yoshie canceled our Wednesday rollercoaster day.</p>

<p>Ah geez!  Stupid morning!</p>

<p>In the process of going to bed, I saw that Frank was watching _Red
Dragon_.  <em>Ah.  Red Dragon.</em>  So I watched it with him.</p>

<p><b>Now</b> as I'm going to bed, it's fully light outside!</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Frank says that he should have just killed himself and be done with
it.  "That's a much more interesting ending - choosing to end his
serial killer career for love."</p>

<p>"But I liked Ralph Fienne's tattoo.  That was money."</p>

<p>I'm going to bed now soon as I finish this entry and copy it to my
site.  Will meet Satoko at noon at Cinecitta for lunch.</p>

<p>ps: Frank watched the eyeball chewing scene twice.</p>

<p>Good job studying.</p>

<p>I had a revelation of sorts.</p>

<p>just get the vocab in my head and don't worry as much about grammar.</p>

<p>I'm tired enough to fall asleep right now, but I'll probably call
janette for a bedtime story.</p>

when I wrote them down) and the ones I know or kinda know now, and the ones I'm learning:</p>

<p>Three things:</p>

<p>(zero) Agreed with Jon L to give a level four student level up to
level three.  She was quite happy and passed the test rather well.
The level 3 test is rather difficult, according to Steve.</p>

<p>(ichi) Had a great 7C student to close out the day.  Her name is
Kazue, and she's a computer engineer of some variety.  Part of the
reason I liked her is she remindes me of someone else, but I can't
remember who.  She was quite yammerful, not like a normal 7C, all meek
and waiting for prompts before speaking.</p>

<p>(ni) Talked with Karen, my dad's wife about 20 minutes.  I talked
to her longer than I've talked to her ever before.  I'm not sure what
that means, but it's probably a combination of missing home and not
having experienced her anger anytime recently.</p>

<p>(san) Talked a long time with janette.  All was cool until I came
out with not really wanting to know her past because some of the parts
I know sorta creep me out like she has smoked and I'm like eeee gross
and her reaction, understandably, was "hey man that's all part of me"
and she was careful to not get defensive, but it did make her a little
sad.  Sigh.</p>

<p>(shi) At the very end as we were hanging up, she goes, "I hope that
your experience there will help you know what types of things you want
to have close to you in your life," and I was just CONKED in the
emotional head with it like BAM *sadness*.  But I didn't want to
extend the conversation longer; it's 1am and I've got to be at work in
8.5 hours.</p>

<p>(5) I did 1 - 4 above instead of studying Japanese.  I trust it's
all for the best, but sometimes it's hard to see what's best.   and
sometimes I realize there is no best; there just is what is.</p>

<br>i did not mean to conk you on the head.<br>
 i don't know how we got from you telling me #10 stories to where we ended up. <br>
 i got off the phone and cried and cried.<br>
 i feel -------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
 but i am going to figure this out, damnit, until i am feeling balanced again.<br>
and i wish we were together to talk it thru or at least so you could hold me  while i cry. <br>
i can't think of anyone else with whom i want to investigate these conflicting emotions.<br>

<p>Good progress on Silent Football pages.  Consistent navigation on
top, and have permission to post some rule variants as written by
another group.  Also emailed about 4 other people for input on my SF
research project.</p>

<p>Today I noticed that it's the people who do things differently that
get noticed.   Those who are willing to go against the grain.
Apparently I want to be noticed, which is why I keep wondering about
this. So I don't want to go against the grain like Eminem and diss
everybody and everything.  I'd like to go against the grain more like
Ghandi, but I don't know anything about him really except he somehow
got a bunch of cats to not fight against those who wanted to fight
them. Or something.</p>

<p>Frank is in the other room writing what I presume is his book.  I
just took a shower and wondered about my technique of being so
scattered, which is something I seem to admire in janette, who can
just flitter about from project to project, somehow keeping all the
lids on all the pots and all the people around her happy, and herself
too, it seems.  And I admire that in her but I wonder if it bugs me in
myself.  It's like I want to focus on one project and make it complete
and really do something, but there's a part of me that doesn't finish
- that can't do that final step of folding the clothes after I've
washed them, dried them, collected them, but then just blam throw them
in the drawer unfolded.   or cleaning my room which is not all that
messy, but just stays perpetually in this state of not quite clean,
even though various parts of it cycle through phases of cleanliness
(except for my desk, unless it's on a really slow cycle which happens
to be in the messy phase).</p>

<p>Ron Anderson believes that credits are the key to happiness.  He's
a miser to the nth degree and tries desperately to hoarde his wealth
cause he thinks they will keep him happy.  Or that one day when he has
enough he will become happy.</p>

<p>Mr Biggs has a ton of wealth.   His accumlated wealth makes
Anderson's look trivial.  Biggs knows that wealth does not equal
happiness.  He gains happiness by tormenting others, by making them
suffer.  He has such a ridiculous amount of money that he cannot be
touched by anyone or anything.  He owns all of this.</p>

<p>The girl, whose name I've forgotten, is one of the heros of the
story.  She knows that though computers and wealth are flashy and fun,
that the true essence of life is in life itself - in experiencing life
consciously, with an amused detachment as she lets her angels guide
her where she needs to be.  She's one that I'd marry, except that I'd
be too afraid to talk to her.</p>

<p>Her brother, whose name might be Alex, is on the same path as their
dad Ron, but he will discover almost too late that money will rip his
soul from his self, and we'll try to rescue him from all the horrors
that are trying to push him down.</p>

<p>Ah.  I suddenly remembered the names of the siblings.   Andra and
Anthony.</p>

<p>Anthony has created an AI droid from scratch because he didn't
trust anyone to create it for him.  He wanted to know absolutely there
were no programming virii or bombs of any variety in her.  He loves
her and has fallen in love with her, and would basically freak if she
were taken away.</p>

<p>This is interesting.  I named her Nova, after the fucking fine girl
in an old TV series(?) miniseries(?) about outer space and the like.
She was absolutely gorgeous and I fell in love with her on that TV
show.  I just looked up her name on my site and... ew.  Nova.</p>

<p>Okay.  I've got to go to bed.</p>

thank you for complimenting my multi-tasking ability.  &ldquo;keeping all the lids on the all pots&rdquo;- did you coin that phrase? clever.<br>
  i love to get mentioned in your column.  i am famous, now.<br>
 wootwoot <br>

a good way to learn about ghandi is to read Freedom at Midnight.  a big thick book about the british colonization and eventual expulsion from india.<br>
  do you have time to read big thick books?</p>
