<p>今、優彦さん　(まさひこ) のいえにいます。</p>

<p>I really like his wife's spoken Japanese; I don't know if she
  speaks more clearly or if I am suddenly understanding more, but it
  seems that I can pick up more of her spoken words than other
  peoples'.</p>

<p>Ummmmm we took the train to his house (over an hour from 綱島) and
  he cooked a rockin' dinner!  janette *totally* would love this; the
  house is full of quirky stuff and not at all like a stuffy clean
  house that I thought most (but what the heck do I know, this is the
  first Japanese home I've been to) Japanese homes might be.  Anyway,
  I totally want janette to come visit Masahiko's house and have him
  cook for her and me; that will rule.</p>

<p>Watched two western movies each starring James Dean, whose voice is
  nothing like I thought it would be (I expected Elvis, and I found it
  squeaky and Texan twangy), East of Eden and Giants (?) I think.</p>

<p>Anyway, mostly my mind has been on what</p>

<p>(( oh, tonight was my first bath in a Japanese home; wash wash
  wash in the shower and then galooosh (gently) into the HOT water
  and soak until my heart was like, "hey jack, this is too hot" and I
  got out.  Nice, but chotto hot for me ))</p>

<p>the hell I'm doing in Japan and what the hell I'm doing in the
  world.  In my mind I have begun to compose a theory that I can never
  settle down with one *anything* be it home, country, relationship,
  job, project, anything.  I'm having tons of fun experiencing new
  experiences tonight with MH and have (jeez we're camping out on
  futons in the guest room while his wife is in the main room (I
  presume) and I'm trying to turn off the light and explain that I can
  type just fine without it and he's like turning it back on insisting
  that it's okay; I hope he falls asleep soon; we're scheduled to be
  awake and ohgodthirty (4:30)) really enjoyed this and part of me has
  wondered if I could settle in this area and ride the とかいど line
  for an hour to work every day, and part of me realizes I could
  settle anywhere, but I don't want to settle anywhere cause I want to
  see everywhere first.</p>

<p>じゅんこ, his daughter called and asked to talked to me and I
  yammered with her a *bit* in Japanese like, "what is your name" (おな
  まえは何ですか。) and something else easy, oh spelling her name in
  Japanese and then she said "あってください。" and it took me a bit
  to understand what she meant, basically a polite "I look forward to
  meeting you," and I'm like, "oh 私も" and it all begins
  again.  <em>Junko, junko, how old is Junko?  Could I stand to have
  Masahiko as my inlaw? I wonder if she's cute?</em> etc and it's like
  holy shit dude, cut it the fuck out, but it's still there; it still
  happens.</p>

<p>でも, I wonder what what what I'll do in the world.  I've
  considered writing to "famous" people who have guided me to ask for
  more guidance, but I know that the guidance really must come from
  within (thank you Kristen (do you still read this?) for banging me
  on the head with that one (will you ever kiss me? (oh shit I should
  probably erase that)) a couple years back) and fuck if I'm not
  quite sure how to get at it (meditation, dingaling)</p>

<p>So my idea is basically that I can never settle, never be
  satisfied, until I find that settled place within myself (yes I know
  it's a process (Jennifer (same b-date 5 years later))) and not black
  and white (Bryn), but there's still got to be some mysterious red
  pill that I'm missing that will show me the truth.  Right?</p>

<p><em>boo-boooo.</em></p>

<p>Yes, the truth is that I don't actually want *anyone*; I want parts
  of everyone; I want my mommy to take care of me; I want to know (be
  told) what to do all the time; I want to do everything myself (in
  the ER, covered in bandages and white astral light, "no problem,
  Dad, I got it under control.") and I want to be <em>the best</em> at
  everything I do.  ("You're not cool; you'll never win, if you're not
  Arian; Aries, Aries, we're the best; we're better than all the rest"
  or something like that [and] "... cause Aries are the best." "Of
  course!")</p>

<p>I want to look back upon my life and be <em>amazed</em> at what
  I've done.  I just want to be like, "wow.  Good job."</p>

<p>Okay; maybe that's all for now.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>nothing else came to mind while I read comics.  Supposed to be
  awake in 2.75 hours.  good night.</p>

<p>Studied a tiny bit.  I've got to wean myself off GTA3 and
internet.  I've done well with getting off the internet recently.
Well, weller than before.  Matty is going to sell the TV and
playstation soon.</p>

<p>50,000 yen for big TV and PS2 and games and VCR and Sopranos VHS
tapes (purchased, not recorded from TV).  Huge deal.</p>

<p>Tonight was a crazy filled night with Frank, Peter, Matty, Chris,
Gbenga (pronounced "benga"), Atsuko (pronounced "liz"), Megumi,
Daiske, Sorie and her husband at Korean Barbecue.</p>

<p>My head is a bit tired from all the inanity.  (not insanity)</p>

<p>Daiske sculled 2 beers, each in like 5 seconds flat.  Chris (a
Kiwi) encouraged it.</p>

<p>Peter has turned a new corner and hasn't had alcohol in almost a
month.</p>

<p>I tried to practice Japanese with the nihonjin.  They mostly
answered in English.</p>

<p>Daiske was really drunk and leaning over me for 15 minutes to give
a painfully slow and repetitive, otherwise 2 minute speech to Frank
about how Frank touched Daiske and such.  Quite endearing, but wow.
Quite long.</p>

<p>Liz finally got Daiske to say "until next time" and we parted
ways.</p>

<p>The westerners are at the river drinking and yammering.  I gave
Frank the tape recorder and 1/3 left of a 150 minute tape.  It is too
cold for me to hang with them.  Fucking freezing in my mind, but not
really freezing.  Like 55 degrees I bet.  Frank loves it; I don't.</p>

<p>Rode the train home with Morag after work.  Chatted with her, got
an overview of her life history.  From Scotland but raised in Canada.
Went back to Scotland for three months to waitress, then home for five
weeks and now out here.</p>

<p>Hung out with Miki in Musashi-Kosugi after that.  With a little bit
of thought, we were able to come up with 40 kanji that I know!  That
includes yama, kawa, 1-10, Sun-Sat, up, down, stop, gate, eye, big,
white, Tsunashima, Kawasaki, tree, wood, forest, person, left, right.
Oh, one more that we didn't think of while there: inside.
Awesome.</p>

<p>Came home, did two loads of laundry, shaved my head.   Bedtime.</p>

<p>janette saw that I took a photograph of a cute blonde while we were
in Kyoto and now we are breaking up.</p>

<p>What a dumb photograph.  Can't even fucking see the girl in it
except that she's blonde.  What a dumb idea to take her photo.
Fuck.</p>

<p>We talked about it, and it seems that I don't want to have a
girlfriend because I want to do everything alone.  I love having
breakfast lovingly made for me, but I want to learn how to do it
myself.  I want to rely on <em>no one</em> but myself.  Is this
lunacy?  Must we always rely on others?  What about people living off
the land?  Must *I* always rely on others?</p>

<p>I want the world to take care of me.  The world to make me
breakfast.  I want to have done amazing things in the world.  I want
the world to be amazed.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I have offered janette my continued friendship, and a place to stay
while she is in Japan.</p>

<p>Went to a river.  Saw no monkeys.  Ate vanilla and green tea softo
cream.  Did see three guys in truncated kayaks.  Saw some babies tears
moss.  Surprise/spider lillies.  Saw a giant tent that turned out to
be white sheeting hiding a well tower.   Ate om rice at a little
out-of-the-crowd cafe.</p>

<p>I know a day has been full or lazy or distracting or both if the
first entry is a sleep entry.</p>

<p>Rode bikes with janette.  My pedal <em>fell off</em>.  May need to
replace it sooner than planned.  7500 yen for a new crankset.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Went to Miho's with janette.  Mmmmmmmm.</p>

<p>Went shopping with janette.  She yammered with ..   wait that was
yesterday I think.</p>

<p>Read _Stranger In A Strange Land_ to janette.  Chapter xxxii.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Tomorrow (and by tomorrow I mean we have to leave in 5.5 hours)
we're going to Hiroshima (for one night) and then Kyoto (for three
nights).  I haven't packed.  Yay.   But I have made some preparations,
like purchasing all the tickets we'll need for airplanes, shinkansens,
hotels.  Have collected a few snailing addresses of peeps in Japan.
Not so many of peeps in US.  But email me your snailing address within
5 hours and I can send you a postcard.</p>
