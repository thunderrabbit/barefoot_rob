<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>I missed OKC Rally.  OKC is my favorite rally besides Houston.
And Houston is my favorite only because Jason and I planned it for
some years in a row and made it kick major ass.</p>

<p>OKC is my favorite rally because of fantastic memories of OKC 1987
and the church is a coooool shape for Sardines and awesome Silent
Football memories and because I learned the secret to Ceiling Wall
Floor at OKC.</p>

<p>I hope you cats had major fun.</p>

<p>You're still in my dreams at night.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>I'm not going to attend SWUUSI.  I'm not even going to try, though
last year I said I would ask for the time off.  I don't want to go
through the pain of saying Goodbye again....  This seems to be what
Bryn described to me at San Antonio Rally a couple years ago.  I
wonder if it's subconsciously a reason I'm not getting too close to
people here in Japan.</p>

<p>Shit I gotta go to bed.  I have Japanese class in 9.5 hours.</p>

<p>Studied for some hours and then got sidetracked with Nine Inch
Nails music in my head, specifically the end of "Perfect Drug."</p>

<p>During my sidetrackedness, I've just created a nin compilation for
Jackie, who expressed interest in nin music some weeks ago on LJ.  I
love nin so I want to encourage her appreciation of the music.</p>

<p>My intentions for tomorrow:</p>

<p>!) That I go to the police box and they'll have my wallet
<br>@) If no wallet, I'll go to the bank and get cash
<br>#) Regardless of walletification, I'll buy a new chain-wallet
<br>$) Meet Koko at international lounge and embark with her:
<br>%) if no old wallet, to get a new gaijin card
<br>^) bicycle recovery mission, no matter how many wallets I've got.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>Crud.  I didn't realize how late it is.</p>

<p>I've been reading/writing email, listening to iTunes (working on a playlist
for a CD I'll burn for work) and I did laundry.  Didn't study Japanese
tonight.</p>

<p>I'm kinda stuck in that mode of
oh-god-I-have-too-much-to-do-so-where-do-I-start and instead of
starting just get sidetracked.  Ah well.</p>

<p>But I gotta go to bed so I can get up and embark on a new adventure
at Nova with the correct shoes which of course I'll need cause my bike
is awol.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that as soon as I get out of here
(internet cafe) I'm going to remember that which I feel like I'm

<p>Okay.  I hope that was it.</p>

<p>Tiiiiired.</p>

<p>Janelle looks a lot like woman from Something about Mary.   DAmn
that's how tired I am; I can't think of her name.</p>

<p>We got phones after work.  I have a phone now.  I don't have the
number memorized, and it's way across the room so I'm not going to get
it now.</p>

<p>The phone has a camera on it and so many features that I couldn't
even figure out how to save names on it, nor even how to make a phone
call!  Now I know why Frank was all, "I just want one fuckin' feature
on my phone: <b>ring</b>."</p>

<p>Frank helped me save names on it.</p>

<p>Got home, Matty, Frank and I went to Miho's restaurant.  Miho is
the name of a waitress who speaks pretty good English, has a great
smile, and is quite friendly.  I don't know the actual name of the
restaurant, but they just call it Miho's cause of her.  We got a pile
of food for 1600 yen each.  Frank could tell all the different types;
I'm too tried to fuck with it now.</p>

<p>I'm to work for the next year in Kawasaki, about a 30 minute train
ride from where we live.  It's apparently a red light district, so
maybe I can soon confirm the existence of vending machines with used
girls' panties for sale.  I wonder how a red light district might
affect my addiction.</p>

<p>We stopped by DVD/CD rental place and they're watching a DVD now.
I fell flat fucking asleep on my bed in my clothes until Frank
hollered at me to see if I want to watch the movie with them.</p>

<p>Cameron Diaz!</p>

<p>So Austin Rally is kicking it and I'm still awake.</p>

<p>But I'm not at the rally; I was at work until now.  Bluh.  Well at
least that will help me bling bling it some.  I should make like $150
from today.</p>

<p>Clocked in at 10:47 AM and out at 3:36 AM or so.</p>

<p>Laura Douglas, her friend Paul, Meredith Kime (Matt's sister) are
on Janette's bed watching a movie.  Joel Rowboat is watching a concert
movie on the computer.  Jack and Heather are on Sean's bed sleeping.</p>

<p>Josephine is at the rally.</p>

<p>I'm supposed to be back at work at 10am.  Fuck.</p>

<p>It's for a big fucking Bosier City church stage decoration (railing
thing and podiums, all of which are heavy as fuck)</p>

<p>I'm falling asleep as I write.</p>

<p>My foot is fine; I didn't cover it today.  In fact when we set up
the stage at Fair Park out in the mud, my socks and shoes got all
muddy, and when I couldn't stand the soaked feeling on my wrinkly
feet, I took my shoes and socks off.  My foot did just fine.  And my
other foot did just as well.</p>

<p class=date>5:20am CST Saturday 1 March 2003</p>

<p>Too tired.</p>

<p>Fun to work with mongu.  He's funny.  We carried parallels off the
truck to under a big white tent for Johnny to build a stage.  Also
carried down 3/4 inch plywood and masonite.  a pile of masonite fell
onto me as I was trying to shift it out of the way and pinned my legs
in the truck.  Took a struggle to get out.  hurt.  Scraped off some
skin from my shins through my jeans.</p>

<p>Went to lunch with Justin and Mongu.  Justin is writing a movie
called Pod Zombies: 15 scenes of people doing pot, turning into
zombies and eating one another.  "When they get the munchies, it's
your ass."</p>

<p>Been emailing/phoning with Fred; he's helping me some with my
website.  I'm trying to set up a cool way to basically prepend my
navigation buttons at the top of my pages.  I'm trying a technique of
using a script that takes as a parameter the requested
dir/ectory/file.html that a person wants, writes the navigation
buttons, then writes the results of a GET request of my own site of
that directory and filename.</p>

<p>But for some reason it's not really working.  I can return the
result of a GET request from google.com, but not robnugen.com.  Dunno
why.</p>

<p>Going to watch a movie now.</p>

<p>I just read my journal entries to Janette, during which time I
found that I scratched my glasses.  That musta happened when they
quite dirty after I played Don't Drown and then wiped them clean with
my T-shirt.</p>

<p>D'oh.</p>

<p>I'm going to read <em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em> using my
laptop screen as a multi-thousand dollar night light until we fall
asleep.</p>

<p>I just read today's journal entries to Janette as we're listening
to fun accents on the back porch as people chat.</p>
