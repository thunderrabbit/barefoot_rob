only thing Orlando has over the other is a shorter title.</p>

                        <p class=date>11:38pm CDT Monday 4 August 2002</p>

<p>Just got to Bibby's after going out to Stan's Blue Note with Marta,
Jenae, Cris (short for Cristy), and Cris's brother Mike.  Mike is loud
rude and funny.  At least rude with his friends.  They are incessantly
calling one another motherfucker and ass and stuff like this over the
phone: "fuck you fuckin' motherfucker I'm not buyin' I bought last
three times.  Okay, call me."  That's just how they play, it
seems.</p>

<p>Mike got Marta and Jenae each twice with "hey what's on your
shirt?" or some variant thereof.  He was all "I'm gonna get you three
times tonight, watch."  I left before their night was over; but he had
gotten both of them twice.  "One more to go, and I win."</p>

<p>"Win what?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; I just win."</p>

<p>"He wins the story," I interjected. "'Hey remember that night I got
you three times?' That's what he wins."</p>

<p>He told me he'd get me, and I bet him five bucks he would not.  I
stood next to him intentionally to give him ample opportunity, but he
never tried.</p>

<p>We played about four games of pool.  One time the game was lost due
to scratching on the 8 ball, and I pushed new quarters into the
machine and then sank the remaining two balls (in exactly two shots; I
was doing great compared to my regular ability) and realized, "oh
fuck" when whoever was racking the balls was like, "we're missing two
balls..?"  Aw man.  Three more quarters in to recover two balls.</p>

<p>I went up to the bar, requested and received three replacement
quarters "cause the machine jacked us," which of course, was a lie of
sorts, but the bar will get the quarters back anyway, plus Mike says
he is here almost every night for the past 3 years, and dropped $2800
at the bar last month.</p>

<p>(And he asked me why I don't drink.)</p>

<p>Twice we played doubles: me an Marta versus Cris an Jenae.  Twice
Cris and Mike played.  At the very end of Mike and Cris' second game,
Cris was intent on sinking the 8 ball, then she would win.  It was a
weird angle so Mike was all, "I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't make
it," even though a big sign directly above the table explicitly says
"NO GAMBLING for money or beer.  Violators will be kicked out." or
something like that.</p>

<p>Cris only had ten bucks, so Mike said, "fine your ten against my
twenty.  And if you miss, I'll let you try again."  She missed.  She
missed on the second try as well.  On the third try, he was all "if
you miss you have to clean my apartment for two weeks."  She missed.
Then he was all, "okay, double or nothing." but Cris refused to budge
from her seat until Mike set up a pretty direct easy shot down the
table.  She went for that and made it.  Zero weeks of cleaning the
apartment.</p>

<p>We got bored of pool and went back to our valeted (past tense of
valet) vehicles.  I chose not to join them on their next adventures;
didn't want to get to Bibby's too inconsiderately late.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>I'm pretty hungry and tired right now.  I've just woken up after
sleeping since midnight or so.</p>

<p>We had a whole posse of youth at the bibby's last night: Aaron
Ryan, Meg Cusack, Ryan McCarthy, Jack Burens, all driven by Colleen
Crotty.  Then Mikey Arthrell, Joel Brazzel, and oops I think someone
else that I don't remember, all arrived at like 10 or 11pm.</p>

<p>Everyone-ish took a gander at all the <a
href="/images/journal/2002/07/swuusi">pics</a> I have from SWUUSI.  A bit
over 900, though many are taken in quick succession, so a lot will be
culled out.</p>

<p>Janette made tons of food; we chowed and it was all great.  I've
had a lovely time here.</p>

<p>I'm feeling a bit headachey - my sinuses have been reacting to what
seems to be much lower humidity here than Houston or Lake Murray.  I
took a generic Tavist last night.</p>

<p>Going back to bed now.</p>

<p>Cried a lot at closing circle.  Bhyllx came to stand next to me.
So did Bryn.  So did Wende.</p>

<p>Noah, Meg came over after closing circle.  So great to get such
support from them.</p>

<p>Yesterday I ended up awake all night until 6:50am.</p>

<p>During touch groups, David and I ethernet connected our computers
and I got some MP3s of Amy Leyenberger harp music.  Excellent.</p>

<p>After that, the dance was great fun and extended an hour by popular demand.
Several people commented positively about my dancing technique.  :-)
Tanner and I helped teach Andrea some moves she can use to dance.
Like the extended Grocery Cart dance and the Reading A Book dance.
Good stuff.</p>

<p>Around midnight was worship, where we were asked to describe how we
wanted to be remembered.  I fell asleep for much of the worship, but
woke up just in time to light a candle in the middle and say I want
all of YRUU to know this is a tremendously difficult process for me,
choosing not to attend some rallies for a while during my visit to
Japan.  I intend to be available via email and I'll write back to
whoever writes me, but it may take a while.  <a
href="mailto:rob@robnugen.com">rob@robnugen.com</a>.</p>

<p>After sharing, we had a hug circle with lots of hugs and love.
Wonderful.</p>

<p>After worship I hung out with Erin, helping her figure out some
solutions to issues she was having.  Susie helped with that when I ran
low on ideas.</p>

<p>Watched a surprisingly variable star that was visible a tad east of
Pleiedes (sp) I think.  May have just been the atmosphere, but the
star was bright like a planet and flashing red, white, blue in the
sky.  It remained in the same location for hours and according to
Kevin, had been there multiple nights in a row.  Sounds like a planet
in brightness and stability, but I've never known a planet to randomly
flash between red, blue, white like that.  Oh and change in relatively
luminoscity (sp) as well.  Second by second it was changing color and
brightness.</p>

<p>It was 4am as I entered the mess hall and Elizabeth + Lisa were the
roving advisors.  I took over for Lisa, so she could sleep.  I chilled
in the mess hall with Jackie and Joey who were working for hours on
the mugbook.  I brought them cereal and then Elizabeth and I roved the
camp once to find many sleeping youth.</p>

<p>We found a sleeping Rob soon thereafter.</p>

<p>Maggie called me not so long ago asking if I knew the non-emergency
number to the police.  She had been in an accident, but was okay.  I
told her it was quite alright to call 911 even if no one was hurt.</p>

<p>I'm thankful that she's fine, and that she called, because I had
put my snooze on for far too long and would likely have been late to
meet with Kim Sawyer.</p>

<p>However, soon as I started getting ready, Kim called, saying that
his house was on the verge of being flooded, and asked to
reschedule.</p>

<p>No problem.  zzzzzzz</p>

<p>Tired, tired.</p>

<p>Really impressed with what Fred has done for the new journal look.
He wrote some bad ass regular expression parsing thing.  He found some
code to determine what day of the week was a certain day, and I simply
ripped the code from its modules and made a little program to run
it.</p>

<p>Fred incorporated it into his code.</p>

<p>Today Fred took a small box of my stuff (water fountain,
dictionary, sew perfect toy, CD jambox, candle holders (brass), tea
kettle, crystal bowl, 3 plates, picture frame) to The Guild Shop, and
then I took the collapsable desk, and red/blue chest of drawers
there.</p>

<p>Ate lunch with Kristen at Hobbit Cafe.  Attended I-group, where
they gave me big blessings and love.  Chris from I-group took me and
Robin out to dinner.  Picked up Fred and hung out at Dude's.  Now home
and going to bed.</p>

<p>Up a bit late, helping Swa'vet a bit with her copy of the script,
mostly listening to their discussions, somewhat talking to Logan, son
of Stephan (who encouraged me to get a camera), since Logan was bored
senseless.  They had been here since 5pm.</p>
