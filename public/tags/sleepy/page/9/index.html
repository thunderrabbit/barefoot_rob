<p>I feel really scared and tired and anxious and everything.  I found
myself in ASL really wanting to just sleep.  Now I have just spent 30
minutes working on an email to Steve about my religious beliefs.  I
feel this is a worthwhile project for me overall, but I'm hard pressed
to think of a reason to really do it right <em>now</em> except that it
distracts me from my other emotions, and lets me play on the computer
where I'm comfortable.</p>

<p>I'm going to go to sleep now and not call any of my friends to
distract me futher.  Just me and my emotions as uncomfortable as they
may be.</p>

<p>Thank you, emotions, for the blessings you bring me.</p>

<p>Last night I attended Amy's sister's wedding at Amy's house.  It
was way casual; the bride was barefoot; he was in flip-flops.  I was
barefoot as well.</p>

<p>This is apparently their second marriage together.  They honored
their daughter Raine during the ceremony.  She's about 6 or so years
old it seems.</p>

<p>After the ceremony and buffet style dinner, karaoke was the
entertainment of the evening.  Amy really like karaoke; she has
probably 50 different CDs of music, though they focus on oldies and
country with a little bit of pop from about the 80s and 90s.  Nothing
less than five years old.</p>

<p>Marta called me from Hard Rock Cafe, where she had just been
treated to dinner with her church group.  I invited her over and we
sang Elvira ( by Oak Ridge Boys??).  I know the song pretty well since
my dad had it back in the day; we listened to it a lot.  I gave it my
best country twang and Marta did the low Giddy Up a Doo Wop part.  Big
cheers; it was deemed to be the best performance that night.</p>

<p>Later, after I butchered Arethra Franklin's RESPECT (and Marta
carried it pretty well) we just let a CD play and sang as we were able
the different songs.  Sounded bad enough that we cleared the room.
After some 10 songs ish, we joined the group.  Amy was all, "what
about our backgroud entertainment?"  At least it was appreciated by
someone.  :-)</p>

<p>Great fun party; good job Amy et. al. for successful hosting.  Oh,
and great job to Amy on the awesome slideshow!</p>

<p>Last night I drew out a calendar to plan my transition from here to
who-knows-where, and sketched out some possible travel plans.  I'd
like to put them on my site, but I won't do it unless I have an HTML
editor somewhere between emacs and M$ word.</p>

<p>(Hmm.  It appears that emacs has more extensive html editing skillz
than I understood at first. I'll see how well it can do what I
want.)</p>

<p>At 11:30pm-ish, I got a call from Catherine, who asked me to come
to Spy around 12:45am to interview for a job as a doorman.  She met me
outside, told the valet to park my car for free, introduced me to
Morgan, a guy who was checking IDs outside the club.</p>

<p>"You're Rob?" he asked.  "What's your phone number, Rob?"</p>

<p>I gave it to him and as he wrote it down, he said, "You've been
given very high recommendations by Catherine.  Okay, I'll call you in
about a week or two."  Interview complete.</p>

<p>I explained that I am available for work until the 19th.  He
understood, no problem.  He sent me inside the club and I hung out
with Catherine a bit.  She has worked at the front desk taking money
at the door for years.</p>

<p>We watched the 104 KRBE sponsored bikini contest, "this is so
degrading," we both agreed.  The three girls who won were all white,
blonde, fake boobs.  Yo J (who I know from college days) was MCing the
event, and will apparently is there every Friday night.</p>

<p>Catherine and I went upstairs, she got free bottled waters, and I
noticed a banner on the wall advertising the bikini contest had
misspelled receive something like, "the winner will recieve..." tsk
tsk.</p>

<p>(man, look at me all snooty about correct spelling)</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Catherine had to go to a meeting, so I hung around watching some
peeps dance and then left after not too long.  My clothes all smelled
like smoke, which they probably will each time I go inside for too
long (the doorman job is outside, fortunately).  Um, oh, if I get this
job, I will need to boost my clothing repertoire as well.  I'll
probably request some fashion tips from one of my girl friends.</p>

<p>Went to Kinko's and IMed for a bit with Colleen, Sean, Amanda, Bryn
(all from YRUU) but ended up awake too late - got home and showered and
in bed at 4:58am.</p>

<p>I just called Wende to see when she will finally get home; it seems
like she's been gone forever!</p>

<p>She answered the phone, which was a huge surprise, and said she is
in Houston at Taco Bell with Bob.</p>

<p><em>Bob?</em> my brain thought about being jealous.  "Who's Bob?"</p>

<p>"Jennifer's husband?" Wende's voice made a question mark at the end
wondering why I didn't know who she was talking about.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob."</p>

<p>In the background, I heard Wende say to Bob, "get a <em>ton</em> of
hot sauce, don't forget a ton."  Wende is so cute.</p>

<p>"Call me when you have a chance; I have some news for you," I said.
She doesn't know that I plan to vacate the city soon.</p>

<p class=date>11:14pm</p>

<p>Wende never called me back; I'm going to bed now, but I'm going to
read <em>Mutant Message Down Under</em> by Marlo Morgan, a book that
Janette gave to me.</p>

<p class=date>11:48pm</p>

<p>Sleep now for real.</p>

<p>Just heard from Daniel; he razzed me a bit but was less concerned
than I was.  Ironic that Diana missed a date with me, and I missed a
date with Daniel, all in one day.</p>

<p class=date>11:25pm</p>

<p>Have just finished scoping out theWealthSource and <a

the structure of the Spirit Blue Eagle site.</p>

<p>Going home now.</p>

<p>Well, we just used my computer to burn a nine inch nails CD for
Fred.  The first one we played was written in mp3 format.  Very short.
The second one was in CD format, but the songs are out of order.
We're too tired now to fuck with it further to see how to control the
order of songs.  I'm surprised at how late it is.</p>

<p>Today has been a fantastic day.</p>

<p>I've been playing around on my new Mac a lot during my free time
yesterday and today.  (Today's free time came after I worked 11 hours at
Dennis's work, organizing their competitive literature.)</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, I'm still not internet connected; I couldn't get
Dude's linksys router to allow the firmware upgrade to make it 802.11b
instead of just 802.3..  OS X won't do 802.3, but OS 9 will.  Thanks to
Marcel for his research on this.</p>

<p>It did slurp up the pictures from my digital camera pretty easily, but
the image editor iPhoto is not completely easy for me to use.  I want to be
able to highlight multiple pics and delete them all at once, and I want to
be able to delete pics when I'm viewing them full size, and not just
thumbnail.</p>

<p>I spent quite some time exploring the linux side of things using emacs on
the terminal window.  I'll download an Aqua emacs as soon as I get OS X
online, and know what I'm doing.  I saw the real locations of several of the
folders, and I am curious as to how the Finder knows what folders to
display.  It doesn't display all of them, even though the permissions are
the same.  Curious.</p>

<p>I found a way to change the text under the buttons on Internet Explorer.
Now the buttons are:</p>

<p>back, jack
<br>mooove
<br>false
<br>refresh
<br>crib
<br>printify
<br>lazy
<br>e-mail</p>

<p>The lazy button is one that fills in forms for me. </p>

<p>Pretty fun stuff.  I'm going to bed.</p>

<p>I chatted with my neighbor Andrea tonight.  She had just made popcorn so
we munched on that, just chillin' on her couch.  Her roommate Alana was
there for the first little bit, but she left around 10:45 or so.</p>

<p>Andrea and I traded travel plans; she's going to Brazil, Argentina,
Chile, somewhere else early next year.  I updated her on my Japanese trip
plans (interview with Nova on 20 June)</p>

<p>We gossipped some about the apartment complex management, and how we
really liked that Suzanne remembered <em>all</em> of our names, whereas the
new managment does not.  Okay, yes, she was here for 10 or so years, and
they've been here a couple of months, but still, we miss Suzanne.</p>

<p>Conversation shifted to music when her CD player turned itself on at
11:30pm, as it apparently does every night.</p>

<p>I haven't really hung out with Andrea that much before.  One other time
sorta; fun stuff.  She's moving a few units down the way when Alana moves
out, so I'll have to walk an extra fifty feet to say HI soon.</p>

<p>I did sleep after riding my bike to 1/2 Price Books to purchase
<em>Miracle of Mindfulness</em>, which they didn't have, but they did
have a Power Puff Girls little diary looking thing, including a pen
holder, so I bought that to be my yoga journal.</p>

<p>Got home, transcribed my yoga journal notes to my new PPG journal
and then took a nap.</p>

<p>Oh!! I got to see our old house!  I rode by just to check it out,
and the new owner was there.  She welcomed me in (even though we had
never previously met) and I love what she's done.  Lots of colors and
cool funky furniture.  Quite amazingly different and yet still the same
house.  So great to see it so well loved.</p>

<p>On the way home I stopped by the old movie theater which is being
torn down.  A guy named Brent happened to be there taking pictures with
his digital camera, so I gave him my email address.  He may send them
to me, and if he does, I may put them on my site (with his permission,
of course)</p>

<p>Now I'm at Dude and Veronica's.  Got to hang out with them and Gene;
Veronica made great southwestern casserole so we munched that while
they shared stories of the MS 150 which was this past weekend.</p>

<p>I have just moved online the rest of my pics from <a

2</a> of me-an-Bryn's London adventure.</p>

<p>I just spent a bit over an hour (two?) composing an email about
myself for this girl/woman Ashley, who saw my entry on match.com.  I'm
careful to remain clear that I'm not looking for relationship.</p>

<p>Um, oh - today after work I visited Jennifer at Paint This! and
finished the soap dish.  This one looks ten times better than the
first one, which I painted in a rush with a big paint brush. I'm
thankful that it broke.  While there, I picked up my bike (spoke is
fixed; yay!) from University Schwinn.  Super thanks to Jeff for not
charging me for the fix!</p>

<p>I called Dude's house and Veronica answered, so I invited her to
munch at Mission Burrito.  (Dude is out of town until tomorrow night.)
While at MB, Ryan Ray came up all, "Rob?" and I couldn't remember his
name, but I asked him to say his sister's name, and I remembered his
immediately.  See, I knew his name was in my brain, but it was a bit
buried.</p>

<p>We talked quite several minutes, and I met his friend Eddie (which
I remember because of the cartoon Ed, Edd, and Eddie), who is quite
interested in traveling.  His face lit up when I mentioned that I'm
moving to Japan next year.  I *totally* encouraged him to travel just
for the experience.  Go go go go. Just do it.</p>

<p>Drove home, then carried Spot to my work so he'd have a fun
excursion.  He was meowing some and walked around the office some,
then came back over to me like he was done.  So I carried him back
home and then rode my bike back over to work.</p>

<p>Moved online 1/2 of <a
