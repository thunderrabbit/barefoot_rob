<p>Sock Monkey dialed first with his right paw.  No answer.  He flew
around like supermonkey while the phone rang.  Then he dialed with his
tail, just for variety.  No answer.  (No variety.)</p>

<p>So Socks, Scott and I are going to go sleep down at that winding
road by the bay.  I'm thankful to have found it.</p>

<p class=date>2:58am</p>

<p>Okay.  Status: 1917 miles traveled so far.  I've been awake since
5:05am MST, so that's basically 23 hours.  In that time Scott and I
have driven (1917 - 1137 = ) 780 miles.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>

<p>Oh wait.  California, this is your big chance to really sell me on
living here by keeping me warm tonight.</p>

<p>In my room, there used to be boxes in the unused bathtub and no
window treatment in the bathroom.  The toilet and sink did work,
though; that was enough for me.</p>

<p>But now I find that the bathtub has been cleared out, a thoughtful
curtain put up, and even flowers in a small vase on the sink.
Beautiful.  I'm really thankful to live here.</p>

<p>Finally I've gotten to see where Steve lives.  And Hillary and
Bethany and Kathy.</p>

<p>Hillary showed us her beautiful glass pieces that she's blown.  She
has made three cups, two of them with colors, and two bowls, one of
them clear.</p>

<p>Her first cup cracked a big crack down the inside, so she affected
a cracked pattern on the whole thing and resealed it.  Amazing.</p>

<p>She described in pretty good detail how the process works.  I'm so
glad that she's found something awesome that she loves to do.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Bethany came home while Fred and I were laughing and chowing cold
pizza with Steve down in the kitchen.  H & B were soon bickering and
sorting things out, being just like sisters should.</p>

<p>Gotta go to bed.</p>

<p>Okay.  I found a perl script that writes to sendmail..  Basically
pipes to sendmail as a file.  Awesome.  Now the comments are emailed
to me.  I just gotta tweak their format.</p>

<p>Janette read a short story to Jack and me.  I fell asleep after
like 2 minutes, I imagine.  I'm quite tired after working today.  Lots
of manual labor carrying around heavy stuff and drilling holes and
bolting bolts and generally working harder than I've worked in quite a
while.  Excellent.  Good night.</p>

<p>I seem to have gotten stuck reading news.google.com and eating
vanilla ice cream.  Stupid brain sucking and brain enhancing internet
and yummy sugary ice cream.</p>

<p>I'm watching Comedy Central now.  Standup comedy.  Heehee.</p>

<p>Tamara just came home and offered to let me sleep on the bed in the
room behind her room.  Awesome.  Plus it has internet access so I can
read google news and livejournal.</p>

<p class=date>11:55pm</p>

<p>I just watched <em>Porn N Chicken</em>, Comedy Central's first
original movie.  Cute, and interesting that the main character's big
finale was to drive to California with no agenda.  Kinda like me?
Maybe, I guess.</p>

<p>I want to eat.  But actually I just feel sad and want to eat to
block that emotion.  I'm sad about not going to San Antonio Rally.
I'm going to miss you guys like crazy.</p>

<p>I'm sad that I can't tell you why I can't go.  I fucked up and
pissed some people off and now I'm not going.  I've been asked to also
not attend Houston Rally.  I really really really want to go to
Houston.  That's effectively my last rally ever.</p>

<p>I love you guys so much.  You're so smart and capable and
beautiful.  So funny and daring and awesome.  Thank you for the
opportunity to help you grow.</p>

<p>After watching <em>The Princess Bride</em>, Joana and Caycee wanted
to have a party.  Josh (?) Caycee's boyfriend was all, "you can't have
a party without some preplanning.."</p>

<p>Josh doesn't live nearby, so Joana and I went upstairs to someone
else's suite (Brent and Greg?) where some people were studying, and
some were zombified by the TV and/or pot.  Once the studiers quit
studying (not that they finished, but they were all, "well I'm not
going to get any more done tonight"), I kept offering games we could
play Silent Football, Mafia, Dead Fish, Truth or Dare, The Jackie
Purdy Game, Two Truths and A Lie, and none of those fully
materialized, but a few of us played 2 Truths and a Lie.</p>

<p>Then about five people came back from seeing "Red Dragon" and I
blurted, "were you amazed by how the bad guy..." and I tried to not
give away any of the movie, but I did and I felt dumb, but maybe no
one else cared.  I hope not.  Oh well.</p>

<p>We went to the room where people were mostly hanging out and then
they all went to a strip club on the rumor that a girl from their high
school was working there.  They left and Joana and I chatted with some
cat whose name I've forgotten.</p>

<p>Then we went downstairs and cut up magazines to make a collage, but
I was pretty much too tired so I went to sleep on the futon.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Next (this) morning I learned that Joana didn't get to her room
until late because Caycee and Josh were still there past 2:30am, when
she fell asleep on Meagan's bed.</p>

<p>I don't know when (or how she knew she could) go back to her room,
but that's where she was when I got up this morning.</p>

<p>Super tired.  I've been up reading a ton of livejournal entries,
and then reading my email via yahoo.  Message from Steve Feinstein
says he has heard rumors that some people are concerned about me not
having a church that I'm affiliated with and not having youth to bring
to the rally, but me still wanting to come to San Antonio Rally.</p>

<p>I plan to attend the rally, but I won't if Steve thinks it will be
a problem.</p>

<p>Good night.</p>
