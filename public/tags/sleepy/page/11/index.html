<p>Such a great time with family talking during and
after dinner.  Mostly talked about Aussie Rules
Football to kick off the conversation and then just
all the little cultural differences, mostly about
speech: pronounciation and idioms.</p>

<p>I was tired, but quite thoroughly engaged by the
conversation and could have stayed up much later.</p>

<p>Now Wende and I are sleepin' on a full sized
waterbed back at Nick and Irene's house.  This will be
our room during this trip.</p>

<p class=date>9:57pm CST Monday 1 January 2001</p></p>

<p>Wende and I have just arrived home from Maggie and John's house.

<p>We watched <em>The Fifth Element</em> after <em>Holy Grail</em> and
I fell completely in love with Milla Jovovich again.  (I fell in love
with her the first time when I saw her as Joan of Ark.)  I love her
eyes and mouth and nose, in that order.</p>

<p>Wende said I could marry Milla Jovovich if Wende can marry Bruce
Willis.  I told her it was a deal.  If any of you have contact
information for either of these two people, let me know.</p>

<p>After the movie, Will and I played billiards.  He was kicking my
butt and had sunk all but 2 balls.  I still had 6 balls on the table.
In an amazing feat of inadvertant pool sharkery, I sank 5 in a row.
Will and I missed our last shot (not counting the 8) a few times each,
and then I got mine, but scratched while shooting for the 8.</p>

<p>Before supper, we all played Clue, and I must say it was more fun
with the youth than with this group.  People in this group were too
scientific about it and got upset when they were surprised by cards
not being where they were apparently expected.</p>

<p>Ironically, I paid the least amount of attention to the game, and
wrestled with Scout (Molly and Will's dog) a lot, but still won the
game.</p>

<p>Dinner was fabulous as always at Maggie's.  We had sausage, carrots
and black eyed peas for good luck.</p>

<p>We played the Text-o-Grams game (same one as last night, and I just
made up this name that I might stick with for this game.  We'll see if
the name sticks.) - three sheets of paper worth.  I will put them in
my scrapbook.</p>

<p>emacs is working on the 20th ring from the main stack, and
subsequently working on moving the 16th ring from the second
stack.</p>

<p>Bedtime now.</p>

<p>Didn't work on Java, but read through messages on posted on BBST.

<p>Bed now.


<p class=date>7:02am Thursday 27 July 2000</p>

<p><p>At 4 am-ish I woke briefly from a dream about FSD (my work) doing a survey on itself.</p>

<p><p>Today is the day that I&rsquo;ve been asked to clean up the house- just like scrub the shower and the sinks and mirrors and sweep the floor kinda thing.  Wende&rsquo;s parents come into town tomorrow for their family reunion.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m not yet saying it&rsquo;s &ldquo;our&rdquo; family reunion, and that&rsquo;s okay.  I&rsquo;ve never been to this family&rsquo;s reunion before.  Maybe next year.  Maybe not.</p>

<p>Tonight I visited Jennifer and Lance's house (on the opposite side of us from Jennifer and Bob.)  The grout between the slats of their wood floors is coming up, similar to ours.  We will hire a 3rd party floor person to come examine and see what he thinks is happening, and then we'll talk to our builder.  The houses are still under warranty.

<p>I'm going to bed.

After Ultimate, I walked Kat and Nikki(sp) back to the dorms. They invited me in for Gatorade down in the basement.  We got down there and some people were already watching the movie <em>Daylight</em> starring Sylvester Stallone. So we watched and Sly was climbing through a huge exhaust fan, blowing up mud to stop a leak, using a radiator tube to save a guy from drowning, risking his life to save the dog, and then he and <em>the girl</em> got separated from the rest of the group.
<p>
The rest of the group was promptly saved by rescuers, and then Sly and she had to go back the way they had come, which was now way more treacherous since the water was way deeper. And then
<p>
Some dumb western movie began! They didn&rsquo;t show the end of the movie swear to God it was like the TV had changed channels!
Noooooooooooooooooooo!!!!   We cried.    Noooooooooooooo!!  WHERE&rsquo;S THE REST OF THE MOVIE????????
No use. It was gone.
<p>
The TV station showing the movie was the Student Video Network, local only to University of Houston, and I guess they just screwed up or assumed no one would be watching, or they are just very twisted and evil.
<p>
So I went home. On Allen Parkway, there were zillions of bicyclists and several skaters all with green glo-lites and stuff biking or skating their way toward downtown! I did a U-turn at Montrose.<br />
<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this all about?&rdquo; I asked.
<p>
&ldquo;The Moonlight Bicycle Ramble!  Happens each October&rdquo;
<p>
&ldquo;Awww man!!! I&rsquo;ve wanted to do this!!!&rdquo;
<p>
&ldquo;Come join us then!!&rdquo;
<p>
Greatly enthused, I zipped home and stepped inside around 3AM.
<br>
3AM&hellip; should I go?  I consulted my runes. If you pick a rune upright, that means &ldquo;YES.&rdquo;  If you pick a rune reversed, that means &ldquo;NO.&rdquo;
<p>
First I chose <em>Gebo</em>, then <em>Sowelu</em>. They each look the same upright and reversed. On the third selection, I chose <em>Uruz reversed</em>, so I didn&rsquo;t go.

<p>D called while I was in the shower and she needed help with the
digital logic.  I was just jacking-off in the shower anyway, so I
hopped out to help her.  We did the homework and then started talking
about sex.  We flirted back &amp; forth about her coming over and
fucking my brains out.  We ended up engaging in phone sex and she
described what she would do with me.  I came all over myself and it
was great.  I mentally cuddled with her and then we hung up.  Thank
you Thank you D.  Wonderful.</p>

<p class=date>3:30AM Wednesday 23 Sept 1992</p>

<p>Today after bowling, I played frisbee with Laura from bowling.</p>

<p>Today I walked around the dorms and ended up in Sarah &amp; Missy's room on first floor.  I talked to them for about an hour and then a dude named
Tom did something really dumb that pissed off Sarah.  So I sat with her for 30 minutes while she described what a crappy thing he had done.  She cried
and I held her until she fell asleep.  Sarah sleeps soundly.  After about 30 minutes of her sleeping, I tried to wake her up.  I did everything.
Talked to her, shook her, tickled her, pulled her eyelids open - everything.  During all of this, I was pretty horny (of course) so I kissed her on
the lips twice.  I didn't tongue her, but I thought about it.  Finally, I woke her up by standing her up and just hugging &amp; rocking (rotate
actually) her back and forth.  She finally finally wake up after a long time.  Wild.  At the very end, when she was awake and just barely coherent, I
asked, "should I bite you on the neck?" And I bit her on the neck and she giggled.  After she woke, she invited me to Two Pesos with all her friends,
but I declined so that I could do homework with Maggie.  So I did digital logic with her until 2am and I got home at 2:30 &amp; took a shower.</p>

<p>Bobbi is gone.  Bobbi is in Chicago.  Bobbi is in fucking <b>Chicago</b>.  I've had a pissy day today and I think that's why.  That and that Maggie
told me to "have a little respect" for Danielle's (Bartley) committment to her husband.  Fuck her who does she think she is?  I know what I'm doing
when I'm flirtiing.  Fuck them all.  I just want a new girl to kiss.  I just want a new girl to kiss.</p>

<p><b>I JUST WANT A NEW GIRL TO KISS.</b></p>

<p>At 11:30PM, I was at the VAX, pissed at my program.  I should have fucking gone home and been asleep for 3 hours now.  Instead, I fucking called
Carrie to see if she would walk around with me.  She did, and we went to the UC (locked) and then to the Agnes Arnold Auditorium.  Then we talked to
Judy for a couple hours.</p>

<p>"Today" was Homework Blockade.  i slept till 10AM and then went to the VAX until about 4PM and worked on the first LISP assignment.  Then I went to
Molly's room and slept for about an hour until Cindy called looking for Molly.  Molly wasn't there.  (She was at Ninfa's with everyone) Cindy said she
talked to Sarah, who said Bobbi went back to Chicago!  Holy Crap!  So- that sucks.  Cindy doesn't know if it's like permanent of what the heck.  She
said she'll try to find out.</p>

<p>Then Molly got back and we've done Probability &amp; Statitics since then.  She went with me to the laundry mat, and did homework there.  Now we're
here in my bed making out (NOT!) (heh heh) going to sleep 'til 7:30AM, at which point I shall write up my 3 prob &amp; stats turn-in problems.  Later</p>
