<h2 id="1-breathe">1) breathe.</h2>

<p>Focus on your breathing until the initial wave of anger has passed.  It may help to focus on counting the breaths.</p>

<p>Allow your breathing to deepen and slow.</p>

<h2 id="2-label">2) label.</h2>

<p>Say you yourself, &ldquo;I feel angry.&rdquo; Labeling the emotion brings your thoughtful brain back online.</p>

<p>This helps move beyond the Fight or Flight reaction of the reptilian brain</p>

<h2 id="3-acknowledge">3) acknowledge.</h2>

<p>Recognize the steps that brought you into this situation.  What part did you play in the buildup to this anger?</p>

<p>Taking responsibility for your part helps point to small changes that you can take to avoid anger next time.</p>

<h2 id="4-plan">4) plan.</h2>

<p>After acknowledging your part in the situation, notice where you can make different choices next time.</p>

<p>Visualize yourself making different choices to help increase the chance of remembering when necessary.</p>

<p><code>- - - - optional - - - -</code></p>

<h2 id="5-apologize">5) apologize.</h2>

<p>Depending on the situation, it may serve you to apologize.  Taking responsibility for your part in the situation can help restore your relationship with the other party.</p>

<p>Sticking with the basics, we have joy and fear.</p>

<h2 id="joy">Joy</h2>

<p>is how I feel
when I have what I want, or I don&rsquo;t want what I don&rsquo;t have.  I am
aligned with what <em>is</em>, and have no need or desire to change it.</p>

<h2 id="fear">Fear</h2>

<p>is the emotion which says I don&rsquo;t have enough information.  This is
usually about an unknown future.  I come to a proverbial fork in the
road and could simply choose arbitrarily, but if there is a part of me
that wants to choose the &ldquo;<em>right</em>&rdquo; option, I may feel fear about
choosing the &ldquo;<em>wrong</em>&rdquo; option.  This could paralyze me until I cannot
choose without more information about what each option entails.</p>

<p>Next, we have sadness.</p>

<h2 id="sadness">Sadness</h2>

<p>is how I feel when I recognize I have lost(*) something.  I had it,
and now I don&rsquo;t have it.  I feel sad.  The message here is simply to
acknowledge the experience of having, whether it was an object, a pet,
or a fellow human.  This is what funerals are for: to acknowledge that
the person who was with us is no longer here (in the physical sense).
We take the chance to experience the loss in its fullness, allowing
acknowledgement of the new situation so we can move on.</p>

<h2 id="anger">Anger</h2>

<p>Anger is a slightly different emotion.  There are a few different
emotions that we lump together under one label.  Generally speaking,
anger is an emotion that comes up when boundaries have been crossed.
So-called righteous anger could be when personal space or personal
property has been encroached or taken.</p>

<p>In general, if emotions are held in the body, they can cause problems, so it&rsquo;s best to express emotions as soon as possible so our emotional bodies run smoothly.</p>

<p>(*)
Loss is something of a false belief in that I never <em>had</em> it in the
first place, but this line of inquiry goes beyond the basics outlined here.</p>

<pre><code>Still fucking shaking with anger. I saw an old man grab a woman's
ass just as her train arrived. He tried to run so I grabbed him and
brought him back to her. She was like thank you and got on the train!

ass. so I yelled at him and let him go, never to see her again and
a bunch people wondering wtf crazy barefoot mf yelling

<p class="dream">Driving Mr Van with some friends, including Natalie
from PB, I learned that one of my friends was able to start Mr Van
with a lockpick key that worked very easily.  He wanted to drive, but
because he wasn't on our insurance, I said it was illegal and asked
him not to.</p>

<p class="dream">He distracted me with a puzzle and then when I looked
up, I disocvered he was driving the van! I was pissed!  I was like
"Stop the Van Right Now How The Fuck you think you can drive the Van
after I TOLD you very Clearly Not to!" and then was a bit more sane
and let him speak, but I assured him I had mentioned insurance and it
being illegal.</p>

<p class="dream">Other people in our group felt unsafe as a result of
my outburst, so I invited each person to clear with me whatever they
were feeling.  One of the women said she wanted to speak, but then
sent her daughter with a lawn sprinkler to spray water on people,
including me.</p>

<p class="dream">I went back into the van when the girl started
spraying some old man who was not even part of our group.  "Uh yeah so
I heard you wanted to say something, but I just got sprayed with
water; was there anything specific you wanted to say?"</p>

<p class="dream">No one else wanted to say anything, so I just ate
some grapes or whatever was at the table where they were eating buffet
style.  Then Kim Sawyer was there and I planned to tell him I had lost
it at a guy to get his input, but then Lin woke me up.</p>
