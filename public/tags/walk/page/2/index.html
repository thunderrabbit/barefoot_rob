<p>I heard some water trickling and noticed a fountain flowing into a
basin made of bricks.  There were a couple fish inside, effectively
making it a brick fishtank.</p>

<p>The sky was overcast so not too hot.</p>

<p>Oh, today was the day I walked across part of the dirt lot and up into
the back corner area.  I didn&rsquo;t think to take pics while on the
inside, but I might go again.</p>

<p>Lin joined me at first but then bailed. I did not walk far, but talked
to Delayna and Richard while walking.  Told them both about
<a href="https://thunderrabbit.krtra.com/t/1cPtBqCQn39c">Shift Your Shit</a>
program.  They both seemed interested, and Richard may be interested
in actually joining now.</p>

<p>This morning I walked during the typhoon that passed by Tokyo today.
I saw some interesting effects of water rushing down the hill near
よみうりランド前駅 I captured them on vertical video on Marco Polo to
send to Lin, who stayed home.</p>

<p>I nearly did not write this entry; I had a vision of writing an entry
after every walk, but I got sidetracked with an AB request that took 6
hours unfuckingpaid.  Now I know how Google Maps feels, now requesting
monies for their javascript API.</p>

<p>今朝超眠かったけど５時に起きて1時間ぐらい歩きました。</p>

<p>新しい場所を見たかったから初めての道を使いました。</p>

<p>おじいさん一人とちょっと挨拶しました(。|だ)けどちょっとドキドキでした。彼が優しい人だから、大丈夫だった。</p>

<p>Lin and I walked together yesterday on a completely new route.</p>

<p>I chose not to go to SOGO after flipping a coin after Lin asked if I
wanted to stay at home and install the vertical labyrinth game.</p>

<p>Lin and I got off to a later start than I had originally planned, but
we walked an hour around our neighborhood, finding some new streets we
had never used before and arriving via different routes in places we
had been before.  &ldquo;Oh!  we&rsquo;re <em>here</em>!&rdquo; kinda thing.</p>

<p>Wow!  3.9km in 58 minutes, according to Google maps.</p>

<p>I have been writing in Japanese about the walk.</p>

<p>Behind our house there are some houses under construction.  There are
no gates blocking entry so I went inside to have a look.</p>

<p class="note">(English translations from my Japanese:)</p>

<p>Outside the houses there was scaffolding wrapped in blue fabric.  On
the first floor the fabric kept anyone outside from seeing
me inside, but on the second floor, the fabric had gaps so I was
nervous at times.</p>

<p>The houses were close together, so on the second level of the house I
entered, I used the scaffolding to cross over to the next house, via
its scaffolding.</p>

<p class="note">back to English:</p>

<p>I walked straight Where I normally turn right to go back home, but
this time it went straight and found an interesting place I have
never seen before.  I think it is a recycling plant but I&rsquo;m not
sure. It has a nicely paved pathPeople can walk on along its length,
But the fences are pretty clear about where they want people not to
go.  I didn&rsquo;t go anywhere they didn&rsquo;t want me to, but through the
hedge I took a picture of one of their trucks.</p>

<p>For a moment across my mind that it might be neat to get a job there,
but I can imagine it would get old pretty quickly.  Maybe they offer
tours that we can just see inside facility.  That would be pretty
neat, and worth checking into, but I probably won&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p>After walking the length of their facility, I walked along the road
that had no cross streets so it seemed to be next to a river or some
other shallow valley.</p>

<p>The valley prevented me from turning right to go back toward the
house, soI ended up walking longer than I might have plans too, but it
was a pretty great walk.  On the way back I recognized that I had
walked along the street before, <em>and</em> I noticed it was next to the
recycling facility.  So I had walked next to the recycling facility
before, but I just didn&rsquo;t realize it.</p>

<p>TLDR Who cares.  3.1km walked.  the end.</p>

<p>Just before 5am, Lin let Jennie outside for her morning adventures.
Soon thereafter we could hear her catching up with another cat.  I
woke up for my walk and headed toward the altercation.  Unfortunately
my approach was a catalyst for amplification of the catastrophe.  They
catapulted away from each other and Jennie ran under a car before I
could catch her.</p>

<p>I continued walking and went 2.9 km according to Google.  My phone
didn&rsquo;t track me as precisely as I would have liked, though.  I hoped
to see some more waypoints than I got on the map.  Might have to find
an app to do it.</p>

<p>I woke up several times last night like 3am, 4am, and then ended up
waking up at 5:30am instead of 5am for my walk.  Got out of the house
bleary eyed by 5:45 am and headed toward かさはら&rsquo;s place.  He wasn&rsquo;t
outside (and I was 45 minutes later than the previous day) so I
strolled on past and walked up stairs to the right and met a man who I
ended up exercising with in a park (Takaishi Dai 3 Park, according to
Google Maps).  He said he is 73 years old and stays healthy so he can
play tennis.  It&rsquo;s people like him who are my models, old and
<ruby><rb>元気</rb><rt><ruby><rb>げんき</rb><rt>genki</rt></ruby></rt></ruby>
(energetic, chipper, healthy)</p>

<p>The tag 545-719 refers to when I left the house and when I got back
to write this entry.</p>

<p>2.8km traveled according to Google Maps.</p>
