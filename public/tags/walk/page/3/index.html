<p>I have decided to wake up at 5am each day, and on the five days I do not
have to immediately go to work (for which I have already been waking
up at 5am), I will go for a brisk walk around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Today I went up the hill and along the ridge and up left on a street I
had never walked before, then up a hill into a park and then omg down
a spooky mossy staircase with spiderweb strands hitting my face and
cicadas buzzing my ears and mosquitoes chomping my legs.   Upon arrival
at the bottom, I turned left onto a little street and met Mr Kasahara
who was like, &ldquo;can I show you?&rdquo; and I was like &ldquo;please!&rdquo; and he showed
me a rainbow colored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysochroa_fulgidissima"><ruby><rb>玉虫</rb><rt>たまむし</rt></ruby>
insect he called a <em>tamamushi</em></a>,
and went on at length about how it was such a rare find.  I was able
to understand about 50% of what he was saying.</p>

<p>The area where he lived used to be named Kasahara, but the Odawara
clan(?) came over and Mr Kasahara had to flee (for his life).  He is
85 years old, and apparently has a fair few stories to tell.  I hope
to see him tomorrow and bring my recorder to record some of his
stories for science and study etc.</p>

<p>I walked for 2 hours from NB lesson to Yoyogi Park.  I had 2 hours
total and Google said it would take 1 hour and 45 minutes.  I stopped
once to get a snack and a drink (and to change from pants to shorts)
and then stopped again to buy a 2 liter bottle of tea.  Made it to
Yoyogi Park with 2 minutes to spare.</p>

<p>I walked for 1.5 hours today, 25 minutes to the station, and then a
lot of walking to look for the TUMI shop and then walked to work&hellip;
almost walked to work; Lin called me back and offered to meet me at
our station to hand off a folder I forgot to bring with me today (not
critical, but for men&rsquo;s group meeting tonight, so I&rsquo;d prefer to have
it).</p>

<p>So I walked to Ebisu and took the Saiyo Line to Shinjuku,</p>

<h2 id="11-30">11:30</h2>

<p>whereupon I found the Odakyu Line was completely stopped due to a
suicide.</p>

<p>Thanks guy!  You saved me some time!</p>

<p>Headed back to work where I&rsquo;ve just arrived at 11:49.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired now.  Want to sleep super much but other people are here bah.</p>

<p>Right after I got on the bus to head back to 新杉田駅, I noted that I
could walk there in just 2km.  Or, better yet, I could walk to 鳥浜駅,
which is even closer to where I need to go.  So I got off the bus
after a couple stops and walked toward 鳥浜駅.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t get too far when I saw a park!</p>
