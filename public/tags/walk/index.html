<p>Lin and I walked around our neighborhood, which couulllddd possibly
count as a Walk that I started doing last year and dropped after
getting to 14 or so.</p>

<p>During this walk, I practiced a process I heard on an Esther Hicks
video recently.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my favorite rock.  You&rsquo;re my favorite leaf.
You&rsquo;re my favorite tree.&rdquo; etc</p>

<p>I found the transcription at the bottom of
<a href="https://grandledgeucc.org/mt-content/uploads/2019/06/sermon_06_09_2019.pdf">this PDF from a church newsletter(?)</a>
I look forward to finding the video where the transcription came from.</p>

<pre><code>1. Meditate for 15 minutes every day. Getting centered and
   clearing your mind can make a world of difference in our feelings.

2. Go outside no matter what the weather and move around in
   appreciation of this planet. Look up and around and find things
   to acknowledge, and talk about them right out loud: say things
   like: you are my favorite bird, you are my favorite flower in
   bloom, you are my favorite flower not in bloom, you are my
   favorite tree, you are my favorite frog, who kept me awake all
   night, you are my favorite rock. etc

3. Buy a notepad, call it your Book of Positive Aspects, and fill
   5 pages of positive aspects about a thing or subject or a person.

4. And the last thing. Every single day look upward and outward,
   best if you do it outside or standing near a window, and
   acknowledge that there are Universal Forces, God, focused right
   at us, and then say: 'I acknowledge that I am the object of
   your positive attention, and I'm appreciating your continual
   gaze on behalf of my well-being, and today, no matter where I
   am, no matter where I'm going, no matter who I'm doing it with,
   I will be in conscious awareness that you too are there with
   me, appreciating me, supporting me, assisting me, acknowledging
   me, inspiring me, guiding me, having fun with me, helping me,
   being aware of me, loving me, showing me, uplifting me...  get
   into an endless loop of that kind of acknowledgement, and watch
   what happens in your life.

<p>I walked with Mai and Richard as they walked with Fitz.  They let Fitz
off his leash so he could run around in a fenced area, but he just
trotted around instead of doing the
<a href="https://reddit.com/r/zoomies">/r/zoomies</a> that I expected.</p>

<p>He did a good job sliding down the slide, though he was not able to go
up the slide.</p>

<p>I should have taken pictures of them.</p>

<p>１３時３０分に西麻布の授業後、４時１５分に飯田橋駅行く予定でした。  <!-- my lesson finished in Nishi-Azabu at 1:30.  My next thing was in Iidabashi at 4:15 --></p>

<p>二時間４５分暇時間があったから歩く方がいいと思った。 <!-- I had 2.75 hours to walk 1.3 hours, so I decided to walk.  -->  マップを見たとほと
んど分かりましたからマップ見えずに代々木公園の反対側まで歩きました。 <!-- I checked the map and had a good idea of where to go, so I started walking without watching the map.  --></p>

<p>あっ。表参道で右曲がりよかった。  <!-- oops.  I should have turned left in Omotesando --></p>

<p>戻りながら、ミミズただ見ました。ミミズが乾いた道頑張れましたから、彼を
強く太陽の光ないの植物の下で持ってきました。 <!-- On my way back, I found a worm trying his best on the pavement.  I put him in the shade under a bush. --></p>

<p>彼が行きテラレったら、よかったです。  <!-- I hope he survives --></p>

<p>I chatted with Dora for 1.75 hours on the phone.  She had some amazing
insights on my presentation for MKP stuff.  Plus a course she has
enjoyed taking, designed to help people start their business projects.</p>

<p>While talking, I walked from Nishi-Azabu to the other end of Yoyogi
Park before realizing I had intended to turn right <em>before</em> Yoyogi
Park, or actually maybe even turn at Omotesando.  Anyway, it was all
good because I found an earthworm still alive on the sidewalk and
hopefully gave it another chance at living by placing it in the shade
under some leaves.</p>

<p>For some reason I believed I did not have any water to quench the
worm, but it turns out I <em>did</em> have water.  Weird.  It was pretty much
too late to go back and quench him by the time I realized it.</p>

<p>Neat to crisscross the city.  I walked across an intersection that I
had walked across perpendicularly many times.</p>

<p>Though it was short, I walked this morning around the new construction
near our house.  Took a picture of a stump or two growing on a wall.</p>

<p>I fell out of the habit since Walk 15, during which we bought eggs.</p>

<p>Yesterday a typhoon grazed Tokyo.  We got some wind, but hardly any
rain.  I left early for men&rsquo;s group to make sure I would be there even
if the trains stopped for the typhoon.</p>

<p>I had loads of time, so I walked from Yoyogi Uehara to Nishi Azabu, by
way of the Snoopy Museum!  The museum costs 2000 yen to enter, so I
skipped it until I have more time and can go with Lin.</p>
