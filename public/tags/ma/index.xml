Ma and I chatted while waiting for Nico to arrive and clear customs. Fun chatting with her and nearly finished solving the latest NYT crossword puzzle. I can see how it would be a good way to keep the ol&amp;rsquo; left brain sharp.
I chatted with the nice driver of the shuttle bus as she drove us to the IAH parking lot a couple miles away from the airport.</description>

Ma came to the baggage claim area to wait for me! We took the subway (subterrainian electric vehicle that ran on rails that looked relatively light) to the hotel and got some food there. I marveled at the size of the portions, but there was no in-flight meal so I finished what we ordered.
The veggie burger tasted somewhat like raw meat. Not sure if I would have enjoyed it if I thought it was real meat.</description>

      <description>13:12 Sunday 13 August 2017 JST Lin and Ma joined me on the way to SOGO. They watched from a bench across from the tree where SOGO peeps generally meet. Workout was great fun, though a bit hard since I haven&amp;rsquo;t attended in a while. Unfortunately I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to attend for two months starting in October. I&amp;rsquo;m bummed about that, but work is work.</description>

      <description>18:59 Thursday 28 January 2016 CST Fred grabbed his computer and dropped us off at Ma&amp;rsquo;s apartment. Jason was going to come pick us up, but due to lack of internizzle (and planning), I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to let him know what&amp;rsquo;s up before we got back so we&amp;rsquo;ll meet up with him after meeting Jackie and Paul instead of before.</description>

      <description>14:31 Tuesday 26 January 2016 PST Ma gave us some prezzies! Lin is giving Ma her prezzies now.
While Ma was out of the room, I used the same wrapping paper used for the present she gave to me to wrap the present I have for her. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if she notices!
I&amp;rsquo;ve double-wrapped it back in a box that I will pull from my bag as if it&amp;rsquo;s been packed since before we arrived.</description>

      <description>14:05 Tuesday 26 January 2016 PST Ma picked us up from Austin airport; we&amp;rsquo;re in her car now. (I changed &amp;ldquo;the car&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;her car&amp;rdquo; in case future historians come across this while trying to determine just when self driving cars become commodities. Note to future historians: soon, but not yet. Try again in 3 to 5 years, earliest.)
We&amp;rsquo;ve got the following things planned for this trip:
 Tuesday go to Ma&amp;rsquo;s apartment to drop off stuffs then walk to a restaurant Wednesday go to rental car place Wednesday go bowling tomorrow Sunday go see Dad; sleep over at his house Tuesday morning go to airport  ped gate 24 3</description>
