      <title>mt3: found little brother</title>

      <description>11:27 Tuesday 20 February 2018 JST I had previously thought of having the little brother come running up to see what all the fuss was about, and knock everyone off the stage. But I have done that once, and it wastes a bunch of time, and the timing didn&amp;rsquo;t work out anyway.
So in the end, the characters who were looking for him all turn around one by one. Candycane mom will put her hands on her hips after she fully turns around.</description>

Dug a hole for myself on the beach but it was too far from the waves to bury me in the sand. Headed down to the water a bit more and meditated with Lin. Kept moving down toward the water so I was in the waves from 0 to 40cm deep, avg 2~10cm. たのしかった

      <description>09:14 Wednesday 20 December 2017 -03 Here is Brazil, cashew fruit are available at any fruit stand.
I tried the fruit. So much water spilling out I think it should be called watermelon. Very stringy and not so delicious, but edible.
Once I finished the fruit, I looked at the stem looking thing.
Wait, so you&amp;rsquo;re telling me there&amp;rsquo;s a cashew nut in here? That&amp;rsquo;s awesome!
It was too hard to crack with my fingers, so I used my teeth to try to crack it open.</description>

      <description>##18:36 Tuesday 10 March 2015 JST##
The live md5 count thing has been languishing for a while, so I bribed peeps on bittippers to see if anyone would be interested. One guy added one string to the list, and then another guy and I added strings from 127 to 140 in a little less than two hours. Nice!
He said it was an interesting puzzle for him because he&amp;rsquo;s into cryptography.</description>

Family holidays ruined by earliest Easter in 90 years
 It was felt that to celebrate Christ&amp;rsquo;s resurrection on the wrong day would be blasphemous so it was very important to get the day right. The general rule was agreed at the Council of Nicea in 325 AD.
 hahahahahahaaaha!!!
This cracks me up. The idea that God / Jesus / anyone-who&amp;rsquo;s-enlightened would be displeased/upset/blasphemised if a celebration were held at the wrong time.</description>
