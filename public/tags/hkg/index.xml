      <description>13:10 Friday 06 October 2017 JST We have begun our descent into Hong Kong; should arrive in about 20 minutes. I have about 90 minutes, I think. The last two years I made my way through security in about 45 minutes, so I should have about 45 minutes (well 30 minutes) to chill around the gate.
14:33 Friday 06 October 2017 JST Made it through security pretty quickly; I had about an hour when I sat down at the gate.</description>
