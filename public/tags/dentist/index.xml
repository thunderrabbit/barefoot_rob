      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m headed to Nathan&amp;rsquo;s dentist which is now my dentist.
I like this dentist because he didn&amp;rsquo;t waste time checking my teeth three (3) appointments in a row without doing anything.
First appointment: &amp;ldquo;I recommend you fix this; wanna do it now?&amp;rdquo;
Yes!
16:49 He worked on two teeth, and best I can understand, he filled a filling on the left lower third from back tooth, which also suffers from gum disease (receding gum).</description>

      <description>21:28 Wednesday 13 February 2019 JST I finally made a dental appointment (with the dentist right under JB&amp;rsquo;s office) after over a year of not going. It&amp;rsquo;s for April 10th; there was no availability that lined up with mine. I will probably go to a dentist near our house sometime in Feb or March.</description>

      <description> 20:19 Monday 10 July 2017 JST I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good that I actually fell asleep three times while my dentist(&amp;rsquo;s dental assistant) cleaned my teeth. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t tired; it was just really relaxing.
10&amp;frasl;10 would go again and again.
