<p>This clip includes 1066 frames.  I didn&rsquo;t upload clips the past 2 or 3
times I worked on the track because it took a long time to add the
first three ribs to the edge of the largest marble&rsquo;s track.</p>

<p>Now I am in the process of getting some characters off the set because
they are just じゃま and wasting time during filming.  I already have
the brothers wasting enough time, plus the guy in the back trying to
make his way around the currently-highest point of the largest
marble&rsquo;s track.</p>

<p>I have been on my computer too long today already so might not upload
images.</p>

<p>Sorry future me, but current me is going to take a bit of a break.</p>

<p>I just streamed for 1.25 hours and uploaded a new video clip that
features 8 more seconds of video than in the previously uploaded clip.</p>

<p>I have worked on MT3 a few times since getting back.  A couple days
ago, progress was super slow and I did not even export a video clip,
much less upload one.  Today I got much further, after having figured
out a way to lift the bridge, and then I had the green cutter guy make
some curved toothpicks which will be used for rail supports to keep
the large marbles on track during the 2nd to last U-turn.</p>

<p>The little brother has kicked the chopstick ends back behind the stage
so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about not moving them anymore.  His big
brother is watching him.</p>

<p>After having raised the lower bridge, these three characters are about
to walk up simultaneously (up) toward the stage.</p>

<p>Here is the overview of the set now (after I disassembled the light
fragile triple tripod with upside down tripod).</p>

<p>I added a record 7 seconds of video in just 2 hours.  Part of that was
certainly due to fewer disparate things going on, not the least of
which being that the stage was stopped from turning!</p>

<li>the cutter is just about to cut the excess support off
the ramp base, after which the gluer will lift the base and glue the
pieces to it.</li>

which it will be rolled back onto the stage.</li>

<p>I am quite happy with at least half of the frames I shot today.
Fortunately, I am happy with the difficult ones!  They were the frames
in which the big marble rolled down the M Splitter and then slammed
against the wall, driving the white pole all the way into the wall.</p>

<p>After the ball hit the floor, I had the other characters react to the
&ldquo;sound&rdquo;, but upon playback, they react too quickly.  The frames of
those characters all moving toward the sound were all pretty easy to
take, so I feel good about re-shooting them.  <del>I estimate it&rsquo;s
about 15</del> I need to delete only 7 frames in all, so just the last
half second at the very end of the video below:</p>

<p>I worked on MT3 in two parts today.  Right around 2 hours total, I
think, not including letting glue dry (during which I ate lunch and
had a nice nap).  I found a pretty good technique for keeping the
large marble in place: using a twist tie looped around the track seems
to do the trick.  If I had taken the time to figure that out before I
had the guy push the big marble up the M Splitter, he would have been
able to walk up on both rails.  As it is, he had one foot down and one
foot up, lodged betwen the rail and the marble to keep it from
rolling.</p>

<p>Now, as of the last frame in the video below, the marble is being kept
in place with a twist tie.  I have marked some graduated lines on
Dragonframe to show how far the marble should move between frames.
Should be pretty easy to do the next frames, and if I can get the
timing right, I will have the marble push the white bar into the back
wall, just as a visual gag and exposition of just how massive the big
marble is.</p>

<p>I finally glued the last piece of the M Splitter.. and it works!
Marbles roll down it faster than I had hoped, so I considered lowering
it.. but there is <em>just</em> enough room for the small marbles to roll
<em>under</em> that track and onto the small marble track which has walls on
it, if I lower one of the walls.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that wall is also the support for the track, so it will
be tricky to cut.  I might have to use the dremel or something..</p>

<p>Oh, so while installing the supports for the M Splitter, the
red-and-white headed character knocked over the ramp.  Then the
character who helped install the ramp fell off the stage where the
ramp had been.</p>

<p>Only one hour so far today on Marble Track 3.</p>

<p>The images above show the track before and after having glued the
second support on the first half of what I am calling the M Dropper or
M Splitter.  It will split the medium sized marbles off the large
marble track by being too wide for the medium sized marbles to touch
both sides of the track.</p>

<p>35 more minutes during this break to let the glue dry, and then I will
hopefully get the second half of this track glued today and have the M
Dropper working yay!</p>

<h2 id="15-32">15:32</h2>

<p>Well I haven&rsquo;t yet glued the second half, but I did get to the point
where I need to clip the first half, so I just bought some clippers
(whereas I had hoped to buy a saw blade for my drill).</p>

<h2 id="17-31-saturday-25-november-2017-jst">17:31 Saturday 25 November 2017 JST</h2>

<p>The new clippers are pretty great!</p>

<p>Now three of four points are glued on the M dropper.</p>

<p>Today I glued the first half of the track which will separate the
medium sized marbles from the large marbles.  I am reasonably sure I
can get it to work without too much undo/redo, but it has taken some
time to get it to look like the characters put it all in place.</p>

<p>One slight mistake: I need to cut the end of the sticks because they
<em>stick</em> out beyond the edge of the circle.  I guess that is not bad in
itself, but for now I want to keep from doing that.</p>

<p>I will likely have to break, trim, and reglue the piece, but it should
not be too difficult once I put both of its supports down.</p>

vertical bar is cut, but I have not taken the photo for that cut.  The
green guy has swiped his sword, and I cut the bar, but.. let&rsquo;s just
say they are not poised for the shot.</p>

<p>I added about 2 seconds of footage today in 1.5 hours.  Fast because a
lot of it was just moving some characters around.  Slow because Jennie
came to sit in my lap for a bit.  (I have come to accept the idea of
letting her walk onto the scene; I will just take pictures of her
entry&hellip;  but she chose not to walk on the desk.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I am about to add a difficult bit to the large track, which
will kinda set the stage, so to speak, for one of the small tracks,
which runs nearby, and a medium sized track, which will branch off
from the large track (by falling through the track.  (That&rsquo;s the
tricky bit.))</p>
