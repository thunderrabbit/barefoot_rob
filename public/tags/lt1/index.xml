      <description>13:23 Thursday 22 March 2018 JST The court of support meetings are being held for seven weeks after the LT1 I attended in Portland on March 9th weekend. Each man will take the role of a different archetype, King, Warrior, Magician, Lover, as described in many places, including King, Warrior, Magician, Lover: Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine, and bite sized Four Archetypes of the Mature Masculine on Art of Manliness.</description>
