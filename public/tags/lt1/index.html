<p>The court of support meetings are being held for seven weeks after the
LT1 I attended in Portland on March 9th weekend.  Each man will take
the role of a different archetype, King, Warrior, Magician, Lover, as
described in many places, including
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91781.King_Warrior_Magician_Lover">King, Warrior, Magician, Lover: Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine</a>,
and bite sized
<a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/2011/07/31/king-warrior-magician-lover-introduction/">Four Archetypes of the Mature Masculine on Art of Manliness</a>.</p>

<p>I was in the role of Magician this morning. I will be the Man in the
Middle next week, presenting my situation and getting guidance from
the archetypes around me.</p>

<p>Bunch of great guys here in Oregon for the LT1 and ST1 dual training.
I attended ST1 (Staff Training 1) in Perth last year and am attending
LT1 (Leadership Training 1) in Oregon this weekend.  Got to meet Alan
who I know from my online men&rsquo;s circle, and met Mike P with dredlocks
who I had met online as well.  Also met Richard and was like &ldquo;woah!&rdquo;
when I recognized I knew him from online.  Have not yet seen Scotty K,
who I also know from online, but I told him on Thursday that I&rsquo;d be
here and he said he might come down.</p>

<p>Sad news is that I am an idiot and did <em>not</em> tell Collenie Beanie that
I would be here, and I did not realize until she was like, &ldquo;wait,
which Portland?&rdquo; on FB that I had effed up.  I was so focused on just
the weekend that I did not tell anyone except the men here.  Colleen
said she would have driven down to see me!  Oh god I am such an idiot.
I will be back by next year though, so I will be hella sure to let her
know ahead of time!</p>

<p>Got the blessing of the community tonight before dinner and John H
started to fundraise a bit for me to help start MKP Japan.  He wrote
me a check which covers my flight over here.  Not sure how to cash it
though unless they have my bank in this area.  Talked to John for a
while tonight, and he seems to have a wide range of detailed info
about a wide range of historical, financial, naval, and medical
topics.</p>
