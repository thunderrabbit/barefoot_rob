      <description>14:44 Sunday 01 April 2018 JST &amp;ldquo;Happy Easter!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not Easter!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;rdquo;?????&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;April Fools!&amp;rdquo;
Finally got back to SOGO today and it was touch! Camelia (sp) saw me and was like, &amp;ldquo;remember me??&amp;rdquo; and I was like, &amp;ldquo;I remember your face&amp;ldquo; (could be an insult, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t in this case), and she reminded me she had volunteered for Peace Boat since I last saw her. So neat to hear that it&amp;rsquo;s growing but still has the same genki energy as before.</description>

      <description>##10:57 Thursday 29 November 2012
In a camp area, getting to hang out with Carla after talking to some guys while up on stage prepping for an event, I told her how much I admired her ability to be genki with people and how I want to enjoying hanging out with peeps as much as she does.Â Something like how I need to just not worry about what other people think and just do whatever I want to do.</description>
