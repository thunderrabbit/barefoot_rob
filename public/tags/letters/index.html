<p class=date>3:10 P.M. April 5</p>

<p>Yesterday when I called Christina she was gone.  When I called
Charmain, she didn't want to do anything.  so I rode around at the
school.  Today I went to church.  Jessica, Cheri, and Emily were
there. We talked about AIDS.  Dad brought some rubbers there to show
us them and teach us about "safe sex."  As if we don't know.  Actually
Emily didn't know much. I was surprised.  Afterward, Cheri, Jessie,
and I was in the office, talking and I told Cheri she ought to write
me a letter.  She asked why and I said because you write 'em to my mom
all the time.  She said why don't I write her one.  So, by May 1, I am
supposed to write her a 3 page letter.  She doesn't think I will do
it.  I'll show her.  Then Jessy wanted one so I am going to write her
2 pages.  And I will write 2 pages to Emily.  I also need to start on
my rought draft for English.  I also need to make a Solomon's Temple
for extra credit in History.  Well, that's my life up to this point.

<p>I just wrote 2 letters.  To Christy and Erika.  I just got one from
Lila.  You know what?  Lila is awesome!  I love her personality and
she's into guys and sex and she gives good back massages... Wow!  And
I'm gonna get her at OKC.  I can't believe she's 15 though.  I would
swear she's older than me.  goodnight. 10:28</p>
