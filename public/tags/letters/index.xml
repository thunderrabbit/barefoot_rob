Yesterday when I called Christina she was gone. When I called Charmain, she didn&#39;t want to do anything. so I rode around at the school. Today I went to church. Jessica, Cheri, and Emily were there. We talked about AIDS. Dad brought some rubbers there to show us them and teach us about &#34;safe sex.&#34; As if we don&#39;t know.</description>

I just wrote 2 letters. To Christy and Erika. I just got one from Lila. You know what? Lila is awesome! I love her personality and she&#39;s into guys and sex and she gives good back massages... Wow! And I&#39;m gonna get her at OKC. I can&#39;t believe she&#39;s 15 though. I would swear she&#39;s older than me. goodnight. 10:28</description>
