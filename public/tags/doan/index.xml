      <description>18:43 Tuesday 09 June 2015 JST On my way down Takeshita street, I heard my name, looked up and saw Doan from Japanese class! Neat! He had just been studying and was looking for a bite to eat so we went to King Kebab on that street. Kebab munchin&amp;rsquo; we headed to the toy store to check out the goods!
We played with a marble track thing which has about a 70% success rate, which I guess is pretty good for being made of building blocks.</description>
