      <description>12:54 Friday 30 March 2018 JST Actually have gotten three (3) meetings done online: Prentiss and Ari helped with Mankind Project Tokyo; Ari said he will write some stuff for either Mankind Project Tokyo Meetup or My Power Circle. Oriane and I checked in with each other on our respective projects.
Planning to ask which inkan I can use for my personal seal today; maybe I will go do that now on my way to work at TY.</description>

      <description>10:54 Friday 16 December 2016 JST From getting started with kakoune via https://kakoune.org
brew install homebrew/dupes/ncurses  Then, to install
brew install --HEAD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mawww/kakoune/master/contrib/kakoune.rb  11:09 Okay I&amp;rsquo;ve just installed kakoune and am using it to type this sentence. Funny that it requires pressing the control key to select suggested words. Seems like down-arrow would be sufficient but maybe the arrow keys are too far away from keyboard.</description>
