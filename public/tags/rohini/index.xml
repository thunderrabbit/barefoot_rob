      <description>13:39 Tuesday 07 November 2017 JST Okay it&amp;rsquo;s been a couple days, but we had a lovely weekend in Shimoda. So glad that Lin joined us! She said she had a great time. The weekend schedule was kinda freestyle, which caused a bit of consternation for some, but did not affect things too badly. I enjoyed getting to know everyone a bit better.
Yoga on Saturday morning was originally led by Lisa, but turned into acro yoga with people being angels, superman, partners, flippers, etc.</description>

We went to the caves apparently dug by hand with a bunch of different statues (33?</description>
