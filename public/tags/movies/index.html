<p>Watched <em>The Peanuts Movie</em>; it was cute and great!  I liked how they
brought in all the old stories and combined them nicely into a nice
believable story.</p>

<p>Watching 007 <em>Spectre</em> now; slightly less believable.  ;-)</p>

<h2 id="12-51-wednesday-03-february-2016-jst">12:51 Wednesday 03 February 2016 JST</h2>

<p><em>Spectre</em> was pretty okay, though the video started to skip near the end
so I turned it off and turned on <em>The Martian</em>, which I really
enjoyed, partially because it stars Matt Damon.</p>

<p>Just under 2 hours to Narita.</p>

<p>Lin and I watched <a href="https://www.jinni.com/movies/youve-got-mail/">You&rsquo;ve Got Mail</a>, which I had never previously seen.  Meg Ryan&rsquo;s character reminded me a lot of Wende, both because she reminded me of Wende and because Wende likes Meg Ryan.</p>

<p>I rated the movie as &ldquo;great&rdquo; on <a href="https://www.jinni.com/">Jinni, my favorite movie rating site</a>, though I have typed jenni.com many times when searching for it.</p>

<p>When I got home from the iOS meeting, Lin was watching Shawshank Redemption on TV via our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_On_demand">video-on-demand</a> service. I joined her once the final rape scene was over; up to that point, I don&rsquo;t really like the movie. When the final credits rolled, I said, &ldquo;oh, I thought that was Tom Hanks,&rdquo; and she was like, &ldquo;no that was Green Mile.&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen Green Mile,&rdquo; and she goes WHAT?? and I was like, WHAT??? and she was like WHAT???? and I was like WHAT??? for about a minute.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s been wanting to see A.I. as well so she went and rented A.I. and Green Mile for 100 yen each.   I chose to watch A.I. instead of Green Mile last night because A.I. is shorter, and I&rsquo;ve never known Lin to watch an entire movie (late at night on our couch) without sleeping.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen A.I. a couple of times, and when I watch it, I always think of Chez who was really moved by the movie.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t cry this time while watching it, though I have in the past.</p>

<p>We did watch the &ldquo;making of A.I.&rdquo; this time, whereas I hadn&rsquo;t in the past.  I wonder <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+kubrick+died">how Kubrick died</a> (<em>he types, while seated in front of a portal with high speed access to essentially all of humankind&rsquo;s information</em>).</p>

<p>I was reminded of an interesting article about Kubrick&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Shining&rdquo; as his confession that he helped make footage for Apollo 11 missions.   <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kubrick+shining+apollo+11">kubrick+shining+apollo+11/a&gt;</a></p>

<p>Lin and I watched the Kill Bills today.  She enjoys movies a lot; one of her ways of enjoying them is falling asleep in front of them.  Apparently she had seen the opening scene of Kill Bill, but didn&rsquo;t remember any of the rest.</p>

<p>I prodded her awake as needed and she quite enjoyed the movies!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.snakesonaplane.com">Snakes on a Plane</a></p>

<p>is pretty much a ridiculous movie, but I guess it could give a few shocky moments to those afraid to fly or those afraid hang out with snakes, or those simply afraid to do both at the same time.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a few funny lines, well one&hellip; but it wasn&rsquo;t memorable enough for me to remember it.  I do remember a great slew of things that simply could not have happened.</p>

<p>Snakes would not be all chipper while basically freezing their tails off in cargo hold, and Myth Busters proved that a gunshot in a pressurized plane won&rsquo;t do what it does in the movies, and the swooping recovery from watery death seemed a bit&hellip; hollywood.</p>

<p>I say don&rsquo;t see it on the big screen, but it&rsquo;s worth a laugh at a slumber party.</p>

<p>Just saw most of Patch Adams starring Robin Williams.? I was surprised when The Girl died; I saw she was going to have an issue, and wondered how it would be resolved.? How could ol&rsquo; Patch say &ldquo;now now; play nice,&rdquo; after the incident, but I guess by killing both involved, it&rsquo;s not an issue.</p>

<p>Kudos to the real Patch Adams for having the courage to be different and silly.</p>

<p>This is a really silly movie that has us almost continuously in stitches.  So many mixed up movie references, plus hilarious dialogue in itself.</p>

<p>We weren&rsquo;t laughing as much at the very end, but it&rsquo;s a funny movie.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.kungpowmovie.com/swf/KPmain.html">website</a> includes a [Dub Your Own Flick] link in the top center.  I assume a <em>lot</em> of time could be spent there!!!</p>

<p><a href="https://robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&amp;date=2005/09/27#Star_Wars_III">Star Wars III</a></p>

<p>Nice movie.  I loved the monsters and lava and the final fight
scenes.  The classic scene of heros (fighting anti-heros) on a raft
about to go over the waterfall piqued my senses when that water was a
river of lava.  How incredible.</p>

<p>The transition of Anakin&rsquo;s body into a burned mess was quite
believable.  I can see why he would have risked attacking from the low
position, and how he fucked up doing it.  Lava burning off the suit
and not actually burning the entire body was definitely believable.
Very Jedi for Obi-wan to leave instead of kill his previous prey.</p>

<p>The transition from Darth Vader as burned mess to wearing a black
suit seemed a bit too fast.  But I enjoyed wearing the mask for a
second.  Red tints his vision forever after.  No wonder he is so
angry!</p>

<p>And man, when Darth Vader first breathed&hellip;  Woah.  I remember
that noise.</p>

<p>Not quite as amazing when he first spoke.  Not&hellip;. a believable
transition, I guess.  Too abrupt, maybe.</p>

<p>I (being a great movie director) would have had the newly costumed
Darth Vader say something like, &ldquo;shit, I can&rsquo;t feel Padme&rsquo;s presence
anywhere,&rdquo; to explain why he might agree she was dead.  She could have
just died and he just come alive and it woulda been perfect.</p>

<p>Also, I was surprised at how quickly Anakin broke his allegiance
when Mace Windu was killed.  I don&rsquo;t remember the scene exactly, but
the switcharoo seemed pretty quick.</p>

<p>How did Darth Sidious plant a code 66 in all his fighters?  Were they his
army?  That set of scenes was fuckin&rsquo; scary.  I was glad to have some
pre-knowledge of who must live.</p>

<p>I liked the explanation for why storm troopers are used in episode
IV.  Not that they didn&rsquo;t have the CGI technology in the 70s, er, the
future, but that Darth Sidious had all droids shut down.  But I don&rsquo;t
otherwise why he would do that.</p>

<p>If C-3P0&rsquo;s memory gets wiped, I don&rsquo;t get how he will recognize
R2D2 when they are reunited on Tatooine.  And why do they end up
there?  I may have missed that.</p>

<p>I liked the fight between Yoda and Darth Sidious.  It wasn&rsquo;t as surprising
as the one with Count Dooku (sp) in the previous movie, but still
cool.  I like how they didn&rsquo;t try to make it More Than the previous
fight.  They made it just the right amount of cool.  Oh, and when Yoda
walked into the room and those red cats tried to stop him but just
crumpled&hellip;  that was money.</p>

<p>In the final scene, good job on the image of Uncle Owen watching
two suns set.  Just like the first movie.  Uh, I mean the next
one.</p>

<p>Oh, and Leia really looked like Leia and Uncle Owen did too.
Great casting.  Not as difficult to find non-speaking actors, I
guess, but still cool.</p>

<br><font size=-1>movie started at 4:30</font>

<p>Wende and I saw Lethal Weapon 4, and it was really good.

<p>I was quite impressed with the script and scenarios and stuff.  It was only predictable in that the good guys didn't die.  Otherwise it kept me riveted and laughing.

<p>Wende gripped my hand so tightly that her fingers fell asleep.
"I certainly had to flex them to get feeling back into them," she said.

<p>The movie was great, especially for a #4 in a series.  Wow!!

<p><hr align="left" width="25%">

<p>After the movie, we had a great heart-to-heart discussion for 2.25 hours about us and life and ourselves and goals and fears and relationships and stuff.  I feel greatly honored that Wende and I can talk about these things, even though it is difficult.

<p>At one point, I cried during our conversation, when describing my fears that quitting my job was the wrong thing to do and that I would not be able to make enough money otherwise.
<br>I am pleased that I can cry when I need to.
