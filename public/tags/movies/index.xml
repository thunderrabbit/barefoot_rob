      <description>08:43 Wednesday 03 February 2016 JST Watched The Peanuts Movie; it was cute and great! I liked how they brought in all the old stories and combined them nicely into a nice believable story.
Watching 007 Spectre now; slightly less believable. ;-)
12:51 Wednesday 03 February 2016 JST Spectre was pretty okay, though the video started to skip near the end so I turned it off and turned on The Martian, which I really enjoyed, partially because it stars Matt Damon.</description>

      <description>##18:02 Wednesday 20 March 2013
Lin and I watched You&amp;rsquo;ve Got Mail, which I had never previously seen. Meg Ryan&amp;rsquo;s character reminded me a lot of Wende, both because she reminded me of Wende and because Wende likes Meg Ryan.
I rated the movie as &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo; on Jinni, my favorite movie rating site, though I have typed jenni.com many times when searching for it.</description>

When I got home from the iOS meeting, Lin was watching Shawshank Redemption on TV via our video-on-demand service. I joined her once the final rape scene was over; up to that point, I don&amp;rsquo;t really like the movie. When the final credits rolled, I said, &amp;ldquo;oh, I thought that was Tom Hanks,&amp;rdquo; and she was like, &amp;ldquo;no that was Green Mile.&amp;rdquo; I was like, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen Green Mile,&amp;rdquo; and she goes WHAT?</description>

Lin and I watched the Kill Bills today. She enjoys movies a lot; one of her ways of enjoying them is falling asleep in front of them. Apparently she had seen the opening scene of Kill Bill, but didn&amp;rsquo;t remember any of the rest.
I prodded her awake as needed and she quite enjoyed the movies!</description>

 It was linear, things happened, and I experienced moments of tension and interest.

Snakes on a Plane
is pretty much a ridiculous movie, but I guess it could give a few shocky moments to those afraid to fly or those afraid hang out with snakes, or those simply afraid to do both at the same time.
There&amp;rsquo;s a few funny lines, well one&amp;hellip; but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t memorable enough for me to remember it. I do remember a great slew of things that simply could not have happened.</description>

Just saw most of Patch Adams starring Robin Williams.? I was surprised when The Girl died; I saw she was going to have an issue, and wondered how it would be resolved.? How could ol&amp;rsquo; Patch say &amp;ldquo;now now; play nice,&amp;rdquo; after the incident, but I guess by killing both involved, it&amp;rsquo;s not an issue.
Kudos to the real Patch Adams for having the courage to be different and silly.</description>

Kung Pow: Enter The Fist
This is a really silly movie that has us almost continuously in stitches. So many mixed up movie references, plus hilarious dialogue in itself.
We weren&amp;rsquo;t laughing as much at the very end, but it&amp;rsquo;s a funny movie.
The website includes a [Dub Your Own Flick] link in the top center. I assume a lot of time could be spent there!</description>

Star Wars III
Nice movie. I loved the monsters and lava and the final fight scenes. The classic scene of heros (fighting anti-heros) on a raft about to go over the waterfall piqued my senses when that water was a river of lava. How incredible.
The transition of Anakin&amp;rsquo;s body into a burned mess was quite believable. I can see why he would have risked attacking from the low position, and how he fucked up doing it.</description>

      <description>Lethal Weapon 4
4:30pm Saturday 18 July 1998
movie started at 4:30 Wende and I saw Lethal Weapon 4, and it was really good. I was quite impressed with the script and scenarios and stuff. It was only predictable in that the good guys didn&#39;t die. Otherwise it kept me riveted and laughing. Wende gripped my hand so tightly that her fingers fell asleep. &#34;I certainly had to flex them to get feeling back into them,&#34;</description>
