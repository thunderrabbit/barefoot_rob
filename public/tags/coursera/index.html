<p>In the TESOL course, they just presented a story about a smart guy who
tried to learn a language just from books, and no practice.  I can&rsquo;t
imagine it&rsquo;s as literally true as they&rsquo;ve presented it, but the point
is clear.  Books don&rsquo;t talk back. (*)</p>

<p>(*) Yes, I mean the old kind of books, the ones that were just made of paper and stuff.</p>

<pre><code>IQ might be correlated with learning a language in that a person with
high IQ may be able to memorize a lot of grammar rules, exceptions,
pronunciation guides, etc.  This person can more easily become
well-read on the language, but not actually be able to *use* the
language in a real situation.

But I do not think IQ is related to acquiring a language.  Acquiring a
language requires practice and simply attempting to speak without
concern of one's errors.

In one of the recent videos, it was suggested that people with high IQ
want to maintain their appearance of being smart and therefore are
less willing to make mistakes required for language acquisition.  I
ain't so sure that IQ is the primary indicator of unwillingness to
make mistakes.

<p>Here&rsquo;s my answer to the statement &ldquo;What is taught is what is learned&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>What is taught is definitely not what is learned.  Students focus
on whatever they focus on.  The instructor may be talking about
blah blah blah, but the student might be focusing on their navel,
their cellphone, etc.  In this case, what is taught is for naught.
As we learned early in this course, students are busy forming
their opinions about the teacher's ability to teach instead of the
topic itself, and that's just in the first 6 seconds of class.

So imagine the case where the students love the instructor and
hang on his/her every word and nuance.  Even then, each individual
student has their own unique way of perceiving the world.  Through
life experiences, our perceptions are colored/filtered via our
past, which is unique for every person.

Only for infants, starting with a blank slate of experiences, are
their perceptions unfiltered.  But in that case, there's too much
information and not enough context for the infant to know what's
what.

The above examples are all the extremes.  In the optimal
situation, students enjoy the class, enjoy learning, and have just
the right life experiences to focus on exactly what the teacher
hopes to teach.  Assume these students do their best to acquire
the language, working outside the class, in their own time,
possibly in 'real life' situations.  They study and practice and
sooner than later, improve their skills. but that was due to their
practice more than what was taught.

<p>I started the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/outline">Learning how to
Learn</a>
course on Coursera this morning, and was able to correctly answer most
of the questions without watching the videos.  I queued three videos
to watch while out at Higashi-Nakano today, but forgot my earphones,
so might not be able to (unless I do it between lessons, which I
might).</p>
