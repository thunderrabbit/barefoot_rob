      <description>17:39 Tuesday 30 April 2019 JST Today Lin and I drove to Travis and Yumi&amp;rsquo;s place to hang out with them and Sakura. Johan was already there and Deji came a bit later. Nice to see everyone again, though in some ways it&amp;rsquo;s like the tribe is getting smaller (and larger!)
No BBQ today due to rain, but we made 手巻き with chicken, eggs, salad, and then ice cream at the end.</description>
