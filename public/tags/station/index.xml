Still fucking shaking with anger. I saw an old man grab a woman&#39;s ass just as her train arrived. He tried to run so I grabbed him and brought him back to her. She was like thank you and got on the train! Yo lady don&#39;t leave me hanging with this fucker; he grabbed your ass. so I yelled at him and let him go, never to see her again and a bunch people wondering wtf crazy barefoot mf yelling about.</description>
