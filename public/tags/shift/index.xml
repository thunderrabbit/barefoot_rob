      <description>21:51 Friday 24 August 2018 JST I took the course tonight with my ex-crush new-coach Anikiko. She created the course 7 (seven) days ago and it started tonight. It will run for 3 weeks and I actually think I will invite some people to join.
If you have a budding project ready to jump out of you, I judge this program will get you moving.
It has already gotten me moving through just the first hour.</description>
