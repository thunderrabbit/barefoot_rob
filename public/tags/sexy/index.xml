      <description>01:15 Saturday 23 January 2016 PST A-star is my suggested name based on the (stage) name for the woman who greeted us first in a topless bar. I liked her smile and eyes so the third time she came up to me to see if we could go for a private dance, I took her up on it.
We talked about her other talents in art and teaching people (how) to do their own art.</description>
