<p>I bought a book that has become my todo book.  It&rsquo;s as portable as my
phone and even more reliable in terms of battery power.  I bought it
on Tuesday and have used it daily since then.  Wow four days in total.</p>

<p>So far I have used a single page per day.  (It&rsquo;s 91mm x 160mm x 6mm,
featuring 96 pages and two covers within the 6mm thickness.  It&rsquo;s
about the same size as my phone.)  If I keep going at the current
rate, (one side of paper per day,) it should last 6 months.</p>

<p>I finally got Margaret&rsquo;s book on its way back to her.  She lent it to
me years ago.. like 8 years and said she would like to have it back
sometime..  and then our group ended and she left the country.</p>

<p>Funny that after I reached her and got her address yesterday, I
suddenly had the desire to read the book to my GG class.  I thought
they would get a kick out of it, but <em>actually</em>&hellip; I was hoping to get
a kick out of being such a good guy for sending the book back and
reading such an interesting book to the class.  Fuck that.  It&rsquo;s
Margaret&rsquo;s book and she apparently has a 7 year old waiting to have it
read.  Sent it today.</p>

<p>I received via snail mail the hardcopy version of
<a href="www.krimms.com/download/rollerdog.pdf">Rollerdog</a> I
<a href="https://krimms.com/buybook/">purchased from Krimms</a>.  It looks
beautiful in its pristine packaging.  I haven&rsquo;t opened it yet, and
probably won&rsquo;t open it until further notice&hellip; though I&rsquo;ll email him
and ask if there&rsquo;s anything he put in the book specifically for me.</p>

<p>I just finished Mike&rsquo;s latest book, <em>The Last</em>.  It&rsquo;s a really
interesting story set in the real world, just three years from now.
Quite an easy read except for the queasy parts which I almost had to
put down!  The story leaves some unanswered questions, and lends
itself to more books, which I hope he writes soon!</p>

<p>I was surprised by the plot twists; it seemed so simple at first!
Interesting to wonder what I would do if I found myself in the main
character&rsquo;s situation: the last man alive in a city full of zombies!!</p>

<p>The story is not as complex as Mike&rsquo;s other work, and focuses on just
a couple main characters (not counting the rarely-distinguishable
zombies of course!)  It&rsquo;s primarily written in first person, and what
a ride!</p>

<p>Looking forward to the world more fleshed out; hopefully the series
will be a detailed mega-thriller!</p>
