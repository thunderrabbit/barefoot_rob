<p>I put a question mark on the title because I cannot really prove the
visions are related to past lives, but this is a fun way to guide
people through a process to see what could be their past lives.</p>

<pre><code>Each participant gets into a relaxed position, usually either
sitting in a chair, or laying down, or otherwise sitting against
something comfortable.

Spend a few minutes leading the participants through a relaxation
process, whereby they let their bodies relax and keep their minds
awake.  Once they are in this mind awake / body asleep mode,
invite them to imagine getting up and leaving the room.  Guide
them to imagine traveling far away, whether by vehicle, or through
a cave, or through a forest, or by any other means which takes
them from the familiar, to the unfamiliar, and guide them to
arrive somewhere new, yet familiar.

Give the participants a chance to explore the familiar area,
including seeing other inhabitants of the area and moving around
and communicating with them.

Once they have explored the area, lead the participants gently
back the way they came, allowing them to have a clear memory of
what happened and what they heard and saw. (say things like
&quot;coming back slowly, you clearly remember what you experienced,&quot;
etc) Once their awareness focuses back on their physical bodies,
give them a chance to write down what they experienced.  Do not
speak until everyone is pretty much done writing.

The whole process is a state of light hypnosis, and everyone will
still have full control and awareness of where their physical body
is.  They will be able to come back in a moment's notice if they
choose.

Each process will take about 20 or 30 minutes.

<p>Dreamhosts lists their server key as something like</p>

<p>canyonville.dreamhost.com,64.90.48.21 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABA&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>But in order to install it on my Brother printer for its scan-to-sftp
function, the key needed to start with ssh-rsa.  So I removed
&ldquo;canyonville&hellip;..21&rdquo; from the front of the key and it works fine.</p>

<p>ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCnJdr5AbHwfaU+F+pv4BzcgNnPBBvbCh7&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>Is Dreamhost confused about how to show their server keys?  Is Brother
behind the times in accepting latest standards?</p>

<p>Dunno, but the printer can scan to my image server again.</p>

                        <p>Have you ever found yourself flying like a bird, only to later realize
it was a dream?</p>

<p>Have you been chased by &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; or haunted by scary situations in
your dreams?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucid dreaming&rdquo; is a state of dreaming while being aware that you are
dreaming.  Lucid dreaming allows me to have more fun flying dreams and
fewer scary dreams.  This is how I got started:</p>

<p>There are a few techniques I have used at different times of my life.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start a dream journal.  Prepare a notebook and pen, and leave it
next to you when you go to sleep.  Immediately upon waking, write
down <em>anything</em> that you can recall.  A sketch, a sentence, even a
single drawn line or single word can help.  This process of writing
or drawing helps connect your waking conscious mind with your
dreaming mind.</li>
</ol>

<p>Do this consistently over some weeks or months and you will soon
   have more to write than you possibly have time for upon waking.</p>

<ol>
<li>Check to see if you are dreaming.  There are several different ways
to do so.  Do one or more of these tests throughout the day, like
every hour or so.  Eventually you will do a test while dreaming
and find yourself lucid dreaming!</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Test 1</em>: Read this sentence.  Read it again.  Close your eyes for a
   few seconds.  Open your eyes and read it again.  Did it change?
   No?  Then you are probably not dreaming.</p>

<p>Did the sentence change?  Then you are dreaming.  Congratulations!</p>

<p><em>Test two</em>: Stand up.  Look up toward a point way up above you and
   jump to it.  Did you come back down?  Then you are probably not
   dreaming.</p>

<p>Did you stay in the air or fly to that point?  You are
   dreaming!</p>

<p><em>Test three</em>: Count your fingers.  Count them again.  Do you have the
   normal number?  Can you do it easily?  You are probably not
   dreaming.</p>

<p>Do you have extra fingers than normal?  Fewer fingers than normal?
   Congratulations, you are dreaming!  (Or you may have just had an
   accident.  Call emergency services!)</p>

<p>One other technique I have read is to fall asleep with the intention
of being aware in your dreams.  I personally have not had success with
this technique, but it may work for you.</p>

<p>Do you keep a dream journal?  Do you have any other techniques to
share?  Email me at rob <strong>α𝐭</strong> robnugen.com to let me know!</p>
