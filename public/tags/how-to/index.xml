      <description>I put a question mark on the title because I cannot really prove the visions are related to past lives, but this is a fun way to guide people through a process to see what could be their past lives.
Each participant gets into a relaxed position, usually either sitting in a chair, or laying down, or otherwise sitting against something comfortable. Spend a few minutes leading the participants through a relaxation process, whereby they let their bodies relax and keep their minds awake.</description>

      <description>13:07 Thursday 08 August 2019 JST Dreamhosts lists their server key as something like
canyonville.dreamhost.com,64.90.48.21 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABA&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
But in order to install it on my Brother printer for its scan-to-sftp function, the key needed to start with ssh-rsa. So I removed &amp;ldquo;canyonville&amp;hellip;..21&amp;rdquo; from the front of the key and it works fine.
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCnJdr5AbHwfaU+F+pv4BzcgNnPBBvbCh7&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
Is Dreamhost confused about how to show their server keys? Is Brother behind the times in accepting latest standards?</description>

&amp;ldquo;Lucid dreaming&amp;rdquo; is a state of dreaming while being aware that you are dreaming. Lucid dreaming allows me to have more fun flying dreams and fewer scary dreams. This is how I got started:
There are a few techniques I have used at different times of my life.</description>
