      <description>07:59 Saturday 11 April 2015 JST In a slightly enclosed area, Travis and I were playing a version of baseball. We would each take one turn at bat, and keep track of where our ghost players had made it around the bases. We were pretty well tied, though we kept getting hits. It was my turn at bat, and someone gave me a broken bat as a joke, so I used it as a joke and got a pretty good hit, making it to third base, though Travis tagged home base before my ghost runner would have made it there.</description>
