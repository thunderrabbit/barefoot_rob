      <description>17:37 Tuesday 30 October 2018 JST Still going through MLAPHP for the AB project. I guess I am about halfway through the step of naming all the class definition files so they can be loaded via the autoloader.
During this process I found Mabl which features a short domain name and some tools for automated testing. Pretty easy onboarding, and they are giving the site a good onceover every day.</description>
