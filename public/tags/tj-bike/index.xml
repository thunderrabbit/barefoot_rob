      <description>06:34 Wednesday 08 May 2019 JST I rode TJ Bike to the bicycle parking lot today. This is the first time I have done so for work, given that we got our bicycle parking passes during Golden Week, and this is the first day that I have to work outside the house.
I usually allow 24 minutes to walk leisurely to the station. Riding TJ Bike &amp;ldquo;leisurely&amp;rdquo; down a big hill, I arrived at the bicycle parking area in 8 minutes.</description>
