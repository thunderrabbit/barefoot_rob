      <description>21:11 Wednesday 15 November 2017 JST As usual, my phone battery is low after not having charged it today. I charged it at JB the past few weeks but forgot tonight.
My computer battery is charged, so I can read Michael John Grist&amp;rsquo;s rewrite of Sen&amp;rsquo;s adventures in The Saint&amp;rsquo;s Rise.
I am on page 170 or so out of 470 and had hoped to finish by 20 November. hmm.</description>
