      <description>13:07 Thursday 08 August 2019 JST Dreamhosts lists their server key as something like
canyonville.dreamhost.com,64.90.48.21 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABA&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
But in order to install it on my Brother printer for its scan-to-sftp function, the key needed to start with ssh-rsa. So I removed &amp;ldquo;canyonville&amp;hellip;..21&amp;rdquo; from the front of the key and it works fine.
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCnJdr5AbHwfaU+F+pv4BzcgNnPBBvbCh7&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
Is Dreamhost confused about how to show their server keys? Is Brother behind the times in accepting latest standards?</description>

      <description>16:35 Thursday 01 February 2018 JST Today I did 1.5 hours of live stream to get about 1 second of new video added to Dragonframe&amp;rsquo;s ongoing take.
In the foreground on the left, the cutter cut a piece (I decided to redo about 7 frames to get his cut lined up properly) which the gluer glued into place. In the foreground on the right, the 8th rib is being put into place.</description>

I chatted with 三木（みき）in English, and his friend talked about the organization whose name includes a pronunciation pun on the phrase &amp;ldquo;innovate yourself&amp;rdquo;</description>
