      <description>18:40 Tuesday 13 October 2015 JST I solved the chain tree and the tetrahedron today at the toy store. They both vexed me last week and maybe the week before. But today I was like rar and luckily solved the tetrahedron, and systematically solved the chain tree.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t memorize either solution, but I probably won&amp;rsquo;t try to do them again, either.</description>
