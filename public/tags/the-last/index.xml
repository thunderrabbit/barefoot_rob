      <description>17:45 Sunday 03 May 2015 JST I just finished Mike&amp;rsquo;s latest book, The Last. It&amp;rsquo;s a really interesting story set in the real world, just three years from now. Quite an easy read except for the queasy parts which I almost had to put down! The story leaves some unanswered questions, and lends itself to more books, which I hope he writes soon!
I was surprised by the plot twists; it seemed so simple at first!</description>
