      <description>(adapted from my note last night to Mark)
I went to a stand-up comedy open mic tonight and ended up doing a set (my first ever!)
Several jokes went well, a couple did not; one of those is not recoverable in any way I can think of.
Soness said it was really good that I used contents of the room for several of my bits.

      <description>11:36 Monday 09 October 2017 JST Lin likes dogs, so I plan to preview this movie to see if she&amp;rsquo;d like it.
11:41 Monday 09 October 2017 JST Just for the record, there were approximately 5 minutes of ads before the movie started after I pressed play.
11:58 Monday 09 October 2017 JST I turned it off. Bailey was poorly trained.</description>
