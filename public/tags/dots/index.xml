10 November 1998
Cool! I powered up my old PC: 486 33MhZ with 8 megs of ram, and was looking for a cool old file when I came across some of my old programs. One is Dots, which I wrote in &#34;The Spring of 1990&#34; (as it says in the help menu) and I&#39;m sure it was written in Pascal. &#34;Dots?&#34; To play, draw a grid of dots and each player takes turns drawing lines between adjacent dots either vertically or horizontally.</description>
