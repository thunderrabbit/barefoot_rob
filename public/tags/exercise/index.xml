      <description>07:46 Friday 07 September 2018 JST Walked this morning for the first time in a week or so oops. Good times, including meeting the guy who I usually meet on Wednesdays while he is on his exercise route. Oh, and nodded to the kid who runs around the neighborhood as well.</description>

      <description>07:19 Wednesday 15 August 2018 JST I woke up several times last night like 3am, 4am, and then ended up waking up at 5:30am instead of 5am for my walk. Got out of the house bleary eyed by 5:45 am and headed toward かさはら&amp;rsquo;s place. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t outside (and I was 45 minutes later than the previous day) so I strolled on past and walked up stairs to the right and met a man who I ended up exercising with in a park (Takaishi Dai 3 Park, according to Google Maps).</description>

      <description>01:41 Wednesday 30 August 2017 JST I walked for 2 hours from NB lesson to Yoyogi Park. I had 2 hours total and Google said it would take 1 hour and 45 minutes. I stopped once to get a snack and a drink (and to change from pants to shorts) and then stopped again to buy a 2 liter bottle of tea. Made it to Yoyogi Park with 2 minutes to spare.</description>
