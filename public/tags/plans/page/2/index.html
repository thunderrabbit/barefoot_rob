<p>This is my optimal environment, or aspects of environment that I would
love and feel energized living within.</p>

<p>My bedroom is only accessible via a ladder or a rope swing, and a
small portal of some sort.  The hand holds are just the right size for
me to use.  Any guests have to be determined to enter before they'll
be willing to go to such extremes.</p>

<p>In my room there is no phone unless I take my cell pone with me.</p>

<p>Outside there are craggy bluffs and a hill or valley, with bushes and cacti
and trees to climb.  Big open area to play frisbee, open enough to throw, if
not open enough to run and catch it.</p>

<p>Wind blows friskily through the trees an around the bluffs, allowing for fun
lofting frisbee games.</p>

<p>My house has paints and brushes on one wall, and people are invited to
create art on it.  One other wall is left only for me to create upon.  The
guest art wall is photographed and thereby archived when it gets full, then
is repainted white or some silly sponge yellow or light gray.</p>

<p>Windows have stained glass art in them.  Maybe it's fake stained glass, just
painted.  yes; I need some of that.</p>

<p>One other wall has a water fountain built in, with tubes that people can
move around to bring water to the top, and make different configurations of
splashable water cascading pools on the way down.</p>

<p>This might have to be outside.</p>

<p>The doors are often open, and always unlocked.  My bike is attached
to the wall, ready to roll at any minute.  As well as my skates and
frisbee, a hackey sack, and kite maybe.  There is a room for crafts,
which always has a project ongoing.  paper clock is finished and on
the wall.  Marble track has its own table.  Other random projects are
around.</p>

<p>healthy snacky food is available from everywhere.  something I can
just snack on indefinitely.  and water is close at hand as well.  fish
tank built into one wall, maintained by my fish tank maintainer, not
me.</p>

<p>one room has books and beanbags in it.  and pillows.</p>

As of earlier this month, I became totally debt free.
Well, except for a $4000 medical bill that I still owe as a result of Wild Skating Adventure Six, totally debt free.
<p>
I&rsquo;m a financial anomaly in this society!
<p>
As for the 4 grand, I&rsquo;m probably not going to pay it off really fast- just pay several dollars per month to keep &lsquo;em off my back. Instead, I&rsquo;m saving up all my dollars for my Extended Remix Roadtrip that will begin in about August 1998.  (God that seems so far away!!!)
<p>
I&rsquo;m going to purchase a vehicle and new skates and a new bicycle and camping gear and a small tent or maybe just a sleeping bag tent thing (whatever they are called) and I&rsquo;m going to drive around, half camping, half staying at friends&rsquo; houses and stuff.
<p>
At this point, my trip is only in the planning stages. I have an itenerary sketched out: start in Houston, go up to Tomball to see my dad, then to College Station to see my mom, then maybe to Austin to see my step sister Karina, who I&rsquo;ve known since long before our respective parents met.
Then up to Garland to see Carrie and then through Denton to say HI to Tamara.  Then through Oklahoma City and Tulsa over toward Springfield Missouri and then Jonesboro and Little Rock Arkansas.  Probably through Hot Springs Arkansas to check out the hot springs.
<p>
Then over to Radcliff Kentucky where I was born and then to Flat Top, West Virginia to see my dad&rsquo;s family, and probably park it there for the winter.
<p>
In the spring I&rsquo;ll emerge and probably drive west along the northern states (gotta go by Great America and that park in Sandusky (?) Ohio to ride The Raptor) and then swing down through Columbia, Missouri where I lived for 4 years, then to Colorado to see my friend Rocky (really that&rsquo;s his name) and then my brother in Las Cruces, New Mexico (if he&rsquo;s still attending school there).
Otherwise I&rsquo;ll just check out the latest craziness in Roswell.
<p>
Then check out the Grand Canyon and then Joshua Tree California and then to seem my friend Jen in Palm Springs.  Then San Francisco area and maybe I&rsquo;ll park it there for a while.
<p>
Now all of this is quite up for change at any minute.  That&rsquo;s the beauty of being free!!!!
