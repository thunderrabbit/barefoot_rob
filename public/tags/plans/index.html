                        <p>I have often wondered about ways to write journal entries on some small device and incorporate them into my online journal.</p>

<p>I used to use a Handspring Visor, until the foldable keyboard folded for the last time and the Visor perhaps got replaced with a laptop?  It had some way to sync, probably USB.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve got a handheld screen here with Swype keyboard, and I am writing this as an email to myself which I hope to remember to cut and paste into a full on my local file system and incorporate into my git repository for journal entries.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m headed to Rin&rsquo;s monthly planning workshop in Omotesando.  This will be my second time to attend, and I intend to focus on workshops and, curiously, my website.</p>

<p>I want to continue using my existing git repositories (one for the journal, and one for the site itself (because my journal has lasted longer and should stay intact as much as possible (plus I want to keep up my single word commit messages that tell a story, backwards), as if a repository in a fragile file system supports that) which includes the journal as a sub module), even though &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; is like &ldquo;just use Squarespace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sorry, nope. Not gonna use Squarespace or WordPress or Ghost.  I&rsquo;ll continue to use Hugo, markdown, and my choice of hosting providers.  I just need some adjustments to my theme.</p>

<p>Specifically, I&rsquo;d like to add some testimonials to my about page, find a nice design for my schedule of workshops and perhaps tweak my tags list to show how many entries are tagged with each tag.</p>

<p>Those changes are of the top of my head, but when it comes time to do them, I get caught up in minutae, like how to adjust the left padding on the border of some div.  Annoying.</p>

<p>Excitingly, I&rsquo;d also like to get feedback on how I can approach the detail of being in the US for three weeks in October.  Any way to continue workshop momentum?  Any need to?</p>

<p>Marble Track 3 is not my #1 priority; I am happy to work on it slowly.</p>

<p>*) Rewriting in Gatsby / React makes sense if I can learn along the
 path to creating it.  How do you feel about going slowly, to help an
 old newbie learn along the way?</p>

<p>Basically, I do the work, learning along the way, you get a per
month retainer, for minimum 5 months?</p>

<p>*) What income streams do you see for Marble Track 3?</p>

<p>*) I got a gatsby-driven blog skeleton going, but have not integrated
Airtable.</p>

<p>*) I ain&rsquo;t sold on Airtable yet; I was not even able to get a Hello
World working after 35 minutes of poking around at existing templates
and staring at the interface</p>

<p>*) currently I have scripts that make different image sizes (2 for
now, but more can be easily added)  Where do images get stored in your
setup?</p>

<p>Just a couple days ago I got my tickets all sorted to staff two
different NWTA weekends and also attend the MKP USA Face to Face
weekend in Texas.</p>

<p>After pretty much settling on the plans, it was pointed out that
attending an IGFT might give me more of the training I am looking for,
but I trust this is the training / trip I need.</p>

<p>The goal of all this is to deepen the (emotional) work we can do in
Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle, by improving my facilitation skills.  That will
thereby hopefully inspire more men to take facilitation roles in the
group.</p>

<p>In addition, we are beginning to translate one of the workshops into
Japanese so we can invite Japanese men into the work as well.  For
that part, I am asking Takeshi to lead and facilitate; maybe we should
do a trial run and then a small version, then a real version.</p>

<p>Though I have not figured out how to present it, I want to have some
pages that give a complete rundown of how the workers have made Marble
Track 3.</p>

<p>At this point, under /snippets, it starts like this:</p>

<pre><code>Squarehead leads Rabby onto the set as Rabby drags a round
circular plate behind him.

Squarehead unties the ropes from Rabby. Rabby squishes Squarehead as
he heads toward the camera, knocking it off its stand.

By the time the camera is reset, Squarehead has recovered and is
pulling the ropes out from under the wooden circle.

Lil brother comes onto the set, and wonders if he’s allowed to step on
the stage. He sees his mom, and thinks better of it. Other characters
pay the stage no mind and walk all across it.

Once the characters have arrived and greeted each other, Dr Sugar
comes in and thanks everyone for being there.

Mr McGlue comes in late, and big brother tells Lil brother to wait his
turn. Big brother punches Lil brother and runs away.

Then everyone except Candy Mama and Dr Sugar run away as spooky
skeleton Garinoppi comes onto the set. Lil Brother inexplicably floats
up into the air.
</code></pre>

<p>I want the moments to be linked to specific timestamps in specific
videos online (currently, Youtube).  I also want photos of the
moments, embedded in the text.</p>

<p>I think the best way to do this will be with a data document that Hugo
can parse.  I will have to maintain the data file by hand for the
foreseeable future; I don&rsquo;t know of any other way to get the data.</p>

<p>I am in the middle of making the marble splitter work for small
marbles.</p>

<p>The manager has just glued one rail into place and will glue the inner
rail next.</p>

<p>Next, the manager will:</p>

<ul>
<li>glue inner rail for small track</li>
<li>test the too small marble (which will fail)</li>
<li>eject too small marble</li>
<li>test a correctly-sized small marble</li>
</ul>

<p>At the same time, Reversable Guy (RG) will place the other splitter
top rail.  Only problem is holding it in place before there are
supports for it.</p>

<p>Reversable Guy will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lift the rail</li>
<li>Get help from Pinky</li>
<li>Call in some brown worms to act as supports</li>
<li>Have Green Cutter(*) cut support
pieces to size and glue them in place.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pinky will:</p>

<ul>
<li>help RG with the rail</li>
<li>install some kind of berm for the large marble</li>
</ul>

<p>Square head guy will:</p>

<ul>
<li>come back with the large marble</li>
<li>help Pinky with the berm OR/and</li>
<li>push the large marble up the ramp</li>
</ul>

<p>(*) He is Green Cutter for no reason other than he is completely
green, and he is the cutter.  There are no other cutters (yet) on the
set</p>

<p>Other things to be done:</p>

<ul>
<li>add berm to catch small marbles (near same place as the berm Pink
will add)</li>
<li>add curved rail which will guide medium sized marble off the
small/medium splitter</li>
<li>add small marble track extending clockwise from top of the three-way splitter</li>
<li>using curvable bamboo skewers, add medium+large marble track extending the other way from top of the
three-way splitter</li>
<li>carefully measure the circumfrence of the stage and calculate the
slope of the outer upper curved track so it will be <em>just</em> the right
height when it loops all the way around.</li>
<li>low-key add some ramps within the inside track which will double as
holders for this outer track.</li>
</ul>

<p>After writing the above, I think I should create a removable ring
track to be a stand-in for the actual track.  That way the inner track
will know exactly how high/low it needs to be a different places.</p>

<p>And <em>now</em> I think I am about ready to get a domain specifically for
this project.  Not sure how to have Hugo grab exactly one set of tags
to make entries though.  Is it too much trouble to maintain two
different sets of entries?  Can I do hardlinks in OS X?</p>

Japanese study, I hope to retool the bejeweled game so the pieces move
slower than light speed.  Oh, and try to find the light speed game for

relativistic effects.</p>

<p>I crossed out the items I finished today.  I need to draw a maze
because it&rsquo;s due in a few hours!!!  I don&rsquo;t have ny queued up at the
moment.</p>

<p>I fixed the Japanese apps but haven&rsquo;t resubmitted them.  It&rsquo;s such a
chore each time to repost all new screenshots etc omg.  Maybe I won&rsquo;t
have to and it will save all previous data.</p>

<p>I looked for the light speed game but couldn&rsquo;t find it for sure.</p>

<p>Worked on stuff for sbstrm instead of doing Bejeweled (or submitting
Japanese apps).</p>

<p>To do SSL, I popped both new.robnugen.com and b.robnugen.com onto
Cloudflare (single checkbox does it on Dreamhost&rsquo;s control panel)&hellip;
BUT then I couldn&rsquo;t connect via SSH to my accounts (without doing
something else apparently and I didn&rsquo;t want to look for it.. so &ldquo;bah&rdquo;
and I switched them back.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll do SSL when the new browser-backed free service comes online in a
few months.</p>

<p>On the train now headed for Chigasaki to hang out with Soness!  I
helped organize some of her paperwork so I&rsquo;m bringing that back now.
She&rsquo;s making yummy lunch!</p>

<p>The weather is lovely though cold; I&rsquo;m barefoot.  :-)</p>

<p>Things to do when I get back, or when I get back from Japan:</p>
<br>Step into an empty life and be willing to sit without
distractions. Be willing to look at possibility of creating a stable
wealthful life without a 40 hour per week job.</p>
<br>By doing this trip, in what ways am I running away?
<br>What am I running from?
