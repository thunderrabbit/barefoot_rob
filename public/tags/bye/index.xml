      <description>21:17 Monday 29 June 2015 JST Japanese class discussion ran a bit late and I felt anxious to prepare for work tomorrow so I left before the discussion had finished&amp;hellip; it sounded like it would go easily at least 20 more minutes.
I can see Lin&amp;rsquo;s concerns with the class; it&amp;rsquo;s great in some ways but isn&amp;rsquo;t really good for comprehensive learning. Gotta find a teacher / real class fo real.</description>

Using my new verb 手伝う, I asked Shibata if there was anything I could do to help around the store. She was like, &amp;ldquo;really?&amp;rdquo; and I go yeah! and ended up helping her make an image of a ship using stackable soft-plastic building blocks.
Shibata said she is leaving the toy store soon. Boooo. She&amp;rsquo;s gonna work somewhere in Tachikawa, so soon it&amp;rsquo;ll be さよなら time.</description>
