This is the kind of info that was floating around before the war in Iraq that everyone ignored and/or discounted, yet now wished they had not. This article is damn well-documented too. if you doubt what he is saying, just click on the links to go directly to the whitehouse website with the quotes he is referencing. Every American in the country should be required to read this.</description>

I do not buy that 911 was an inside job by the government. I can buy that the Neocons in the Bush admin potentially knew something was up and did nothing in order to create public sentiment that would rally behind the flag and agree to their extreme foriegn policy agenda, but that&amp;rsquo;s a far cry from orchestrating the event and attacking your own nation with missiles, etc.</description>

 With an absurd system for color-coding dangers to Americans, the President, Vice President, and the highest officials in this land were able to paint the media a &amp;ldquo;high&amp;rdquo; incendiary orange and the Democrats an &amp;ldquo;elevated&amp;rdquo; bright yellow, functionally sidelining them.
