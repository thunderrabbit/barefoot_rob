<p>This is the kind of info that was floating around before the war in Iraq that everyone ignored and/or discounted, yet now wished they had not.  This article is damn well-documented too.  if you doubt what he is saying, just click on the links to go directly to the whitehouse website with the quotes he is referencing.  Every American in the country should be <strong><em>required</em></strong> to read this.  People who still have Bush/Cheney&rsquo;04 stickers on their cars should be forced to read this until it sinks in. here&rsquo;s the teaser&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>**This is why the entire debate about the Iraq &ldquo;surge&rdquo; is as much a sideshow as Britney&rsquo;s scalp. More troops in Baghdad are irrelevant to what&rsquo;s going down in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The surge supporters who accuse the Iraq war&rsquo;s critics of emboldening the enemy are trying to deflect attention from their own complicity in losing a bigger battle: the one against the enemy that actually did attack us on <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>. Who lost Iraq? is but a distraction from the more damning question, Who is losing the war on terrorism? **</p>

<p>Here is the whole thing&hellip;</p>

<p>By <a href="https://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/frankrich/index.html?inline=nyt-per"> FRANK RICH</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;UNITED 93,&rdquo; Hollywood&rsquo;s highly praised but indifferently attended <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> docudrama, will be only a blip on tonight&rsquo;s Oscar telecast. The ratings rise of &ldquo;24&rdquo; has stalled as <a href="https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/02/19/8400166/index.htm"> audiences defect</a> from the downer of terrorists to the supernatural uplift of &ldquo;Heroes.&rdquo; Cable surfers have tuned out Iraq for a war with laughs: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/23/us/23smith.html"> the battle over Anna Nicole&rsquo;s decomposing corpse </a>. Set this cultural backdrop against last week&rsquo;s terrifying but little-heeded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/19/world/asia/19intel.html"> front-page Times account</a> of American &ldquo;intelligence and counterterrorism officials&rdquo; leaking urgent warnings about Al Qaeda&rsquo;s comeback, and ask yourself: Haven&rsquo;t we been here before?</p>

<p>If so, that would be the summer of 2001, when America pigged out on a <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> buffet of Gary Condit and <a href="https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F50A16FA3B550C768EDDA10894D9404482"> shark attacks</a> . The intelligence and counterterrorism officials back then were privately sounding urgent warnings like those in last week&rsquo;s Times, culminating in the President&rsquo;s Daily Brief titled &ldquo;Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S .&rdquo; The system &ldquo;<a href="https://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch8.htm">was blinking red</a>,&rdquo; as the C.I.A. chief George Tenet would later tell the <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> commission. But no one, from the White House on down, wanted to hear it.</p>

<p>The White House doesn&rsquo;t want to hear it now, either. That&rsquo;s why terrorism experts are trying to get its attention by going public, and not just through The Times. Michael Scheuer, the former head of the C.I.A. bin Laden unit, <a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17240518/">told MSNBC&rsquo;s Keith Olbermann last week</a> that the Taliban and Al Qaeda, having regrouped in Afghanistan and Pakistan, &ldquo;are going to detonate a nuclear device inside the United States&rdquo; (the real United States, that is, not the fictional stand-in where this same scenario can be found on &ldquo;24&rdquo;). Al Qaeda is &ldquo;on the march&rdquo; rather than on the run, the Georgetown University and <a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/pdfs/TUTC021407/Hoffman_Testimony021407.pdf">West Point terrorism expert Bruce Hoffman told Congress</a>. Tony Blair is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/22/world/middleeast/22blair.html">pulling troops out of Iraq</a> not because Basra is calm enough to be entrusted to Iraqi forces — it&rsquo;s &ldquo;not ready for transition,&rdquo; according to the <a href="https://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pdfs/9010Quarterly-Report-20061216.pdf">Pentagon&rsquo;s last report</a> — but to shift some British resources to the losing battle against the resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>This is why the entire debate about the Iraq &ldquo;surge&rdquo; is as much a sideshow as Britney&rsquo;s scalp. More troops in Baghdad are irrelevant to what&rsquo;s going down in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The surge supporters who accuse the Iraq war&rsquo;s critics of emboldening the enemy are trying to deflect attention from their own complicity in losing a bigger battle: the one against the enemy that actually did attack us on <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>. Who lost Iraq? is but a distraction from the more damning question, Who is losing the war on terrorism?</p>

<p>The record so far suggests that this White House has done so twice. The first defeat, of course, began in early December 2001, when we <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/magazine/11TORABORA.html"> lost Osama bin Laden in Tora Bora </a>. The public would not learn about that failure <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A62618-2002Apr16"> until April 2002</a> (when it was uncovered by The Washington Post), but it&rsquo;s revealing that the administration started its bait-and-switch trick to relocate the enemy in Iraq just as bin Laden slipped away. It was on Dec. 9, 2001, that Dick Cheney first floated the idea on &ldquo;Meet the Press&rdquo; that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/vicepresident/news-speeches/speeches/vp20011209.html">Saddam had something to do with <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> </a>. It was &ldquo;pretty well confirmed,&rdquo; he said (though it was not), that bin Laden&rsquo;s operative Mohamed Atta had met with an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague months before Atta flew a hijacked plane into the World Trade Center.</p>

<p>In the Scooter Libby trial, Mr. Cheney&rsquo;s former communications aide, Catherine Martin, said that delivering a message on &ldquo;Meet the Press&rdquo; was &ldquo;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012501951.html"> a tactic we often used</a>.&rdquo; No kidding. That mention of the nonexistent Prague meeting was the first of five times that the vice president would imply an Iraq-Qaeda collaboration on that NBC show before the war began in March 2003. This bogus innuendo was an essential tool for selling the war precisely because we had lost bin Laden in Afghanistan. If we could fight Al Qaeda by going to war in Iraq instead, the administration could claim it didn&rsquo;t matter where bin Laden was. (Mr. Bush pointedly stopped mentioning him altogether in public.)</p>

<p>The president now says his government <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/08/20060821.html">never hyped any <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>-Iraq links</a>. &ldquo;Nobody has ever suggested that the attacks of September the 11th were ordered by Iraq,&rdquo; he said last August after finally conceding that Iraq had nothing to do with <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>. In fact everyone in the administration insinuated it constantly, including him. Mr. Bush told of &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; Iraq-Qaeda contacts &ldquo;that go back a decade&rdquo; in the same <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021007-8.html">notorious October 2002 speech</a> that gave us Saddam&rsquo;s imminent mushroom clouds. So effective was this propaganda that by 2003 some <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0314/p02s01-woiq.html">44 percent of Americans</a> believed (incorrectly) that the <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> hijackers had been Iraqis; only 3 percent had seen an Iraq link right after <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>.</p>

<p>Though the nonexistent connection was even more specious than the nonexistent nuclear W.M.D., Mr. Bush still leans on it today even while denying that he does so. He has to. His litanies that we are &ldquo;on the offense&rdquo; by pursuing the war in Iraq and &ldquo;fighting terrorists over there, so that we don&rsquo;t have to fight them here&rdquo; depend on the premise that we went into that country in the first place to vanquish Al Qaeda and that it is still the &ldquo;central front&rdquo; in the war on terror. In January&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070123-2.html">State of the Union address</a> hawking the so-called surge, Mr. Bush did it again, warning that to leave Iraq &ldquo;would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and invite tragedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But now more than ever, the opposite is true. It is precisely by pouring still more of our finite military and intelligence resources down the drain in Iraq that we are tragically ignoring the lessons of <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>. Instead of showing resolve, as Mr. Bush supposes, his botch of the Iraq war has revealed American weakness. Our catastrophic occupation spawned terrorists in a country where they didn&rsquo;t used to be, and to pretend that Iraq is now their central front only adds to the disaster. As Mr. Scheuer, the former C.I.A. official, reiterated last week: &ldquo;Al Qaeda is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. If you want to address the threat to America, that&rsquo;s where it is.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s typical of Mr. Bush&rsquo;s self-righteousness, however, that he would rather punt on that threat than own up to a mistake.</p>

<p>That mistake — dropping the ball on Al Qaeda — was compounded last fall when Mr. Bush committed his second major blunder in the war on terror. The occasion was the September revelation that our supposed ally, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, had <a href="https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F20B13FA3D550C758CDDA00894DE404482">negotiated a &ldquo;truce&rdquo; with the Taliban</a> in North Waziristan, a tribal region in his country at the Afghanistan border. This truce was actually a retreat by Pakistan, which even released Qaeda prisoners in its custody. Yet the Bush White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/09/20060922.html"> denied any of this was happening</a>. &ldquo;This deal is not at all with the Taliban,&rdquo; the president said, claiming that &ldquo;this is against the Taliban, actually.&rdquo; When Dana Priest and Ann Scott Tyson of The Washington Post reported that same month that the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/09/AR2006090901105.html">bin Laden trail was &ldquo;stone cold</a>&rdquo; and had been since Mr. Bush diverted special operations troops from that hunt to Iraq in 2003, the White House branded the story <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/09/20060910-1.html">flat wrong</a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the hunt,&rdquo; <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0609/20/sitroom.01.html">  Mr. Bush said </a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Far from getting him or any of his top operatives dead or alive, the president has sat idly by, showering praise on General Musharraf while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/16/world/asia/16cnd-gates.html">  Taliban attacks from Pakistan into Afghanistan have increased threefold </a>. As The Times reported last week, now both bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, are believed to be &ldquo;steadily building an operations hub&rdquo; in North Waziristan. We know that last year&rsquo;s London plot to bomb airliners, like the bus-and-subway bombings of 2005, was not just the work of home-grown jihadists in Britain, but also of Qaeda operatives. Some of the would-be bombers were trained in Qaeda&rsquo;s Pakistan camps much as their <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> predecessors had been trained in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>All of this was already going on when Mr. Bush said just before the election that &ldquo;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/10/20061025.html">  absolutely, we&rsquo;re winning</a>&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Al Qaeda is on the run.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s changed in the few months since his lie is that even more American troops are tied down in Iraq, that even more lethal weapons are being used against them, that even more of the coalition of the unwilling are fleeing, and that even more Americans are tuning out both the administration and the war they voted down in November to savor a referendum that at least offers tangible results, &ldquo;American Idol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Bush still denies reality. Ten days ago <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/02/20070215-1.html">he told the American Enterprise Institute </a> that &ldquo;the Taliban have been driven from power&rdquo; and proposed that America help stabilize the Pakistan border by setting up &ldquo;Reconstruction Opportunity Zones&rdquo; (remember that &ldquo; <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/09/20050915-8.html">  Gulf Opportunity Zone</a>&rdquo; he promised after Katrina?) to &ldquo;give residents the chance to export locally made products to the United States, duty-free.&rdquo; In other words, let&rsquo;s fight terrorism not by shifting America&rsquo;s focus from Iraq to the central front, but by shopping for Taliban souvenirs!</p>

<p>Five years after <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>, the terrorists would seem to have us just where they want us — asleep — even as the system is blinking red once again.</p>

<p><strong>Letter from Carolyn Ho – mother of Lt Watada</strong></p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>On behalf of Lt. Watada and our family, thank you for standing with us during this most difficult time. Because of his refusal to deploy to the illegal and immoral Iraq War, my son now faces a maximum of 6 years in a military prison. The pretrial is scheduled for Jan. 4, 2007.  The court martial is calendared for Feb. 5, 2007.</p>

<p>We are just days away from the pretrial and must broaden his support base. Help us mobilize the local, national, and international community through your personal, professional, religious and other networks. Please forward the attached email alert with a brief explanation. Ask people to go to: <a href="https://www.thankyoult.org/">www.thankyoult.org</a> to learn more about Lt. Watada&rsquo;s case. On the main menu, supporters can click on SIGN PETITION/GET UPDATES AND ALERTS.  They will receive weekly email updates that call for actions in support of  Lt. Watada&rsquo;s stand.</p>

<p>Encourage your contacts to integrate these actions into the anti-war activism they are already doing.  Their voices are critical to building an international public opinion campaign that demands justice and no punishment for Lt. Watada.  His voice of resistance to this heinous war cannot be silenced!</p>

<p>In Solidarity,</p>

<p>Carolyn Ho (Lt. Watada&rsquo;s Mother)</p>

<p>****<strong>Make your 2007 New Year&rsquo;s Resolution to Stand with Lt. Watada Against Illegal and Immoral War</strong></p>

<p>On Monday, February 5, 2007 take action against the Iraq war and in support of Lt. Watada during his military court martial.  Stand up with Lt. Watada and speak out against the illegal and immoral war!******  Join the national movement and organize student walkouts and non-violent demonstrations.  Together let&rsquo;s build a mass movement in the streets, in our schools, and in our communities to end the Iraq War.**  On Feb. 5, 2007 rally at the gates of Fort Lewis, Washington or in your local community.</p>

<p>For courageously standing up and speaking out against the Iraq War, New Year&rsquo;s Eve 2007 may be Lt. Watada&rsquo;s last holiday as a free man until 2013.  While many 28 year-olds are starting their families and building their careers, Ehren will be locked away in military prison for following his conscience and refusing to fight in the Iraq War.</p>

<p>****<strong>Now it is time for you to follow your conscience and join the national movement to support Lt. Watada and end the Iraq war.</strong></p>

<p>As civilians, the responsibility ultimately falls on us to demand an end to the Iraq war.  In fact, we owe it to the soldiers who are fighting and dying in Iraq every day, as well as those resisting the war. We must all stand up and speak out against the war and in support Lt. Ehren Watada!</p>

<p>Currently, the Bush Administration is planning to deploy 30,000 more U.S. troops to Iraq, yet the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose the Iraq war. Since 2003 the war has cost 3,000 U.S. soldiers&rsquo; lives, approximately 950,000 Iraqi deaths, 2 trillion U.S tax dollars or approximately 8 billion dollars a week. We can no longer stand by and continue to allow this great injustice to occur!</p>

<p>__<em>&ldquo;My fellow soldiers are fighting and dying in Iraq and their families are suffering because of the lies and deceptions crafted by the Bush Administration.  The Iraq war is not only a crime against domestic and international law but [it] is a terrible moral injustice against the Iraqi people.&rdquo;  Lt. Ehren Watada</em></p>

<p>As the first Army officer to publicly speak out against the war and refuse deployment to Iraq, Lt Watada will be punished by the U.S. Army with a maximum six years in prison.****** The military&rsquo;s intention IS to SILENCE VOICES OF RESISTANCE and make an example out of Lt. Watada.**</p>

<p>Lt. Watada&rsquo;s bold actions have raised the consciousness of thousands of Americans about the illegality and immorality of this war, but his actions alone will not stop the Iraq war.  If Lt. Watada is willing to sacrifice his freedom, then we, too, must voice our opposition and take action to end the war.</p>

<p>****<strong>Take Action Feb. 5, 2007 during Lt. Watada&rsquo;s military court martial and make your 2007 New Year&rsquo;s Resolution to Stand with Lt. Watada Against Illegal and Immoral War.</strong></p>

<h3 id="pirates-of-the-mediterranean">Pirates of the Mediterranean</h3>

<p>By ROBERT HARRIS</p>

<p>Kintbury, EnglandIN the autumn of 68 B.C. the world&rsquo;s only military superpower was dealt a profound psychological blow by a daring terrorist attack on its very heart. Rome&rsquo;s port at Ostia was set on fire, the consular war fleet destroyed, and two prominent senators, together with their bodyguards and staff, kidnapped.The incident, dramatic though it was, has not attracted much attention from modern historians. But history is mutable. An event that was merely a footnote five years ago has now, in our post-<sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> world, assumed a fresh and ominous significance. For in the panicky aftermath of the attack, the Roman people made decisions that set them on the path to the destruction of their Constitution, their democracy and their liberty. One cannot help wondering if history is repeating itself.</p>

<p>Consider the parallels. The perpetrators of this spectacular assault were not in the pay of any foreign power: no nation would have dared to attack Rome so provocatively. They were, rather, the disaffected of the earth: &ldquo;The ruined men of all nations,&rdquo; in the words of the great 19th-century German historian Theodor Mommsen, &ldquo;a piratical state with a peculiar esprit de corps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like Al Qaeda, these pirates were loosely organized, but able to spread a disproportionate amount of fear among citizens who had believed themselves immune from attack. To quote Mommsen again: &ldquo;The Latin husbandman, the traveler on the Appian highway, the genteel bathing visitor at the terrestrial paradise of Baiae were no longer secure of their property or their life for a single moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What was to be done? Over the preceding centuries, the Constitution of ancient Rome had developed an intricate series of checks and balances intended to prevent the concentration of power in the hands of a single individual. The consulship, elected annually, was jointly held by two men. Military commands were of limited duration and subject to regular renewal. Ordinary citizens were accustomed to a remarkable degree of liberty: the cry of &ldquo;Civis Romanus sum&rdquo; — &ldquo;I am a Roman citizen&rdquo; — was a guarantee of safety throughout the world.</p>

<p>But such was the panic that ensued after Ostia that the people were willing to compromise these rights. The greatest soldier in Rome, the 38-year-old Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (better known to posterity as Pompey the Great) arranged for a lieutenant of his, the tribune Aulus Gabinius, to rise in the Roman Forum and propose an astonishing new law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pompey was to be given not only the supreme naval command but what amounted in fact to an absolute authority and uncontrolled power over everyone,&rdquo; the Greek historian Plutarch wrote. &ldquo;There were not many places in the Roman world that were not included within these limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pompey eventually received almost the entire contents of the Roman Treasury — 144 million sesterces — to pay for his &ldquo;war on terror,&rdquo; which included building a fleet of 500 ships and raising an army of 120,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry. Such an accumulation of power was unprecedented, and there was literally a riot in the Senate when the bill was debated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at a tumultuous mass meeting in the center of Rome, Pompey&rsquo;s opponents were cowed into submission, the Lex Gabinia passed (illegally), and he was given his power. In the end, once he put to sea, it took less than three months to sweep the pirates from the entire Mediterranean. Even allowing for Pompey&rsquo;s genius as a military strategist, the suspicion arises that if the pirates could be defeated so swiftly, they could hardly have been such a grievous threat in the first place.</p>

<p>But it was too late to raise such questions. By the oldest trick in the political book — the whipping up of a panic, in which any dissenting voice could be dismissed as &ldquo;soft&rdquo; or even &ldquo;traitorous&rdquo; — powers had been ceded by the people that would never be returned. Pompey stayed in the Middle East for six years, establishing puppet regimes throughout the region, and turning himself into the richest man in the empire.</p>

<p>Those of us who are not Americans can only look on in wonder at the similar ease with which the ancient rights and liberties of the individual are being surrendered in the United States in the wake of <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>. The vote by the Senate on Thursday to suspend the right of habeas corpus for terrorism detainees, denying them their right to challenge their detention in court; the careful wording about torture, which forbids only the inducement of &ldquo;serious&rdquo; physical and mental suffering to obtain information; the admissibility of evidence obtained in the United States without a search warrant; the licensing of the president to declare a legal resident of the United States an enemy combatant — all this represents an historic shift in the balance of power between the citizen and the executive.</p>

<p>An intelligent, skeptical American would no doubt scoff at the thought that what has happened since <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> could presage the destruction of a centuries-old constitution; but then, I suppose, an intelligent, skeptical Roman in 68 B.C. might well have done the same.</p>

<p>In truth, however, the Lex Gabinia was the beginning of the end of the Roman republic. It set a precedent. Less than a decade later, Julius Caesar — the only man, according to Plutarch, who spoke out in favor of Pompey&rsquo;s special command during the Senate debate — was awarded similar, extended military sovereignty in Gaul. Previously, the state, through the Senate, largely had direction of its armed forces; now the armed forces began to assume direction of the state.</p>

<p>It also brought a flood of money into an electoral system that had been designed for a simpler, non-imperial era. Caesar, like Pompey, with all the resources of Gaul at his disposal, became immensely wealthy, and used his treasure to fund his own political faction. Henceforth, the result of elections was determined largely by which candidate had the most money to bribe the electorate. In 49 B.C., the system collapsed completely, Caesar crossed the Rubicon — and the rest, as they say, is ancient history.</p>

<p>It may be that the Roman republic was doomed in any case. But the disproportionate reaction to the raid on Ostia unquestionably hastened the process, weakening the restraints on military adventurism and corrupting the political process. It was to be more than 1,800 years before anything remotely comparable to Rome&rsquo;s democracy — imperfect though it was — rose again.</p>

<p>The Lex Gabinia was a classic illustration of the law of unintended consequences: it fatally subverted the institution it was supposed to protect. Let us hope that vote in the United States Senate does not have the same result.</p>

                        <p>##13:45 Sunday 27 August 2006</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2006/EDUCATION/08/06/sept11.theories.ap/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2006/EDUCATION/08/06/sept11.theories.ap/index.html</a></p>

<p>I do not buy that 911 was an inside job by the government.  I can buy that the Neocons in the Bush admin potentially knew something was up and did nothing in order to create public sentiment that would rally behind the flag and agree to their extreme foriegn policy agenda, but that&rsquo;s a far cry from orchestrating the event and attacking your own nation with missiles, etc.  I don&rsquo;t believe that this happened, but I see the motivation that they may have had.</p>

<p>I heard James Fetzer, the co-founder of the Scholars for <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub> Truth on a radio interview.  The guy claimed that some of the hijackers are still alive and living in Europe.  He claimed that the BBc had interviewed them on TV.  The radio host (of a liberal talk show) felt obligate dto follow-up on that point and googled for signs of this and could not find one orginal article on the BBC website.  So then he wanted to make sure that he tried hard enough to research the claim, and he called the BBC and tried to find a producer over there that knew anything about this.  The BBC producers laughed at him and hung up on him.</p>

<p>Furthermore, from listening to this guy, I truly believe that these people are just letting their emotion get the best of them.  This Fetzer guy claimed that he has experts that say that as few as 10 trips to the WTC could hav ebeen made prior to 911 to strategically place explosives, and because its such a small number of trips, that we should believe that no one saw anyone preparing the building for demolition.  I heard this and thought it was outrageous on its face.  If yo&rsquo;ve ever watched a documentary on demolitions of this type, they have to drill into the structural supports of the building with giant hammer-drills that pound away at the concrete like a jack-hammer while they are drilling.  On top of that, even if they only made 10 trips, as he says, they&rsquo;d have to carry at least a couple huge packages of explosives into the building.  So my question is &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think that *<strong>anyone</strong> who worked in the WTC would have seen a guy walking around with a dufflebag full of explosives and a giant hammer-drill?  &hellip;and these guys would not have been simply walking down the stairwells.  from what i understand about these buildings, the main structural supports were (1) the center shaft of the building that housed the elevators/electrical/plumbing, and (2) the outter skin of the building.  How could someone access these parts of the building, drill into cement with a hammer-drill, place a whole bunch of explosives at key points, and still not have anyone notice???!!!???  Its simple common sense to me.  It just could not have happened.</p>

<p>Secondly, and much more damming to their assertion, is the fact that no one from within the conspiracy has come forward.  Something like a dozen people have left the Bush administration on bad terms and many have written tell-all books that the administration has been furious about.  The list is long and distinguished:  Colin Powell, Christie Whitman, Richard Clarke, Paul O&rsquo;Neil, Thomas White, Eric Shenseki, Lawrence Wilkerson.  &hellip;and all these people were let go for telling the truth.   &hellip;and many of them have said on the record that the Bush administration wante dto go to war with Iraq from day one.  If 911 was an inside job, why wouldn&rsquo;t any of these people, who already have been fire for telling the truth, come forward and spill the beans?  But what&rsquo;s even a more obvious question is: a plan like this would have to be comprised of at least dozens of people and potentially hundreds of people; why has not one person surfaced and said &ldquo;I know the whole story and it was an inside job&rdquo;.  You simply cannot keep a secret like this.  Its impossible.  For crying out loud, people leak less important stuff nearly everyday.  Surely, there would be a leaker if this were true.  But there isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, but there is simply no evidence that 911 was an inside job and I am getting tired of explaining this to people.  I hate what Bush has done to the country more than anyone and I&rsquo;d love to get him out of office, and I think he deserves to go to jail for some of the things he&rsquo;s done, so I am not some salute-the-president happy republican here.  I think that two things contribute to people&rsquo;s willingness to buy these conspiracy theories (1) peoples&rsquo; hatred for Bush, and (2) people&rsquo;s understandable feeling that they don&rsquo;t want to believe that a few simpletons with box cutters could take down an American icon.  These two factors cloud people&rsquo;s ability to see things objectively.</p>

<p>Lastly, I am not saying that there are not unanswered questions.  I think that the 911 commission was way too easy on alot of people.  The mere fact that the president got a brief titled &ldquo;Bin Laden Determined to Attack USA&rdquo; on 08/06/2001 is evidence that these clowns were goofing around in the white house when they should have been protecting America.  At least when Clinton was getting head in the oval office, no one attacked the country.  Bush took a 6 week vacation right before both Katrina and 911!!!</p>

<p>That is from a thread between me, Dude and my brother after the announcement that we can&rsquo;t bring drinks onto planes anymore:</p>

<p>From: American Embassy Tokyo
Date: Aug 11, 2006 10:57 AM
Subject: Public Announcement</p>

<p><snip></p>

<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is implementing a series of security measures, some visible and some not visible, to ensure the security of the traveling public and the nation&rsquo;s transportation system.</p>

<p>NO LIQUIDS OR GELS OF ANY KIND WILL BE PERMITTED IN CARRY-ON BAGGAGE. SUCH ITEMS MUST BE IN CHECKED BAGGAGE.</p>

<p>This includes all beverages, shampoo, suntan lotion, creams, tooth paste, hair gel, and other items of similar consistency</p>

<p>Exceptions: Baby formula and breast milk if a baby or small child is traveling and medicines, which must be presented for inspection at the checkpoint.</p>

<p>From: Dude</p>

<p>what&rsquo;s crazy is that they are still allowing each person to carry two books of matches!!!  I really do not get this.  You cannot smoke on planes and in most airports.  Smoking is not vital to national security, and its a horrible public health problem.  oh yeah&hellip;.  the tobacco lobby gives alot of money to politicians.  Now I get it.</p>

<hr />

<p>From: Rob</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s infuriating!   _(ed. note: I am a genius!)</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">_</h2>

<p>From: Fred</p>

<p>the whole thing is a pile of shit.  chertoff is a complete idiot.  he is fourth on my list of people to hate after karl rove, dick cheney, and donald rumsfeld.  oh, and speaking of karl rove, i want to kick robert novak in the nuts for protecting him, and then patrick fitzgerald for giving rove immunity.  whatever company novak works for, i am never giving them money ever.</p>

<p>but back to air travel.  i mean, the system <em>worked</em>!  the bad guys got caught!  the us/uk cops could have intervened weeks ago, but they decided to wait until the shit was going down before arresting anybody, and now look at what&rsquo;s happened: water is the new terrorist threat.</p>

<p>recall that idiot who tried to light his shoes on fire.  everyone now knows the score: the civilized hijackings of the seventies are over. if guy says he has a bomb, you&rsquo;re all going to die anyway&ndash;bum rush him.  problem solved, just like on united 93.  no need for extra security, we can take care of things ourselves.  but what&rsquo;s happened? we still have to take off our shoes or get the wand, even years later! it&rsquo;s completely stupid, and it&rsquo;s a health risk.</p>

<p>people, people.  it&rsquo;s a fucking <em>bus</em>.  get on, sit down, and shut up.
there is no magic any more.  it is not a luxury cruise.  you cannot be &ldquo;secure.&rdquo;  you fly a plane cause it&rsquo;s <em>faster</em>, not because it&rsquo;s cheaper or safer.</p>

<p>i am writing a letter to my congressman telling him that he&rsquo;d better get it in gear or i&rsquo;m not voting for him.  no incumbents.  fuck you guys.</p>

<hr />

<p>From: Dude</p>

<p>amen!!!  I totally agree that any MF who tried anything on a plane would get bum-rushed and killed by passengers.  I know I&rsquo;d be one of the people kicking the guy&rsquo;s ass.
