<p class=date>12:09am CDT Sunday 7 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Gladiators was pretty cool story, but pretty gory.  I didn&rsquo;t watch
all the scenes.  Dudes fighting each other to the death is not my
favorite thing to watch.</p>

<p><p>The characters were well developed and the good guy won in the end.</p>

<p><p>How&rsquo;s that for a short synopsis of a 2.5 hour movie?</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>After the movie, we munched at Star Pizza, where Molly relayed lots
of stories of Rome and how they beat Carthage in naval battles and
salted the earth and became corrupted and how the Roman Empire
basically fractured and imploded.  Cool stories.  How does Molly know
all this?</p>

<p><p>Olivia, our waitress, was cute and amazed when I finished my 30
ounce glass of water after she brought it and before she left the
table.  &ldquo;You did not just finish this,&rdquo; her eyes wide.   &ldquo;Yup.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I drank 3.5 * 30 ounces, or 105 ounces of water during dinner, and
had lots of salad and even a couple slices of pizza.</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>After Star Pizza, we walked across the street to Amy&rsquo;s Ice Cream.
I got vanilla oatmeal raisin ice cream and plain M&amp;Ms.  Very nice.</p>

<p><p>(I am so tired)</p>

<p><p>We sat outside and ate outside, laughing and joking about everything.</p>

<p><p>After Amy&rsquo;s they brought me home and hung out a bit for Wende to arrive.  Yay!!</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh the best thing!!!!!!!  They got me a cool clip-on watch - similar to a pocket watch, but it&rsquo;s digital, and it clips onto a beltloop.</p>

<p><p>And some lovely microwave designed plastic bowls that vent automagically.</p>

<p class=date>4:12pm CST Sunday 27 February 2000</p></p>

<p><p><em>The Whole Nine Yards</em> is great!!  I have a new
movie-actress-girlfriend, Amanda Peet.. She&rsquo;s so cute!!!  It&rsquo;s a great
comedy with great lines and visual entertainment.  (Now I can see why
I&rsquo;m not a movie critic..)  Go see the film.  Good funny stuff!</p>

<p><p>Julie, Wende&rsquo;s sister is here, being somewhat bored.  I asked if
she wants to be quoted in my journal.  She says, &ldquo;nope.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wende&rsquo;s candles turned out well; they are cooled now.  The wax
shrank as it cooled, making the tops of the candles fairly deeply
concave.  The one in which I put ice has little caverns at the bottom.
I don&rsquo;t know where the water went..  seems to me it would be trapped
in the bottom.</p>

<p><p>Ah.  There is.  I just couldn&rsquo;t see it at first because no air
bubbles were present in the water!  Makes sense.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Tonight: Benihana with Wende, Julie, their mom and step-dad,
Maggie, Molly, John, Will, Eric and Merideth!</p>

<p><p>A line from Beastie Boys song &ldquo;Puttin&rsquo; Shame in Your Game&rdquo; off
<em>Hello Nasty</em> keeps going through my head:</p>

<p><p><pre>I&rsquo;m the Benihana chef on the SP12
I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
You be like hello nasty where you been
It&rsquo;s time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon
</pre></p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s my favorite song on the album.</p>

<p><p>Oh!!!  When Wende and I first started dating like back in late
1996, she bought me a &ldquo;build your own paper clock&rdquo; for Christmas.  I
worked on it for several days then - got about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of it finished.  I
put it up in my closet when I got stuck on one piece that I glued
barely wrong and never got it back out&hellip; until today.</p>

<p><p>The coolest thing about it, besides that it seems to be perfectly
preserved; I put dates on nearly all the pieces, indicating when I put
them together.  I can practically reconstruct (no pun intended) how
the project progressed.  And, of course, when my grandkids see it:
mystery .. <em>wow - he forgot about it for 3 years</em></p>

<p><p>Course, I&rsquo;d have to have kids first.</p>

<p>Wende and I watched <em>Blast From The Past</em> last night.  It was great!</p>

<p>I was actually pretty surprised at how well I liked it.  I thought it
would just be a cheesy romance thing, but I was laughing at the
situations and all the wacky funny stuff!</p>

<p>Given the plot, the resulting situations were believable (assuming
they could in fact survive 35 years in a large hole) and quite
entertaining.  Good ending and all that.</p>

<p>The funniest scene to me: he was outside skating, and some beautiful
women skated by and smiled hugely at him.  His eyes kinda went gaga,
but it turns out, not at the skaters!</p>

<p>Go check it out!</p>

                        <p><title>The Seige</title></p>

<p class=date>8 November 1998</p>

<p>After church today, on a total whim, Wende and I saw <em>The Seige</em>, starring Denzel Washington, Annette Benning, Bruce Willis, and some other guy whose name I cannot remember.

<p>The whole idea that <em>that</em> could happen was really scary to me. Seeing Brooklyn under martial law made me think damn I am glad to be free. Emotion and tears ripped through me to see the concetration camp that was created. It was nuts.

<p>Denzel's character was tough and believable, although his face seemed to heal quite quickly after one particular incident.

<p>Bruce Willis played the super patriotic, testosterone driven general and it was the first role I'd seen him in where I thought, "grrrr" at his character.

<p>The scene that is shown in the previews with Bruce yelling at Denzel, "<b>RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, I <em>AM</em> THE LAW!!!</b>" 
put me in a death-grip on Wende's hand.

<p>'twas a good movie. I'm glad it was only a movie.

<p>Or was it??</p>

<p>(after riots and militarized police in Ferguson, Missouri)</p>
