<p>Watching Stand Up Guys now based on it being a comedy and having
Christopher Walken in it.  Al Pacino is a bonus; I don&rsquo;t know the
third guy.  They&rsquo;re driving some gangsters&rsquo; car now, being chased by
the police.</p>

<p>Good movie!  Not Pulp Fiction, but still funny, though a little bit
blah ending.  I wanted happily ever after.</p>

<p>Now You See Me caught my eye on Netflix and I quite enjoyed it.  There
were a couple of minor <em>yeah right</em> points (besides all of them), but
generally it&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>Inside Out is the latest Pixar film I&rsquo;ve seen.  It hilariously and
perfectly describes how emotions seem to work in our minds.  Emotions
in balance lead to a normal life, while unchecked emotion of any
persuasion can lead to a bit of a disaster.  I love how it answers so
many unasked questions!  &ldquo;Ohhh! This explains why that happens!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyway, go see it.  I hope to see it with Lin sometime.  It&rsquo;s actually
a reasonably good introduction into the idea of emotional growth.</p>

<p>We watched <em>Starting Over</em> at Jon and Paola&rsquo;s.  It&rsquo;s a comedy romance,
but pretty good, though JP were like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not going to win any
Oscars..&rdquo; I liked the student; he reminded me of Ferris Bueller,
though I barely remember that movie.</p>

<p>I just saw (the original) Psycho for the first time.  I thought it was
quite slow at first, but it started getting interesting after the
second murder.  The long winded explanation at the end was a bit too
much.  I wonder what has changed to give me less of a tolerance for
such explanation as movie goers when the movie was first made.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to see this movie ever since I was a little kid when it
first came out.  Tonight, we are watching it on Hulu.  (and by
watching, I mean I&rsquo;m watching, and Lin&rsquo;s taking a shower.  She&rsquo;ll
sleep on the couch soon after she gets back.)</p>

<p>##2:30</p>

<p>Well, it wasn&rsquo;t terrible, but it was definitely dated.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.jinni.com/movies/the-thing/reviews/">review on Jinni</a>
said</p>

<pre><code>It is certainly not boring, but it doesn't seem to add up to
much. Besides a few personality quirks, the characters are not
very clearly delineated, making it somewhat arbitrary who survives
in the end and difficult for us to even care.
</code></pre>

<p>Yup.</p>

<p>Spoilers ahead!!</p>

<p>Due to the Streisand Effect, I&rsquo;m watching The Interview.  It&rsquo;s got
some funny parts, and some racist parts.. but isn&rsquo;t all that thought
provoking.</p>

<p>Spoilers next!!</p>

<p>##20:09</p>

<p>Just finished the movie.  I was optimistic that they wouldn&rsquo;t kill
KJU, but they did.  The character played by
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3048983/?ref_=tt_cl_t5">Diana Bang</a> was
great+funny+hot!</p>

<p>Some of the humor was childish; some of the violence was overdone;
KJU&rsquo;s death was quite graphic.</p>

<p>I hoped they would just leave it at him crying, not going crazy, and
not being killed.  Bah.</p>

<p>I cried twice during Interstellar.</p>

<p>I was planning to cry a third time, but the movie ended too soon!</p>

<p>Overall, I wasn&rsquo;t put off by the physics.  Using gravity to move the
second hand on the watch (but not the rest of the watch) was lame, but
bearable if I replace the word &ldquo;gravity&rdquo; with &ldquo;finger coming through
5th dimension&rdquo;.  The emotional parts of the movie were pretty great,
though I was sad to see Matt Damon play a &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing the time dialation stuff in action was trippy, and well done.</p>

<p><p>Last night Wende and I saw Mission: Impossible 2.  It was pretty
stuntful, but the plot was not astonishing, and some of the stunts did
not properly conserve physical momentum.</p>

<p><p>But too be sure, the stunts were really awesome. A couple of times
I could see the background on &ldquo;screen&rdquo; behind the actor, but not too
often, and I didn&rsquo;t let that ruin my movie experience.</p>

<p><p>My favorite scene was remniscent of Silence of the Lambs, but Wende
said she predicted it before the scene started.</p>

<p><p>Good movie for the stunts, but I give it a 1.25 thumbs up.</p>

<p><p>Here&rsquo;s a weird thing: I was offended by the sex scenes, which were
<em>not</em> that steamy, but just seemed so degrading toward women. (or to
the woman in the scene)..  I&rsquo;ve been reading a book called <em>Goddess
Sexuality</em> (or something like that) and I recognize how much our
society&rsquo;s patriarchy is smeared through everything.  There was no
other woman in the movie (not counting extras)..  It was all multi
zillion dollar businessmen, all grappling for money and power and the
holy grail, and using the girl as bait and a pawn.  There were some
