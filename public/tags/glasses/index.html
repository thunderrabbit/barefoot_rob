<p>For some reason, Fred and I called glasses goggles back when we were
kids.</p>

<p>He emailed me:</p>

<pre><code>u wanna do some minecraft? 
i'm free all the time except 10am-7pm,
dec 26-29.
</code></pre>

<p>My email to him follows:</p>

<pre><code>Yep sounds good

I will be on vacation during that time.

I lost my goggles though so I haaveto ware contacts, until I get
back to Japan and Japan gets back to work after the New Year.

Thankfully I was able to get contacts here in Brazil Fortaleza on
the night before we left for the next city which has fewer
unnaturaal resources (but far more naturaly resources)

Iam a bit sad to lose my glasses, but bah fuckit it will be
temporary until I get new ones back.

Plus we are on vacation so I dont have to do anything really.


bUTT  I want to keep working on my program.

I got to the point that I need to start making the library.  Well
almost at that point now.  I tried to output as HTML but it did
not seem to work when I loaded it on my site at
new.robnugen.com/samples/godot/v0.0.9. something I tink
/samples/godot will get you close enough but anyway the shit does
not load.  One of the files is 200MB which is like wut

Anyway, I can swipe pieces

oh heay you can run it in Godot if you download from
godotengine.org??  I will have to look for my repo (I have been
typing this entire email with my eyes closed, and no plans to
spellcheck shit, but I will epen open my eyyeyes to get the repo
for you.

github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi I think.

https://github.com/thunderrabbit/robdot_conswi

Yeah so that is the one and only correctly spelled thing in this
email.  Um, so last night and this morning I got swipes to
highlihgt and then to remove the colors.  Then this afternoon I
had a brainstorm that allowed the pieces above the removed pieces
to fall down into place perfectly.  So happy that it worked!

Now I am in the middle of adding a queue of upcoming pieces and
then will add the Shape Library thing.

but first bedtime.  THe good nws.  actually giving your
availability it might be bad news, but curious news is that we are
in siilar timezones.  We are in -3 whereas you are in -6 We might
move up an hour after our flight tomorrow but I will not know that
until tomorrow.

okay enough blind rambling for now.

pieaces out

<p>At the bottom of the hill from our new house there&rsquo;s a glasses shop,
so I&rsquo;m getting glasses there now.  Actually just lense.s  The guy did
a test and was like, yeah your current lenses are perfect.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m keeping my existing glasses frame as well.</p>
