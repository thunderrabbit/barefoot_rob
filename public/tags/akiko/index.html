                        <p>Hide and Akiko from 7pm class each needed to make up some lessons, so
stayed for the 8pm class featuring Misato and Tatsuya.</p>

<p>I think it worked pretty well; they had not met each other, and they
are all pretty much similar personalities so I figured they would get
along fine.</p>

<p>After self intros, most of the time they talked about Akiko&rsquo;s challenging business trip
to Hydrabad, India.  Most of the rest of the time we talked about Hide&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>Akiko and I went to CoCo&rsquo;s for our language exchange today and she
helped me figure out how the EOS tea business works.</p>

<p>We each ordered drink bar for around 400 yen.  As thanks for her
business support today, I paid for hers.</p>

<p>Akiko and I went to her train line&rsquo;s side of Akihabara, and ate at the
Indian restaurant on the 9th floor of the BIC Camera building.
Bottomless cheese nan seems like a good deal until I eat the second
one!</p>

<p>We talked about her upcoming trip overseas and pets and other stuff I
am too tired to remember, much less write.  Oh, we also talked about
commas and when to use them.  Tough question!</p>

<p>Her Japanese teacher told her to add 、 when she wanted to say ね.
That&rsquo;s as good as most rules I&rsquo;ve heard for commas in English.</p>

<p>These are notes she wrote in the last three lessons.</p>

<p>Today was the second time for Akiko and I to do a language exchange.
She had some good ideas for
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com">Marble Track 3</a> and how to market it.
I may end up creating another Instagram account; that is apparently
the way to go these days.</p>

<p>So happy to get another subscriber on Youtube, and enthralling to see
her enthralled with the process of animating the construction!</p>

<p>For example, when she watched how I made the part with Spoonhead and
Candy Mama lifting and sending small orange marbles down the Triple
Splitter Small Feeder, she realized that the marbles have to be placed
in exactly  spots in order to appear to be rolling.  She also asked
the very important question: do marbles really roll down the track?</p>

<p>Great question, and yes.</p>

<p>Wow so great to be back in touch with Akiko!</p>

<p>I met her in EV back back in the day, and lost touch after I quit
working there and got busy etc etc, but today in the middle of getting
to Inbox Zero (I am cleaned out back to 2012 I think), I wrote to her
and she wrote back!</p>

<p>AND she says she is interested in teaching me Japanese, which I
believe I am more interested now than I was then.</p>

<p>AND AND she lives close to us!</p>
