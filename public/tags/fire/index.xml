Yesterday Erin left for Oklahoma. I was going to go see a movie with Charmain, but she didn&#39;t get a ride. So we didn&#39;t. I was supplying the money and she was gettin&#39; a ride. I fell asleep in front of the T.V. last night. At 3AM. it went off the air. This woke me up.- Weird part: I could not feel my arms.</description>
