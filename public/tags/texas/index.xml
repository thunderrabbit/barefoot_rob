      <description>10:35 Wednesday 27 January 2016 CST Ma is driving Lin and I to county clerk&amp;rsquo;s office to register our marriage(!), which hasn&amp;rsquo;t been officially done yet!
11:10 We have our marriage form thing which we can use to be certified as married!
We went to the Travis County office because Ma knew they had pretty licenses. It works out for us because, Travis!
The deputy clerk beautifully enunciated &amp;ldquo;for all intents and purposes&amp;rdquo; when explaining that the certified copy is essentially the same as the original.</description>
