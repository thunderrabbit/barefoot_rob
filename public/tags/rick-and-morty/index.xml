      <description>00:29 Thursday 24 May 2018 JST We are nearly finished with Season 1. Tonight we watched Season 1 Episode 10 (on Netflix). I paused it a few times to make sure she was catching all the important bits and better jokes, and she understood some of them, so yay. ((( At this point, the first three seasons have been released, and I have seen all the episodes a few times each.</description>
