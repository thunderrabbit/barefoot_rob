      <description>21:53 Wednesday 16 November 2016 JST Wow.
We are happy to announce that Amazon QuickSight is now generally available in US East (Northern Virginia), US West (Oregon) and Europe (Ireland) regions! More details at https://quicksight.aws.  Check out that TLD! https://quicksight.aws
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s still cool. Did Amazon create that for themselves? I know Google did a few, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen any other companies with top level domains.

      <description>09:09 Monday 14 November 2016 JST This past weekend I learned that Amazon Photos offers unlimited storage for photos. It&amp;rsquo;s free with Amazon Prime.
Lin has Amazon Prime, so I had her account give my account Amazon Prime as well (through their family sharing thing).
But her account is on amazon.co.jp while mine is on amazon.com so I had to create a new account on amazon.co.jp. But now it seems I have Amazon Photos on both my accounts!</description>
