<p class=note>(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)</p>

<p><p>I was beaten soundly by Mr Bandecca 4 or 5 games in a row.  I kinda
felt bad, since he had commented about how he wanted a workout, not to
just piss around..  He was very nice about it, and I believe sincere
when he said he enjoyed playing.  That&rsquo;s cool.</p>

<p><p>Last night I got a call from Cheri, who said she was going out with
some guy who&rsquo;s 31, apparently a real charmer, he&rsquo;s made comments about
her nice blonde hair &amp; &ldquo;good proportions&rdquo; and commented that he&rsquo;d like
to take pictures of her.  Shit.  I told her absolutely NOT to go out
with him.  I begged her.  I told her that if she stood him up, I would
come out there &ldquo;right now&rdquo; and take her out wherever she wanted to go.
My pleading didn&rsquo;t work, so I told her at least to call me when she
got back.  She agreed to that, and she did call me back.  I was quite
glad to hear that she was OK.  I was pretty snoozy when we talked, but
I remember that she went to his apartment, but he didn&rsquo;t make any
moves on her.  I told her how much I care about her and that I was so
glad that she survived.</p>

<p><p>This morning when I got up, I noted that someone cracked my lower
right office windows.  - I guess that&rsquo;s my office&rsquo;s lower right
window.  Anyway, it looks like a rock hit it or a b-b gun.  Stupid ass
people.</p>

<p><p>Today, I did the laundry and worked on Laura&rsquo;s letter.  The written
portion of it is finished - I simply need to put in my letter inserts.
I&rsquo;m giving her several 1969 pennies, but I need to tape them to a
sheet so that they won&rsquo;t bunch up in a corner.  We have no scotch
tape, though.  I finished up her letter with the words to <em>Now</em>
by Edie Brickel &amp; New Bohemians.  Then I wrote &ldquo;that about sums it up.
I miss you.  Much Love - Rob&rdquo; I hope she likes it.  What am I
saying?!? of course she&rsquo;ll like it.  On to a new subject&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Tammy got her hair sliced while she was gone.  She got a huge make
up kit, too.  She was acting a lot like her mom when she got back.  So
far today she has spent about (1) one minute interacting with me since
we got back from the airport.  It&rsquo;s weird having her back; all her
stuff is all over the place, she&rsquo;s spent 3 hours on the computer and
about 2 on the phone.  Heh- I guess she won&rsquo;t mind if I got fuck
whoever I want.  Maybe Anne Meek from the ER at work.  Ann(e)(?) is a
tall big girl, 21 years old, big smile with braces, great eyes, long
brown hair.  Mmmm.  I will definitely interact with her once I&rsquo;m free
of Tammy.</p>

<p><p>Oh, one other cool thing.  While Tammy was gone, I kinda worked on
the Buckminster Fuller sleep schedule.  Awake 3.5 hours, sleep .5
hours over and over.  I believe that I did it once.  No great feat
really, but I had been awake a few hours, then I lay in bed &amp; dosed
for a bit (never actually fell into deep sleep) and then woke up
refreshed.  Now that I think about it, it seems like no big deal, less
than that even.  Oh well.  Sometime I will work to keep that schedule
up for a long while.  It&rsquo;s just hard to do it in today&rsquo;s society.  I
guess if I really planned it out, I could do it for a little while.
Something like&hellip;  Dude!  The pharmacy is about to close on
Saturdays.. I could do it Let me get my school schedule.  Hang on.  Ok
- I have requested that I work on Mon, Wed &amp; Fri from about 2 to 9:30.</p>

<p><p>HOLY MOLY.  That would work!  And so easily, too!  The only tough
part would be getting ready for work and napping between school on
Mon, Wed, &amp; Fri.  I would simply have to bring my work clothes to
school.  Oh my gosh - the implications of pulling this off would be
fantastic!  If I pull this off, it&rsquo;s 3 hours of sleep per day.  Just
think what I could do with all that extra time!!! Will it work?  We
shall see.  I would need to get some sort of timer that I would set.
Hmmm.  This would be great.  If necessary, I could catch up on the
weekends.  Whoah ..</p>

<p><p>This schedule does assume that I can get my &lsquo;job&rsquo; donating sperm.
I would have 20 hours per week at St. Joseph, and and extra $200 per
month from sperm donation.  More than enough to cover everything.  If
I can&rsquo;t get the sperm job, I&rsquo;ll have to get a weekend job.  We shall
see within a few weeks.  Later</p>
