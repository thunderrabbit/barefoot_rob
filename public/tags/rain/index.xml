      <description> 10:08 Sunday 24 June 2018 JST No SOGO today due to rain.
I hope Mark got the message; I met him on the train yesterday and invited him to join.
So what to do today?
Plan:
 write in Japanese work on MT3 fix https://robnugen.com/geocaching to refresh to https://new.robnugen.com/geocaching  </description>

      <description>07:50 Tuesday 09 June 2015 JST Funny how I&amp;rsquo;ve not worked on my journal infrastructure for a while. Lin just today asked why it takes me so lonngg to put the stuff back on my desk. I told her it&amp;rsquo;s cause I&amp;rsquo;m careful, but it&amp;rsquo;s also cause I&amp;rsquo;m lazy / busy with other junk.
In the case of my website, it&amp;rsquo;s only because I&amp;rsquo;m busy with other junk.
Yesterday I reinjured my elbow picking up Lin&amp;rsquo;s bicycle to carry over the train tracks on the way to meet Masa at noon in Lazona.</description>

      <description>21:56 Tuesday 12 May 2015 JST It&amp;rsquo;s raining a bit tonight. They&amp;rsquo;re calling it a &amp;ldquo;typhoon&amp;rdquo; for some reason. I&amp;rsquo;m like &amp;gt;_&amp;gt; &amp;hellip; where?
There are no garbage cans blowing across the street; no tree branches destroying houses; no power outage anywhere&amp;hellip; You call this a storm???
23:01 Okay okay so the wind blew the rain cover off my bag (twice) and destroyed my umbrella.</description>

(written 10:54 Friday 21 November 2014 JST)
Last night JB school called me, &amp;ldquo;hey can you teach tonight??&amp;rdquo; and I go &amp;ldquo;sure!&amp;rdquo; even though it was raining.
Got dressed, including a tie, rain pants, rain jacket, and even my waterproof hiking boots. Took Lin&amp;rsquo;s bicycle because its seat is waterproof.
Smart me: I had my phone earphones in my ears (that&amp;rsquo;s right, future-people, we haven&amp;rsquo;t had them permanently attached yet!</description>
