HI
I apologize for the impersonal nature of this letter; I do not know your name.
I purchased my 1991 Toyota Camry around December 1997. Since then I have had all work done on my car at Sterling McCall, until today when I got a flat tire on the north side of town.</description>

      <description>Letter to Sterling McCall
23 June 1998
Today on the way to the dentist, I hit something in the road and thought nothing of it. Soon, however, I noticed my steering seemed really far out of alignment. I was talking to Manda on my carphone at the time. &#34;Hang on one second; this is bad enough that I&#39;m going to pull over and look.&#34; I pulled over. I looked. The right front tire was entirely flat.</description>
