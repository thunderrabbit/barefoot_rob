Yesterday one of the Faisal residents showed me how to fold a simple rhombus out of a square piece of paper and then link several of these rhombi together to make various closed solids.
From my research, I have determined that it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard to put together a really big solid, but I am wondering how many rhombi are needed&amp;hellip;
I gave the geometric solids to Gyosei, who provided the paper, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have pictures of them.</description>

Starting with a rectangular carpet measuring 9 by 12 units, we need to carpet a square room 10 by 10 units and a rectangular hallway 1 by 8 units.
The carpet may be cut into exactly three (3) pieces. One piece measuring 1 by 8. The other two (2) pieces must fit together to make a square 10 by 10.
This problem was presented to us when I was in trigonometry in high school.</description>

Slashdot Math/Logic Riddles
The riddle about sorting coins without being able to see them seems impossible to me&amp;hellip; I will ponder it.</description>
