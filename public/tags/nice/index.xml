Ma and I chatted while waiting for Nico to arrive and clear customs. Fun chatting with her and nearly finished solving the latest NYT crossword puzzle. I can see how it would be a good way to keep the ol&amp;rsquo; left brain sharp.
I chatted with the nice driver of the shuttle bus as she drove us to the IAH parking lot a couple miles away from the airport.</description>

      <description>15:36 Monday 08 July 2019 JST Wow Hugo rules. Thank you, Bep!
I got my journal/ and blog/ indices separated by adding a bit of code to the pagination.
https://github.com/thunderrabbit/purehugo-tr/commit/16559a8ffa3ec74f57af7398a90f259f41972675
And now the Prev and Next links work based on section.
https://github.com/thunderrabbit/purehugo-tr/commit/97b09a88d01a493374ba6231185bf8cb9b723e0b
 &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;pager&amp;quot;&amp;gt; {{with .NextInSection}} &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;{{.Permalink}}&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;prev&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;float: left!important&amp;quot;&amp;gt;❮ {{.Title}}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;{{end}} {{with .PrevInSection}} &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;{{.Permalink}}&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;next&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;float: right!important&amp;quot;&amp;gt; {{.Title}} ❯&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;{{end}} &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;  Nice!</description>

      <description>06:34 Wednesday 08 May 2019 JST I rode TJ Bike to the bicycle parking lot today. This is the first time I have done so for work, given that we got our bicycle parking passes during Golden Week, and this is the first day that I have to work outside the house.
I usually allow 24 minutes to walk leisurely to the station. Riding TJ Bike &amp;ldquo;leisurely&amp;rdquo; down a big hill, I arrived at the bicycle parking area in 8 minutes.</description>

Christmas Day in Presidente Prudente At R&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo;s house in Presidente Prudente, Brazil, which looks to me like a house I would see in a movie. Pool in the yard overlooked by floor to ceiling glass door/walls separating indoor and outdoor living/dining areas
Super sweet talking wtih Rose last night about jacks and marbles in the street vs kids with cellphones now.
Jesse and Angelica joined us for dinner.</description>

      <description>22:40 Saturday 02 January 2016 JST I&amp;rsquo;m up to video 13 in this series https://codereviewvideos.com/course/ansible-tutorial by Chris. I&amp;rsquo;ve started a repo on bitbucket which has a few sprigs of ansible roles; I&amp;rsquo;m optimistic the repo could grow into my s00p3r-s1mpl!f13d s0lu+ion for migrating to new server when AB&amp;rsquo;s flavor of Ubuntu falls out of favor!</description>

      <description>21:20 Saturday 01 August 2015 JST Yeah, so using a couple of examples,
https://meteor.hackpad.com/Meteor-Cookbook-Reactive-D3-Visualizations-YUR9JT4mrm9
https://demos.joeondata.com/gravity_balls/
I&amp;rsquo;ve got colored balls representing bubbles in Pop Pop Chaos! I posted the latest to https://poppopshowus.meteor.com/ and here&amp;rsquo;s an archive of it as of now:
https://archive.is/rVo0W/
Next step is to get the balls moving! Thanks to Joe&amp;rsquo;s demo, I have a great chance of finishing it tonight.
1am or so Haha I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the code to work at all.</description>

      <description>16:59 Tuesday 07 July 2015 JST Nice. So I just set up Emacs on Tariq&amp;rsquo;s computer with a few clicks of the keyboard including commands like
cd ~/.emacs.d git clone git@bitbucket.org:thunderrabbit/emacs-shiz.git personal --recursive  For some reason Markdown didn&amp;rsquo;t get set, but all my other journal creation code did so that&amp;rsquo;s pretty nice.</description>
