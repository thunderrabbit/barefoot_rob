      <description>00:34 Thursday 22 March 2018 JST It snowed &amp;ldquo;today&amp;rdquo; and was 2 degrees C all day long. It&amp;rsquo;s apparently going up to 16 or 18 degrees C tomorrow.
I chatted with Delayna who I&amp;rsquo;ve known since our mutual YRUU days back in late 1980s, culminating with ConCon 1988. Looking forward to seeing her herb business grow!</description>

      <description>17:06 Tuesday 23 January 2018 JST I woke up early to take pics of the snow and then helped scoop some of it up. I cleared a couple paths in a couple hours. It was pretty warm while working.
It&amp;rsquo;s about dark now; I have been inside on my computer, preparing to do my US taxes, on time this year (for a change).
Oh and I did an hour of MT3, but did not write an entry for it.</description>

Today is a holiday so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to go out into the snow. yay!
Today is a holiday called Coming of Age Day, when kids adults(?) who will turn 20 this year all put on their finest kimono and attend an speech by the local leaders who say, &amp;ldquo;okay you&amp;rsquo;re adults now; you can smoke and drink&amp;rdquo; and the kids at the back of the assembly get blasted on alcohol and make a big scene.</description>
