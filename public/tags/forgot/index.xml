      <description>13:16 Friday 01 December 2017 JST Well! I discovered something new about Tokyo trains. If I promise to pay at the other end, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to get a free entry ticket. I did not think to take a picture of the ticket, but its kanji started with 無 and may have started with 無理 but I am not sure I can readily identify the second kanji.
Anyway, I called Ty and he met me at his station to let me out.</description>
