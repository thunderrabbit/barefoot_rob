<p class=date>Tuesday 3 November 1998</p>

<p>Last week I didn't go to gymnastics because I hurt my ankle jumping over Maggie's couch.  I did go this week, but my ankle wasn't happy enough to do round off back handsprings on the floor.

<p>Today my heart just wasn't into tumbling.  I did several russians (russian style front flips) and 1 back hand spring.

<p>However, on the trampoline, I did a lot of fun stuff!

<p>Mostly I bounced and bounced like Thunder Rabbit does in the Sauna and I did a couple of back flips.  Then I did a ton of front flips, all in a row.

<p>Now, they weren't front flips landing on my feet each time, but front flips landing on my shoulders/back each time.  The first time I did them tonight, I was able to do 9 in a row.  I was a tad dizzy after that.

<p>The next time I did 12 in a row! 

<p>I did a couple of front handspring vaults, and a straddle vault and two (almost) stoop throughs (That's where my legs stay straight and go between my arms.)  The first one was good, but the second one I had bent knees.

<p>And then I had a delightful brainstorm.. Why not collect all the beanie babies that were strewn around the gym and bounce with them all on the trampoline?  I couldn't think of a good reason not to, so I collected 4 of them.

<p>{Boingy} {boingy} {boingy} {boingy} I went and they didn't bounce as high as I, but they boinged and binged and bounced around as I jumped.  

<p>I made up a game of seeing how few bounces I could take and bounce each of them high enough to catch all four.  (not necessarily at the same time)    After a little bit of practice, I was able to do it in 6 bounces.

<p>About 15 minutes of bouncing beanie babies was all I could handle, so I did a couple more vaults or something.. 

<p>It was about time to go home, so I did some final cool down leg stretches with Carrie (sp) who happens to live across the street from me, and went home.

<p class=date>Wednesday 21 October 1998</p>

<p>Yesterday was big fun at gymnastics.

<p>I've stopped practicing my round off back flips, and toned them down to round off back handsprings.

<p>Why? So I can do round off back handspring back flip, of course!  I've got to lower the angle/height/energy etc to get the back flip down to a back handspring.  I've also got to overcome my fear of bonking my head on back handsprings!  (That means I'll need to quit bonking my head by having my arms too far apart, and *that* means I'll need to continue stretching my shoulders so my arms can easily block my weight)

<p>Last night, BB (one of the coaches) would help spot me on the back handsprings.. Actually it was more of a psychological spot because he didn't actually help me over; he just stood beside me in case I crashed.  I would do a round off, stop, and then do a back handspring, with the goal of getting the stop to be shorter and shorter:  stop - stp - st - s -

<p>I became pretty confident at them (the confidence waxes and wanes) and only boinked my head a tiny bit once.  I even got the stop to be only a stp

<p>Near the end of the hour, I zipped over to the runway trampoline where Eric was trying some front flip half twist thing. We alternated passes on the trampoline, and I did my fun backflip, backflip, backflip, backflip, backflip with twist onto mat trick.  I get a teeny bit dizzy for a second after doing that!

<p>Then I was all, "I think I'll do a 1 and 3/4 front flip."

<p>The first one was nice.  {boingy} (flip fli) (land on back) Perfect.

<p>The second one was not as good.  {boingy} (flip fl) (land on head; hear a bit of a crunch in the neck)  Ow.

<p>BB was all, "Rob.  No.  Don't be trying that one again."

<p>I told him I woulda stopped anyway even without him saying so.

<p>"Good, because that was pretty spooky."

<p>"Well, at least it's near Halloween!"

<p>I went home and stayed up chatting with Jen over ICQ till damn 2am.

<p>This morning my neck is a bit sore, with slightly limited movement; I think I shall call my chiropractor now.

<p class=date>14 July 1998</p>

<p>Today after seeing Armageddon, but before gymnastics, I stopped by Smoothie King to get a smoothie.  I told the guy they should have a smoothie flavor called "groovy juice."

<p>"Groovy juice, eh?"

<p>"Yeah.. let me tell you what's in it."  I looked up at the ingredients list. "Um, wheat germ, bananas, soy protein, turbinado and honey."

<p>"That's it?"

<p>"Yeah.  This time."

<p>"do you want any fruit juices?"

<p>"whaddya got?"

<p>He rattled them off and I chose mango.

<p>I paid the cashier dude and the other guy handed me the smoothie.  "Here's your groovy juice."

<p>"Thanks!"  The weird thing is that I didn't even notice until after I left that he called it groovy juice!

<p>I slurped it down on the way to gymnastics, and I was so so so super energetic there!

<p>I stretched and chatted and we did the small tumbling passes: handstands, then cartwheels, then roundoffs..  And then I did round-off flips that were essentially pike position, but not layed out.

<p>BB encouraged me and gave me pointers and I kept going and going and the flips kept getting better and closer to layouts!
I was so energetic and kept going even while several of the others in line began to sit out a turn.

<p>Eating before gymnastics helps so much!!!!

<p>At about 5 minutes before time to go, I went to the big trampoline and did flips and flips and flips and was pretty much able to jump, flip and land at the same point on the trampoline. That was cool.

<p>Said bye to everyone and here I am!

<p class=date>5 May 1998</p>

<p>Tonight in gymnastics I did some pretty cool stuff. I did round off back flips but did not get them as layouts very well at all. We were on a different floor which seemed softer than the other.  I don't know if that really made a difference or not.

<p>But I did do a few russian front flips. "Russian" in that case is the style of motion used to power the flip. Arms swing in big forward circles and then lift from the back kinda. It's easier if I show you but I'm probably not physically with you as you read this. Maybe later.

<p>I bounced around on the runway tramp and just did a backflip with 1/2 twist. Cool. So I did it again and almost wacked the wall. Hmmm. So I did it again and after not too long pretty much had them stable and consistent. Half the time I would do a back branny (twist as I flip) and half the time I would do the beginning of an arabian (flip, and then twist). Cool stuff.

<p>Then Ryan and I got on the big trampolines and challenged each other to a front flip contest. We would flip and flip and flip and flip,... doing front flips and landing on our backs each time. Our feet never touched the trampoline.<br>
So anyway, we each got like 10 in a row, and by that time were pretty much too tired and dizzy to do much else.<br>
At least I was too tired. Ryan did some other stuff which I couldn't do and can't describe either, so oh well.

<p>It was a super fun night.</p>

<p class=date>21 April 1998</p>
<p>
Today in gymnastics after I did some stretching, but before we really got started, I did two standing back flips onto a big fat mat. Each time, I almost got all the way over. Cool. I haven't done those in years!
<p>
During our tumbling passes I was doing my round off back flips when BB said, "try doing layouts."
<p>
I was all, "err?"
<p>
He's like, "yeah.. you can do it... back flips are too easy for you now."
<p>
Layouts.  Hmmm.  So I did my next round off back flip and it was a stretched-out tuck.
<p>
I commented, "I'm not sure how it's supposed to feel for layout."
<p>
BB suggested "just point your toes and extend your legs.."
<p>
My next one was great! Not layed out, but I shouted "wow! I could really feel that was way way better!  Thanks!"
<p>
That was my best one of the night; I began to think too much and try too hard after that and they got kinda crappy.
<p>
I look forward to getting them perfect!
<p>
Once I could tell they weren't getting better that evening, I went to play on the runway tramp with Ryan, Tanya and Ashley.
<p>
Tanya is so funny, describing how her friends call her "HyperWoman" like the latest super heroine:  "HyperWoman! Quick! They need your help in China! Dig through the earth and save them!"
<p>
On the trampoline, Ryan and I traded various flips: one-and-one-quarter back flips and one-and-one-quarter or one-and-three-quarter front flips, plus high dive rolls or branny-to-back (1/2 twist one-and-one-quarter back flip) or whatever we want. I have great fun doing that.

<p class=date>Tuesday 31 March 1998</p>

<p>
Today in gymnastics, I did back handsprings again, and my standing ones were better than those I did last week!  (Plus I didn't rip my abs.)
<p>
I did some round off back handsprings, and they got better and better as I kept practicing and then they got crappy.  My arms forgot to land or they were all spread out or whatever.
<p>
Then I did one really good round off back handspring (really good for me) my arms were straight, though I landed in a crouched position of "am I alive? did I do it???"<br>
But it was straight and my arms were straight.
<p>
And then they got crappy again..  I couldn't even tell where my body was and aaaarrggggh!!!  I did some great standing ones, but my round off ones were dumb.
<p>
After class, I talked with Lindsey and her mom.  Lindsey is having the same problem I am: good standing back handsprings, but crappy round off back handsprings.
<p>
They told me about a gym out in Katy that has a much bigger better program than this one.  I may go check it out at 4:30pm this Sunday.</p>

                        <p><title>More Gymnastics</title></p>

<p class=date>Tuesday 24 March 1998<br></p>
<p>
Today I got to attend gymnastics again after the gym was closed for 2 weeks.  During those two weeks the moved to a larger facility and I love it!  The new place is way bigger and has two floors, two runway trampolines, two big trampolines, a vault, 1 high bar, 3 uneven bars, several low bars, and plenty of room for more stuff that hasn't been installed yet!
<p>
I did not really stretch or practice or anything for the two weeks, so I was a bit cautious on the floor.  My first bigger passes were just roundoffs, testing out my leg which I hurt playing Ultimate this weekend.
<p>
It felt pretty good, so I pulled some roundoff back flips, and once I did 3 goods ones in a row, I did a punch front flip.
<p>
Then I did some standing back handsprings! I haven't done them in years and years, and way back then I didn't do them super well.  But today they were as good as ever and getting better. I need to stretch out my tummy before I get too crazy doing those again.
<p>
Kenneth spotted me on about 4 in a row and I got pretty sloppy because of tired arms.
<p>
So I bounced over to the runway trampoline where Sarah, Tanya and Ashley were tumbling.  Sarah was doing roundoff backs with two twists; Tanya and Ashley were doing mostly back flips with 1/2 twists or just sloppy back flips.
<p>
I did some simple front flips and tried a couple of 1+1/4 back flips but never really got them straight enough to go all the way.
<p>
All too soon our 55 minutes was up, though we often stretch it out to and hour 15 minutes...  Not tonight.
<p>

<p class=date>19 Feb</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I went to gymnastics class for the first time in probably
3.5 to 4 years ??!!!!
<p>
Wow how wonderful it was to be back on that big bouncy blue carpet!<br />
<p>
We started with some walking handstands and then cartwheels then
roundoffs then after a bit I was doing roundoff back flips!! Big big
tall high back flips and I felt glorious and joyful!
After the hour of class, I went to the runway trampoline and did some
front flips and even was able to get a proper front layout flip once.
Way way way fun.
I got on the high bar, but after only a few swings, I could feel my palm
screaming &ldquo;RIP!&rdquo;
I didn&rsquo;t rip, but dropped off and wondered how I was able to do it
previously..  I think I need to loosen my grip some.
<p>
I met Nelson, Eric, Lyle, Catherine, Jennifer, Tasha, Kenneth, and BB.</p></p>

                        <p class="note">(transcribed from Book Six 1:54pm JST Sunday 28 June 2009 (day 14340))</p>

<p class="date">7:50PM Friday 3 December 1993 Day (Page44)</p>

<p>I have decided to not keep track of exactly what day I'm on each day.  I'll keep this pointer
back to page 44 that will tell me the last recorded day count so I can recalculate it.  The only
reason for this is that maybe the days will go by faster, not that they are going slowly now.
Heck, I don't know.</p>

<p>Wednesday after database lab ended at 6pm <del>we crui</del> I cruised to the VAX to work.
Maggie was there fucking around while John did his program.  Dave Psurney (also in database) &amp;
Steve Inman (database) &amp; I were working on SQL. Stupid fucker Hassan started SQL that night.
he hadn't attended class in weeks.  Dumb ass.</p>

<p>At 6PM Dave &amp; I were like, &quot;ok we have 18 hours.&quot; It felt like barely plenty of
time.  We worked &amp; worked &amp; I was hungry.  Maggie &amp; John cruised at 10pm &amp; brought
me 6 McDonald's hamburgers &amp; a shake.  I ate two of them immediately.</p>

<p>The VAX was incredibly slow as I was compiling my Pro*Pascal program at 10PM.  14 hours left.  I
called Heather &amp; told her I didn't know if I would be able to tutor her at 10:30AM I called
&amp; told Tanya I definitely could not type her gymnastics routine.</p>

<p>Each time I compiled my program it took a long ass time, so I would go back &amp; talk to Katy
(cutie that I met through Caleb) who was playing on a MUD &amp; working on Prob &amp; Stats.  She
cruised &amp; hugged me &amp; at one point had let me bite her (hand) &amp; wrote me a mail
message.</p>

<p>10 hours left.  Things looked bleak.  I called Heather &amp; told her.  Things better start
pulling together soon or I won't be happy.  Steve showed me how to do stuff with dates &amp; how to
put where conditions in cursor queries.  I showed him how to do labels &amp; stuff in Pascal.  He
saved me so much time that my project would have suffered severely.</p>

<p>Dave showed me how to do some shit with the last query - build a temporary table.</p>

<p>Steve cruised at 2am.</p>

<p>&quot;Dude. we have 10 hours left.&quot; &quot;I know.&quot;</p>

<p>Darell Spice left without finishing.</p>

<p>Things started pulling together.  I got all the first 9 queries working.  Then with knowelege [sic]
(sp) about how to build a temporary table I got #10 done.  Bad Ass.</p>

<p>I had finally finished my Pro*Pascal stuff after Steve had showed me the date stuff.</p>

<p>4:30AM. &quot;Dude. it's almost 5 o'clock in the morning.&quot;  &quot;Dude.&quot;  &quot;Dude
the sun is coming up!&quot;  There was a certain red glow outside but it may have just been city
lights.  At 5AM Mark Hartray stumbled in. (My old Poli Sci instructor.  ugh.)  He
looked <em>tired</em>.  heh.</p>

<p>Dave &amp; I were tired but generally optimistic &amp; getting all our stuff printed &amp;
organized &amp; talking the whole time.</p>

<p>AT 5:15 I realized Maggie was awake so I called her.  I told her that I just had one bit more to
do, but I couldn't muster enough to do it.  Sh rallied me but it didn't work.</p>

<p>We printed our stuff and got it all together.</p>

<p>&quot;Dude we've been here 8 hours.  Wait - we've been here wait we've been her [sic] fucking 12
hours.  Holy Shit.&quot;</p>

<p>I cruised and Dave had decided to do some last little stuff.</p>

<p>I ate one of the remaining 2 hamburgers on the way to my house.  I stopped by &amp; checked
everything <ins>&amp; got my key from Suzanne</ins> &amp; then went straight to Maggie's.  Rush
hour traffic was in effect.  I got there at exactly 7 as Maggie predicted &amp; I slept from 7AM to
9:30AM.</p>

<p>I met Heather at school &amp; tutored her &amp; then stayed awake in Graphics.</p>

<p>They are building new doors in PGH.  Dude.  The doors are slightly inside the current doors.</p>

<p>Marcel showed Pieroni his graphics program for 45 minutes &amp; then I typed my gymnastics
routine on his computer.</p>

<p>Christine showed up at gymnastics with a lady named Crystal.</p>

<p>I was the first to do the final routine.  I sat between Heather &amp; Laura to watch the rest.
Chris was really graceful &amp; beautiful.  Andy's was fresh &amp; required strength (which I was
unable to deliver being so tired)</p>

<p>I didn't make my first attempt at press to handstand so I barely made it when i tried again.
When I didn't get all the way to the corner of the floor I started making up shit to get there.
(One arm cartwheel &amp; something else.)  At the corner I had a long pause to make sure I had the
energy to pull of [sic] a round off back flip.  Barely.  So I exerted the hell out of myself to do
it &amp; i got it.  Bad Ass.</p>

<p>After all the routines, it was fuck around time.</p>

<p>I played &amp; talked to Christine &amp; goofed around.  Me Wasseim &amp; Aaron did some fun
trampoline stuff.  The game was to jump over the low uneven bar Then <del>wc</del> we high jumped it
&amp; then we put it on the high uneven bar spot.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/File:Page_50_Book_Six_snippet_3_December_1993.jpg"><img src="/w/images/4/47/Page_50_Book_Six_snippet_3_December_1993.jpg"
alt="springboards, tramp, tramp, highbar"/></a></p>

<p>We had this set up at one point.  We would jump jump jump &amp; fly to the bar and catch it.
Wasseim &amp; I would catch it backwards (I did it first) sometimes.  Cool.</p>

<p>I watched The Muppets Take Manhattan in the Houston Room &amp; <del>some</del> a female behind
me smelled really good but she wasn't exactly gorgeous.</p>

<p>On the way back to the dorms I saw Jessica (from The Hammock) &amp; Chris (SPB) &amp; Dawn
(Fountain) &amp; Elizabeth (Taub) setting up sound equipment by the wading fountain.  The band
didn't exactly show up so it became open mic.</p>

<p>Brad &amp; Fred &amp; I did a <del>barp</del> <del>burping</del> belching contest &amp;
entertained a bit.  Fred &amp; I did the bowling thing - It's been like 6 years since I saw (heard)
that done by Andy in high school.  Dude.  Fred &amp; I had never before gotten the chance to do
it.</p>

<p>Then I sat down by a girl named Amanda -wait.</p>

<p>I lay back on Dawn &amp; told her to bite me &amp; she didn't.  She teased me.  She said
&quot;here?&quot; &quot;it's been a long time since I've bitten anyone.&quot; &lt;Whimper&gt; She
teased me.</p>

<p>Then I sat down by a girl named Amanda who had stopped to listen while walking by.  I talked to
her a bit and asked if she wanted to perform for us.  She didn't but was content to listen.</p>

<p>A dude that just walked by sang &amp; gave us food from some party.  (cookies &amp; chips)</p>

<p>Then after no one was on the mic, I walked slowly up there.  I took the mic &amp; stood silently
for a moment &amp; then began.  I did Bill Cosby stuff - Taking a bath in the toilet - Chris had
the reverb on really loud - about 2 seconds apart for about 5 echoes.  That could be obnoxious, but
it forced me to slow down &amp; let the echo die down before I continued, thus allowing me time to
think &amp; collect my next sentence &amp; made my routine a bit funnier I think.</p>

<p>I also allowed me to hear myself to see how I was doing (well) and gave me confidence (I was
funny!)</p>

<p>I did Bill Cosby's thing on golf, (a stupid game) an a bit from the roadside sign one that Fred
does.</p>

<p>I was funny.  I did Bill Cosby's Fat Albert airplane cessna engine car.  I was funny.  Cool Cool
Cool.</p>

<p>Then the 5 echo long repeat thing made a very cool thing possible.  We had 5 microphones &amp;
people all making little random noises in each one.  Then big noises &amp; phrases &quot;Shut up
Lew!&quot; growls - it was fantastic - I really really wanted to record it - I <del>bit it</del>
bet it could be sold as music. <del>(Not</del> Not a whole CD of that, but a good 10 minutes.
Dawn's voice was beautiful on it - her little sighs &amp; whimpers &amp; moans &amp; hums &amp;
noises for which there is no name were fantastic Enigma type stuff.</p>

<p>We did that for at least an hour.  I really would love a recording of it.</p>

<p>On the way out through Taub, I stopped by Britt's &amp; sat by her on her bed &amp; she was not
pleased with Scott in general, but he was there studying.  She made my day by holding my arm as I
was beside her.  I loved it.</p>

<p>I got to bed Thursday night at about midnight.  So I got 2.5 hours of sleep in 38.75 hours.
Cool.</p>

<p>This morning (Friday) Laura came over at about 7 AM &amp; tried to sleep though she had taken
Vivarin.  I cuddled &amp; smooched on her and stuff.  We did some crotch grinding, but nothing
more.</p>

<p>She cruised &amp; I wrote my report for project 2 Database.  I drove to school specifically to
turn it in &amp; I came back &amp; slept for 3 hours.  Now here I am.</p>

<p>I thought of a funny thing to say on someone's answering machine.  &quot;HI.  This is Rob.  It's
1:27 and I wait it's 1:29 1:30 oh - that's my CD player...&quot;</p>

<p>Check you later.</p>

<p class=date>May 19 1987 Tuesday</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherman liked the movie.  I finished my Algebra II final
except for the parabola.  Rob and Neil stayed up all night working.
Literally. They slept all day until 6th period (Algebra) when they
came to school.  Tomorrow I have a meeting to go to for rifles.  We
will get measured for our outfits.  I talked to Heather Lakatos some
in Algebra today. I also gave her a shoulder/back massage.  She said
she liked it. I hope she will let me give her more.  Today in
gymnastics, I did 2 flyaways.  On my next try, I hit the bar with my
foot.  It hurts a little Still.  The NUTS get to have our own room in
church.  That will be great.  Though it has no windows.  We will paint
some maybe.  I can't wait.  Well, Goodnight 11:00. PM</p>
