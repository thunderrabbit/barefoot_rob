<p>In an attempt to disrupt this unity among Palestinians on both sides of the Armistice Line, the Wall has been built right down the middle of the village, separating families and neighbors, shopkeepers and customers from their markets, people from their work, and children from their schools. 216 shops and houses have been demolished close to where the Wall has been built. 600 out of the previously existing 1,200 shops had to close.</p>

<p>This was actually sent to me a long time ago, but I&rsquo;m just now getting it posted</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi All, it&rsquo;s been a while I know! Partly my lack of emails is because i&rsquo;m not very good at keeping in touch (as pointed out very clearly by my sister last week!) and partly because I didn&rsquo;t think I had that much to report. I&rsquo;m settled here now and my life has it&rsquo;s routine just like it did in the UK. That&rsquo;s what I thought until I had an instant-messenger conversation with a friend a couple of nights ago:
Me: “Everything&rsquo;s good here, very quiet really, except for the birds, spring is definitely here!”
Neil: “I read things were bad in Hebron, have you been back recently?”
Me “Oh yes, i was there last week and couldn&rsquo;t leave cos the army invaded and sealed off the checkpoint. The settlers had driven a JCB into the Old city- they want to expand their colony and were trying to knock down some Palestinian owned shops. Oh, and Beit Jala was raided early yesterday morning- I slept through it! And another raid into Bethlehem, I swear I&rsquo;m bad luck, everytime I go to do my shopping the army seem to follow me! Not so quiet then I guess&hellip;”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After only 5 months this has all become a bit normal for me. If I don&rsquo;t see it happening with my own eyes i hear of it on the radio or TV- everyday- Hebron, Tubas, Nablus, Jenin, a village, a refugee camp raided, one teenager dead, one child shot but still alive, several with rubber bullet injuries, an elderly woman collapsed from tear gas inhalation. A couple of days ago Al Walajah was raided just as my friend Ahamd was leaving his home. They had come to arrest a 17 year old boy. The only reason Ahmad told me was because it was part of a funny story about the bad day he&rsquo;d had- it started with the army raiding his village and making him late for school, then at school he got into trouble for being late from the headmaster, he was kept back after school but couldn&rsquo;t call to tell his brother as his phone had no credit&hellip;.etc etc. An army helicopter and harrassment from fully armed soldiers was just an incinental part of his story.
This isn&rsquo;t accidental, this normalisation of daily violence and injustice, it&rsquo;s a survival strategy. When I&rsquo;d been here for about three months I went through a period when i couldn&rsquo;t sleep. Whenever i tried my mind would begin to wander and i&rsquo;d strart thinking and getting upset about things I&rsquo;d seen and heard that day: my friend Wael worrying about money, playing with the four lovely children that he&rsquo;s so worried about finding the money to feed, remembering going through the Bethlehem checkpoint and having to explain in bad arabic how it all worked to a bewildered woman visiting her family for the first time if 5 years or remebering that i&rsquo;d noticed that the construction of the aparthied wall was creeping ever closer to Walajeh or thinking about a report on Al Jazeera that quoted Condaliza Rice saying that sanctions on Palestine wouldn&rsquo;t lifted until Hamas recognised Israels right to exist and another report that said that the number of illegal Israeli colonies had increased again during 2006 and&hellip;&hellip;.
It was driving me crazy, and this isn&rsquo;t even my country&hellip;
I told a friend about this and asked how he coped with it day in day out. He said that he&rsquo;d stopped himself thinking about it. If he saw a soldier beating a friend at a checkpoint he&rsquo;d cry about it there and then, and then push all feelings and memories of it aside and lock them away. If he didn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d go mad. He advised me to stop watching Al Jazeera just before I go to bed.
So this is what i&rsquo;ve done. Most nights I manage to fall asleep, if i feel my mind wandering i gather up those memories and put them aside. I have wild and crazy dreams and wonder what this is doing to my mental health, but at least i am sleeping.</p>

<p>And all of this after just 5 months. Just imagine what it must be like if this was your country, your entire life, past present and foreseeable future&hellip;.</p>

<p>Two weeks in Bethlehem (a city smaller than Leeds):
Bethlehem city raided three times.
Aida Camp raided twice
Al Walajah village raided one
Al Khader village raided once
Al Souwara village raided once
Beit Jala raided twice
16 taken to unknown locations by the Israeli army.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m losing it&hellip;seriously&hellip;i think I&rsquo;m forgetting the meaning of words like &ldquo;peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;ceasefire&rdquo; and &ldquo;routine&rdquo;. Today I had a day off and went to meet a friend of mine from Bethlehem who has recently started a new job with UNESCO in Ramallah. We met for a long lunch and then went shopping in Ramallah&rsquo;s busy town centre. Then the army arrived. Bulldozers first, shunting parked cars out of the way, some into shop fronts. Close behind were the armoured jeeps. No announcements: tear-gas, then sound grenades, then live fire. A helicopter above, backing up he ground troops with overhead fire. We were caught so unaware that I have to admit we both panicked and fled with other shoppers, young and old into the nearest store. We flinched and held hands with every gunshot and explosion from the other side of the metal shutters. .</p>

<p>Of course, we needn&rsquo;t have worried. This was just a &ldquo;routine arrest operation&rdquo;. So tell me, am I losing it? Have I been here too long? What exactly is routine about four dead people and twenty seriously injured? Routine to me was mothers and children, on holiday from school, going about their business, buying food and clothes, meeting friends for lunch&hellip;.right?</p>

<p>Today in Palestine: Ramallah raided, Bethlehem raided, Tubas raided, two villages close to Bethlehem raided, four dead, 35 injured, 9 arrested, so far. But Israel wants only peace and to protect <em>itself</em> from terrorists. A new colony approved in the West Bank to house the illegal Israeli &ldquo;settlers&rdquo; removed from the Gaza strip; 55,000 new Israeli houses to be built on land stolen from the village I volunteer in, the village that now has an unemployment rate of around 75%&hellip;.peace?</p>

<p>Like I say, i really think i&rsquo;m losing it, I hear the words Israel speaks but my eyes won&rsquo;t let me believe them&hellip;anyone any advice for a confused girl?</p>

                        <p>##10:50 Friday 15 December 2006</p>

<p>Hi everyone,
It&rsquo;s been a while since my last mass email and I&rsquo;ve had a couple of
those &ldquo;are you still alive&rdquo; emails that I love as they prove to me
that you all miss me (ie they&rsquo;re good for my ego!) and make me laugh!
I have to say that I&rsquo;ve started writing this email a few times, but
every time I&rsquo;ve given up as the words seemed a little empty. The past
few weeks in my new home have been, typically, both great and heart
breaking. I&rsquo;m now working in the village Walajah that i emailed you
all about a few weeks ago. It&rsquo;s great to be part of such a small,
close community, and as such I&rsquo;m having to walk up all of the steep
hills around here to work off all of the food I&rsquo;m being fed at every
opportunity! It can be so quiet and peaceful here, that it&rsquo;s easy to
forget about the &ldquo;situation&rdquo; (as everyone here calls it!), and think
that i&rsquo;m living in some pretty Mediterranean town (which I am).
However,  and there&rsquo;s always a however, in the past week and a half
there&rsquo;s been three incursions by the army.
The first was to demolish a building and a house. After much arguing,
a local lawyer prevented the home demolition, but the outbuilding was
destroyed.
The second was in the early hours.The army came and forced a family
out of their home with tear gas and sound grenades. They then forced
the father of the family to strip to his underwear in the freezing
cold and lay on the ground before arresting him. His crime? He works
for an orphanage in Bethlehem that is supported by the social services
part of Hamas. He is still detained. His teenage daughter who I&rsquo;ve
been helping with her english homework was too upset to attend an exam
last week.
The third is the one that always gets me. Two days ago the home of
Monder Hamad was demolished for the second time this year, to make way
for &ldquo;the wall&rdquo; deemed illegal by the International court. So this is
my problem: witnessing this was one of the most traumatic points of my
life, and this isn&rsquo;t my house, my village or even my country. How can
i scrape together the words to describe how heart breaking it is to
watch such a personal injustice occur? A family torn apart by well
armed teenagers with all of the power, friends and family kept away
unable to offer comfort. A few of us able to help the family empty
their lives out onto the street before&hellip;. Even as I write it now it
seems empty. The soldier&rsquo;s reply to the desperate question: &ldquo;where
shall we live?&ldquo;&hellip;.&ldquo;We gave you a tent last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So do me a favour, think about how this would make you feel, spare us
a thought over the holidays, and next time you hear about Hamas
refusing to recognise Israels right to exist bear in mind the
continuous humiliations and tragedies inflicted on every Palestinian:
man, woman and child.</p>

<p>Suzy xx</p>

                        <p>##20:38 Friday 06 January 2006</p>

<p>By now you may be aware that I am in Jerusalem with the four other delegates from the Olympia-Rafah Sister City Project, and Cindy and Craig Corrie. We chose to leave Gaza Wednesday morning after two men came to our apartment late Tuesday night asking us to go with them under the false pretense that we would be safer staying in their home. Our host in Rafah recognized this as an attempt to kidnap us and cautiously navigated the situation resulting in the bizarre scenario of the men shaking each of our hands and leaving. Though this experience was nerve-wracking at no point did I feel I was in any physical danger.</p>

<p>Kidnapping of foreigners has become increasingly common throughout the past month as the upcoming legislative elections get closer. The past week and a half in Rafah much of our time was spent discussing our safety.  Our Palestinian friends in Rafah were very attentive and aware of the developing situation. Together with their support and guidance we attempted to navigate these unfortunate circumstances. Earlier on the day this incident occurred, our friends in Rafah strongly recommended that we leave for our own safety. Based on their concerns we had agreed to leave earlier than expected, though our rapid good-byes came more quickly than anticipated after our attempted kidnapping.</p>

<p>I meant to send out this report before this incident took place, but as circumstances in Gaza have become increasingly unstable and our situation shifted daily I found myself constantly having to update this report. I have decided to send it now as I think it contextualizes our attempted kidnapping in this pre-election period.</p>

<p>Last week as I sat in the Internet café a block from my apartment in Rafah reading the latest news from throughout Gaza and the West Bank I was left feeling vulnerable and uncertain. I was struck by how chaotic and unruly it all sounded, yet sitting there quietly reading and writing, being served free cups of hot tea by the young men who run the café, the stories on the screen felt distant and unrelated to my reality.</p>

<p>It had been difficult for me to write these past few weeks. I think it had to do with the fact that I felt more settled in, more at home. I had my routine. Each morning I woke up, stretched, made a pot of Turkish coffee on our one electric stove and headed out to a meeting, presentation, or some other sort of social gathering. The ability to create a routine in the midst of an uncertain, potentially dangerous situation grounded me. At the same time I was left feeling disoriented and disconnected from the events surrounding me.</p>

<p>I know the work I am doing, helping establish various cross-cultural projects, for example creating a network to sell women’s fair trade embroidery in Olympia or facilitating the connection between an elementary school class in Rafah and a school in Olympia, is a part of a larger vision. I know that this work is one project of many designed to educate people in the US about Palestine and the role the US government plays in continuing the occupation here. And as my friends in Rafah emphasize, educate people in Palestine about the American people and those of us who oppose the actions of the US government. But it is hard sometimes to feel that all of these things are in any way related to the daily realities of life in Gaza.</p>

<p>Daily I saw or heard second hand about the latest unrest in Gaza. The almost nightly bombings that have taken place over northern Gaza, the targeted assassinations, the implementation and blatant redeployment by the Israeli military of a “no-go zone” stretching 1.5 miles inside of Gaza on the northern and eastern boarders. The daily take-over of Palestinian electoral offices by various Palestinian factions angry over broken promises of jobs and positions of authority with in the PA (Palestinian Authority). Last week&rsquo;s news of two men killed by the IOF (Israeli Occupation Force) for being within the “no go zone”. News of two Islamic Jihad members killed by an apache helicopter air strike as they were driving in Gaza City one evening. The events taking place in Gaza are endless, one follows the other faster than I can learn about what is taking place.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, as we drove out of Rafah heading towards Gaza City I looked out the window of the taxi and saw armed Palestinian police in their blue uniforms surrounding a group of masked men leaning against a near-by wall. I later learned that the men were demanding space on the ballot of the upcoming legislative elections scheduled to take place January 25th. With the run up to the elections tension mounts daily as gun fights and election office take-overs are increasingly common.</p>

<p>Even as I see glimpses of the reality, laying in bed reading while listening nightly to the shelling and bombing over Gaza City. Holding in my hand the one notice of warning Israel has given to those living and working inside the area Israel has declared a “no go zone”. It reads: “Residents of Northern Gaza, terrorists are launching missiles from beside your houses. The IDF (Israel Defense Force) is working to defend the security of Israel and they will continue pursuing the terrorists. You must leave this area. Staying will put your lives in danger. IDF Leadership.” Or walking through downtown Rafah as a parade of Palestinian police cars and trucks crammed full of police men with guns occasionally shooting into the air in an attempt to clear the traffic from their path as they mourned the loss of a fellow police officer earlier in the week. I still felt on the periphery of all that was taking place.</p>

<p>But every now and again an experience or story would jolt me back into what it really meant to be living Gaza. I felt this more strongly in the past few days, as the unstable situation in Gaza has resulted more and more frequently in the kidnapping of foreigners.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday three Brits were kidnapped as they entered Gaza from Rafah Crossing. I am relieved to say that on Friday they were released unharmed and the woman who was kidnapped and has been working in Gaza for the past year will continue her work here. I breathed a sign of relief upon hearing this news. But almost a quickly as my concerns were dispelled news of another kidnapping surfaced. The man, Italian, was released unharmed in a matter of hours after the PA took an active role in securing his release. These incidents heightened our awareness of our surroundings and sparked many conversations and concern from Palestinians regarding our safety.</p>

<p>Listening to the concerns and advice from our friends in Rafah, we had made the decision Tuesday afternoon to leave Gaza by the end of the week. Our remaining time in Rafah was shortened even further after the attempted kidnapping we experienced Tuesday night. As we said rapid good-byes to the few friends who were able to see us off I still could not process that we were leaving. Our time in Rafah was cut short and it was painful to leave all the people I have come to know and love, yet the two months we were able to spend there were amazing.</p>

<p>We accomplished many of the goals we began with and laid the foundation for continued cooperation and cross-cultural connection to take place. Continuing this work is extremely important and sends a strong message of our commitment to solidarity with the Palestinian people in spite of the action of a small sector of the population carrying out the kidnappings. The act of kidnapping foreigners will not deter us from our commitment to the Palestine people, and the people of Rafah in particular.</p>

<p>We will continue to work in solidarity with Palestinians as stopping sets a precedent for internationals to discontinue their work in Gaza. Such actions would send the message that the acts of a few have the potential to dismantle years of energy put towards building trust and understanding between Palestinian’s and internationals in Gaza. We will continue to foster the friendships we made during our two months in Rafah and find creative ways to carry out the projects we began despite our rapid departure.</p>

<p>I feel incredibly supported by the friends we have made in Rafah. They gave all their spare time to accompanying us when we traveled and constantly checked in with us wanting to know that we were okay when they were not around. As one friend put it, “We will provide you with security not with weapons, but with our friendship and love”</p>

<p>The kidnappings taking place in Gaza are different and unrelated to the kidnappings taking place in Iraq. They are a part of the internal power struggle in Gaza. The majority of kidnappings have been used to pressure the PA for jobs within the Authority, or to secure the release of friends or family jailed by the PA. In Iraq kidnappings are employed to release prisoners held by the US or to demand an end to the Occupation.  In Iraq kidnappings are used as collateral to pressure an external power whose control is not affected by the kidnappings. Yes, it represents the sense of chaos and lack of control the US maintains over Iraq, but the media uses it to justify the continued occupation under the guise of achieving security before leaving. The US will not give in to the demands of the kidnappers as they feel it will display a weakness in US foreign policy.</p>

<p>Kidnappings in Gaza are primarily used to put pressure on the internal power players, namely the Palestinian Authority. In the eyes of the international community these acts do not benefit the PA in any way, but rather undermine their legitimacy. The media is more than willing to uses the kidnappings to discredit the PA. Saying such things as “mayhem in the Gaza Strip&hellip;.has embarrassed Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, threatening to undermine his Fatah Party…”</p>

<p>It doesn’t take much thought to determine that the rationale of kidnapping foreigners to be used as bargaining chips in Gaza are borrowed from Iraqi resistance to the US occupation, but the goals and politics behind them differ. The phenomenon of kidnapping in Gaza is new. It had been the topic of conversation everywhere we went in Rafah and without fail the people we met condemn these acts. My analysis about this is in no way comprehensive but having spent countless hours with dozens of Palestinians discussing this I feel I should share some of what I heard.</p>

<p>Many people I have spoken with see the kidnappings as a sign of unrest due to the upcoming elections. It is one aspect of the larger climate that has developed here during the election season. This is a phase, growing pains that Palestine is experiencing as it attempts to hold its first legislative elections since 1996. People have hope that post-election the situation will change, as a governmental structure will take shape challenging the unruly atmosphere that currently exists. There is still talk of the elections being canceled though people remain optimistic that they will take place.</p>

<p>Last summer&rsquo;s Israeli disengagement, or rather, redeployment left a power vacuum leading various political factions jockeying for control. The PA has been weakened and the Palestinian public views it with skepticism because of internal corruption as well as Israel successfully undermining their credibility through such policies as unilateral decision making. Despite Israel&rsquo;s redeployment it has continued to exploit the daily lawlessness in Palestine and Gaza in particular. With threats to prohibit Palestinians in East Jerusalem from voting due to Hamas&rsquo; participation in the elections, with the creation of a &ldquo;no go zone&rdquo;, targeted assassinations as I mentioned earlier, and on and on the occupation of Gaza and the West Bank undoubtedly play a role in the ensuing state of unrest in Gaza.</p>

<p>To expect that Palestine, lacking status as an independent country, can effectively hold elections while under military occupation is unrealistic. I hear criticism of the PA for not controlling the unfolding events taking place in Gaza but the inability of the PA to govern Gaza is not purely a home grow problem. Yes, there is corruption within the PA contributing to its ineffectiveness, but one cannot deny the role Israel has played in undermining its ability to establish any sort of credible and therefore effective government. Due in large part to the continued Israeli occupation the PA is unable to provide basic services and meet the needs of the people. This has ripened the playing field for others to step up to bat.  In this pre-election season we see these power struggles playing out in the streets, in electoral offices, and in the use of foreigners to pressure the PA to acknowledge the interests of individuals and groups.</p>

<p>It is an intense but fascinating time to be in Palestine. In spite of the kidnapping attempt I am thankful that I was able to experience some of what it is like to be in a place where people feel passionate about their lives, their hope for freedom and for a better future. I do not agree with many of the tactics employed by various Palestinian factions but I cannot deny that there is much more participation in the political process in Palestine than in the United States.</p>

<p>As the international media continues to portray the instability in Gaza as solely the fault of the PA and armed militant groups we must recognize the role our government and the Israeli government&rsquo;s policies have played in creating the events now unfolding. In this globalized world we have the ability to witness and support grassroots movement for justice taking place all over the world. Building relationships with those whom our government categorizes as &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo; or &ldquo;communists&rdquo; breaks down these generalizations and lays the foundation for trust to be fostered. I have experienced the strength and power this work holds and have see the positive impact of even the simplest acts of solidarity.</p>

<p>##11:35 Friday 16 December 2005</p>

<p>I have been agonizing over this document for weeks.  My basic task is to write about my experiences in the occupied territories of Palestine, but I find it impossible to actually put to paper anything that could get across the idea of the reality there.</p>

<p>My friends have asked me questions, and I find the answers difficult because I have to keep &ldquo;backing up&rdquo; to give context before anything can make sense.  One reason is that nothing here makes sense.</p>

<p>During my travels in summer 2005, I met an Israeli woman named Eilat, and a Palestinian woman named Niveen.  During a series of workshops, they described the conflict with which they live every day.  My short, generalized version of the story goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>     In the land basically between the Mediterranean Sea and the
     western border of Jordan, people live with tension and fear on a
     daily basis.  Israelis and Palestinians (taken as a group) each
     believe they have the right to live in the area.

     Palestinians say they have lived there for generations and want
     to remain.  Israelis say they are blessed by God to live in the
     area.

     Supported by various western governments, Jewish people were
     given financial and military support to move into the area.
     After World War II, Jews from Europe were encouraged to move to
     this area, for it was &quot;a land with no people&quot; and they were &quot;a
     people with no land.&quot;

     The countries in the middle east were clumped together and it was
     assumed that the arabs who lived in the area could simply move to
     other middle eastern countries with the rest of the arabs.

     The area was renamed Israel and declared a nation by the United
     Nations in 1948.

     The local Palestinians (as well as other arabs) got angry and in
     1967 fought back against what they saw as an invasion.  The
     Israelis, with superior firepower (via the US and British
     governments) won the war and expanded their territory, assuming
     control of West Bank and Gaza, further displacing Palestinians
     from their cities and villages.

     Palestinians fought back with bombings and the Israeli
     government decided the obvious solution was to build a wall
     around Palestinian areas and control access to/from and within
     this area.

     There is a separation barrier being built now.  Some of the
     barrier is in the form of an 8 meter tall concrete wall, which
     attracts a great deal of graffiti, both from Palestinian and
     international Palestinian supporters.  Most of the separation
     barrier is actually a fence, which does not look so unsightly,
     but takes up more space: it's a fence, with electric sensors, and
     a tracer road on one side (a dirt road kept smooth so that
     footprints can be detected easily), then the fence, then a patrol
     road, then another tracer road.

     Checkpoints on highways and in the separation barrier (where
     highways used to be) slow traffic within the occupied
     territory.

     Palestinians face great difficulties getting permits to build
     homes, and many therefore resort to building without a permit.
     The resulting &quot;illegal&quot; homes face the threat of demolition at
     any time.

     Suicide bombing attacks by Palestinian terrorists on Jewish
     citizens keep some Israelis on edge.

     Non-suicide attacks by Israeli terrorists against Palestinian
     citizens keep some Palestinians on edge.

<p>I found this description beyond reasoning; beyond belief.  I was assured I could visit the area and see for myself.  So upon return to Japan, I set out to do that.  I bought air tickets and did some research about what I could do once I arrived in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>I found the International Solidarity Movement (<a href="https://www.palsolidarity.org/main/">ISM</a>) and decided I could start there and see what else I find once I was in the area.</p>

<p>Basically, the ISM encourages international volunteers to come work in solidarity with Palestinians against the challenges they face, whether from Jewish settlers or Israeli border police.</p>

<p>From 15 October to 15 November, the ISM planned to join Palestinians during the annual olive harvest, as some Palestinian farmers face persecution and violence when they try to harvest olives near Jewish settlements (*).  These dates corresponded nicely with dates I was able to travel, so I told people I would be taking place in the Olive Harvest, though I didn&rsquo;t really know what that meant at the time.</p>

<p>(*) <a href="https://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE150852003?open&amp;of=ENG-ISR">Amnesty International on Israeli settlements</a></p>

<p>I encountered relatively little difficulty coming into the airport.  I had heard that I should <em>not</em> say I wanted to join ISM, because that could get me deported.  I simply told the woman at immigration that I was coming to tour Jerusalem.  She asked me where I would go exactly, and I said I didn&rsquo;t know, but my friend did.  She asked who was my friend and I told her Niveen.  She looked surprised, &ldquo;what??&rdquo; for I had given the name of my Palestinian friend.  I said, &ldquo;Eilat,&rdquo; and began to get out Eilat&rsquo;s address and phone number.  She said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry&rdquo; and gave my passport back.  I had entered the country.</p>

<p>I thought my next challenge was getting to the Faisal Hostel.  I only knew it was &ldquo;across from Damascus Gate in Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I then suddenly realized I had no money.  I tried all the ATMs in the airport with my MasterCard (which had been set up as an ATM card by the company) but was unable to get money from any of the machines in the airport.  Fortunately, there was a bank inside the airport near the entrance lobby.  There, I was able to talk to a teller who gave me 400 New Israeli Shekels (NIS) for US$85.  I was quite happy with this, for I had read somewhere that I could expect to spend 100 NIS per week.  (The next day I learned it was 100 US$ per week.)</p>

<p>Cash in hand, I set out to find transportation to Jerusalem.  I didn&rsquo;t know how much it should cost, but I went outside and found the trains and shuttles. The train to Jerusalem was 19 NIS. The shuttle driver wouldn&rsquo;t quote me a price but I ended up taking it anyway, trusting I would end up closer to my destination that some train station in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>After quite a lot of antics featuring people with distinctly two sets of outfits (that I will grossly stereotype as Arab and Jewish), jabbering in languages unintelligible to me, getting on and off and on and off the shuttle, we finally left.  I was quite afraid that I and/or my luggage would not make it safely to the hostel, but I sat quietly, trusting everything would be fine.</p>

<p>After quite some distance traveled through open desert and rugged hilly terrain, a guy asked me in English where I was from and where I was going and stuff.  I told him United States and Damascus Gate, respectively. He made sure my destination was communicated to the driver (who I thought had already been told by the guy on the curb who I told in the first place), and then said it was all good.</p>

<p>We dropped off various people at various places and then I was asked to get off and transfer to another shuttle in the middle of the street.  I gave my driver a 50NIS note, as the other passengers had been, and got 5 NIS back. I believe it was the same price the other passengers had been paying.</p>

<p>Changed shuttles, didn&rsquo;t go but about a kilometer or 2 and then was dropped off at what could have been the middle of the edge of a city, and I had no idea where to turn.</p>

<p>I asked a man for directions to Damascus Gate and he pointed me down a street. I didn&rsquo;t get too far when I saw a couple about my age and appearance.  It turns out they were headed to the same hostel as me.  Wonderful.</p>

<p>In subsequent experience traveling around the West Bank, I found the drivers of buses and shared taxis to be quite reliable and honest.  The prices for personal taxis were much higher and often far more expensive than market value.</p>

<hr />

<p>The first couple days I was in Jerusalem, I spent exploring the Old City of Jerusalem and some Israeli markets in West Jerusalem.  The contrast was quite striking.</p>

<p>The clothing was quite different in the two areas.  In the Israeli markets, people mostly wore &ldquo;normal&rdquo; western clothes, with a few women wearing head scarves. I was most intrigued by the Hasidic Jewish men, who had shaved heads except for sometimes-curled long tails on both sides, and wore two hats each (a bowl shaped form-fitting hat and a black top hat) and long black coats and pants.  Some men had guns in their belts.</p>

<p>In the Palestinian markets, most of the women had scarves covering their heads and generally wore long robes covering their bodies.  Some of the younger women and girls wore more western style clothing, but often still with head scarves.  Most men wore western style pants and shirts, though some wore flowing robes.  Some had skull caps, but none wore top hats, except for Hasidic Jewish men.  No Palestinian men had guns in their belts.</p>

<p>Prices in the Israeli markets and in the Israeli quarter of the Old City were higher than the prices in Palestinian markets.</p>

<p>The Palestinian markets were cramped and littered with rubbish, whereas the Israeli markets were wider, and had little or no visible rubbish.</p>

<p>In both the Israeli markets and Palestinian markets, Israeli Border Police walked around or stood around monitoring things.  They usually had their rifles slung on their backs over a shoulder, but sometimes carried them at their side.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Faisal Hostel is where I based most of my activities in the West Bank.  It&rsquo;s located right across from Damascus Gate of the Old City in Jerusalem.  I had arrived during Ramadan, meaning the Old City was more crowded than usual as people went there to pray in the evenings. One of my first nights in the hostel, several of us spent a lot of time looking out the window, watching the activity of soldiers running around and riding horses with flashing red and blue lights. It was pretty neat, but a bit scary to wonder what they were all doing.</p>

<hr />

<p>After a few days in Jerusalem, I attended the ISM olive harvest training in Ramallah (a city 18kilometers (11 miles) north of Jerusalem).  During the trip there, I got my first glimpse of a checkpoint.</p>

<p>There is a highway between Ramallah and Jerusalem, which would make the trip take about 15 minutes by car. However, the highway has been effectively blocked by a checkpoint, the wall for which was under construction when I visited the area.  Cars may not pass the checkpoint without waiting in a long line for a thorough inspection.</p>

<p>Instead of suffering this wait, people hire a taxi or shuttle to the checkpoint parking lot, carry their belongings across the checkpoint, find another taxi or shuttle to continue their journey.  The 15 minute trip to Ramallah becomes 35 or 40 minutes as a result.</p>

<p>The way from Ramallah into Jerusalem is even more difficult, as the walk across the checkpoint includes passing through a metal detector, an actual ID check by Israeli border police, and inspection of what one may be carrying (groceries or luggage).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s called Qalandia Checkpoint, and rumor suggests the security could get even tighter on the way from Jerusalem to Ramallah.</p>

<hr />

<p>What I thought would be the olive harvest training had absolutely nothing to do with olives.  It was the ISM training, teaching us about International Solidarity Movement, Palestinian culture, three distinct legal systems in the area, our legal rights, the differences between soldiers and police, how to defuse violent situations, how to de-arrest people, how to protect ourselves against sound bombs, rubber bullets, tear gas, and arrest, about affinity groups, settlers, other organizations in the area, regions with ISM activity, post traumatic stress disorder, emergency procedures, etc etc etc&hellip;. and I recognized I was <em>not</em> ready to deal with all that.  I chose not to become immediately active in ISM.</p>

<hr />

<p>Instead, I went to Palestinian Vision, a Palestinian NGO that focuses on the future of Palestine, and helps Palestinian youth find their identities, and supports communication between Palestinian and Israeli youth.  I was able to help by writing letters and grant proposals; they have great expenses and need benefactors, most of which seemed to be from the United States or Great Britain.</p>

<p>This organization helped me see that despite the chaos happening outside, people were seeking to continue normal lives, and striving for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, without acting directly in the conflict areas.</p>

<p>I met some wonderful people at PalVision; everyone was friendly and welcoming.  I learned a little bit of Arabic, and learned why it&rsquo;s so challenging to have an Israeli-Palestinian discussion anywhere in this area. Basically the checkpoints and culture won&rsquo;t allow the two groups to mix.</p>

<hr />

<p>One day, Rami, the director of Palestinian Vision, invited me to go to Nablus with some other PalVision volunteers.  I was keen to visit new places, and looked forward to the trip.  We planned to go on October 12th in the morning.  There was some concern that we would not be able to come back that evening, if we tried to leave too late.  Yom Kippur, a Jewish national holiday would start, and it was possible the Israeli border police would simply close the checkpoint outside Nablus.</p>

<p>No one said the checkpoint was scheduled to close during Yom Kippur, but just warned that it could close, at the whim of the border police and their holiday plans.</p>

<hr />

<p>In Nablus, we met several people from an NGO that partners with PalVision.  We were given a tour of the Old City in Nablus.  It seemed a lot like the old city of Jerusalem, but smaller and no Israeli soldiers.  It was packed with shops selling food, brushes, clothes, electronics, phones, fans, foul, and everything else.</p>

<p>We were told about the recent history of violence in the city.  We saw a parking lot that had been a soup factory, but destroyed in April 2002, during an invasion the Palestinians call the &ldquo;big invasion.&rdquo; It was during the second year of intifada which began in September 2000.</p>

<p>No soldiers were present while we were there, but the evidence of past and recent violence was clear.  Bullet holes in various stone walls, rubble filled lots where houses had been, posters of &ldquo;martyrs,&rdquo; Palestinians who had died fighting for their own freedom.</p>

<p>One memorial looked a lot like a public phone box.  A man had been killed when he tried to use the phone that used to be there.</p>

<hr />

<p>During the day we learned the checkpoint would be closed, so we left Nablus early to &lsquo;escape&rsquo; before they closed it.  There were many cars lined up to get out, and hundreds of Palestinian men in a line.</p>

<p>We simply used white privilege to get through the checkpoint at Nablus. Though the Palestinians were trapped behind the barrier, we just walked out through the in gate, briefly showed our passports to the soldiers and got through.</p>

<p>The border would close in a couple hours for Yom Kippur, and stay closed for 24 or 36 hours.</p>

<p>I wondered what action is appropriate.  Should I refuse to go through unless they let everyone else through? Just wait in queue? Simply ask why they can&rsquo;t go through???</p>

<p>We made it home without further issue.</p>

<hr />

<p>On another occasion, my trip back from Nablus was different.  There had just been an attack in West Bank, killing 3 Israelis.  One result was for traffic to be stopped from going into Jerusalem.  I was in a shared taxi with Palestinians going from Nablus to Qalandia.  However, we kept being stopped at flying checkpoints that had been set up on the highways.  At the time, I had no idea about the attack, and wondered why we kept being stopped.</p>

<p>During the whole experience, I was most surprised by the Palestinians&rsquo; reaction to being stopped and turned around repeatedly for an hour and a half at different checkpoints: none.  As we saw that we would be stopped at a fourth checkpoint on the fourth highway we used to get into the city, people started talking.  I have no idea what they were saying, but the tone was like, &ldquo;well, it looks like another checkpoint.&rdquo; and &ldquo;yeah; I wonder what we should do now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing like how I imagine I would have reacted, or how most Americans would react:  &ldquo;what??  Whaddya mean we can&rsquo;t go through????  This is the fourth !$!$!@$!@$!$ checkpoint and I&rsquo;ve got to get through and you can&rsquo;t stop us here and &hellip;.&rdquo; and so on.</p>

<p>But, eventually we did get through, ironically at a checkpoint I had been by before, but going the other direction.  It took 3 hours to get from the main checkpoint outside Nablus to the main checkpoint on that side of Jerusalem.  I was pretty angry at how long it had taken, so I walked through the metal detector with my keys, phone, wallet, belt.  It beeped, but I didn&rsquo;t stop.  And no one tried to stop me.</p>

<p>There were plenty of soldiers who could have at least <em>said</em> something.</p>

<p>The next day the newspaper headline read, The Palestinian Public Will Pay.  I argued that the headline &ldquo;the Palestinian public will pay&rdquo; <em>proves</em> that Palestine is unfairly treated. Sarah pointed out that the newspaper was not <em>condoning</em> the behavior, but predicting. I was like, &ldquo;I am glad to hear that, but my point remains.&rdquo; Palestine is under duress.</p>

<hr />

<p>Every Friday there is a demonstration near a village called Bil&rsquo;in, where a section of the separation barrier was being built.  In this case the barrier is a fence, with tracer roads as described above.  The barrier will separate Bil&rsquo;in villagers from 60% of their agricultural land.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the demonstrations have little or no effect on the construction.  The demonstration was described as a &ldquo;game&rdquo; by a man named Jason, who has been there taking pictures every week for some months.</p>

<p>I went to the Friday Demonstration in Bil&rsquo;in three times during my stay in the West Bank.  Two of those three times we encountered a flying checkpoint (temporary blockade) set up by soldiers on the road leading in to Bil&rsquo;in from Ramallah.  They said it was &ldquo;a closed military zone,&rdquo; and would not let anyone but residents or people with PRESS passes in.  Both times that my group was stopped at the checkpoint, we would turn around and go back about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> mile, then simply walk around the checkpoint.  One of those times we were able to get a ride with some locals once we had walked around the checkpoint.</p>

<p>Once we arrived in the village we found basically the same set of events each week:  Palestinian villagers from Bil&rsquo;in, along with Israelis and other internationals sympathetic to the Palestinian cause met around the mosque around noon.  With a different theme each week, the group would begin walking to the site of the fence construction.</p>

<p>Themes on days I was there:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Carrying large black &ldquo;snakes&rdquo; to represent the wall</p></li>

<li><p>Large scissors and cord to represent people being cut off from their land</p></li>

<li><p>Playground equipment to allow children to play in the demonstration area</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Villagers would chant in Arabic as they walked, and end up in a standoff with soldiers who would be waiting at the top of the hill where the road suddenly ends at the new fence-border.</p>

<p>The demonstration would be peaceful, and then invariably some Palestinian youth would throw rocks (using slingshots) at the soldiers as the demonstrators walked back home.  The soldiers would respond with tear gas and rubber bullets, the resulting melee sometimes resulting in hospitalization of demonstrators or rock throwers, but never the soldiers, who are well protected with armor and shields.</p>

<p>One of my friends was hit by a stone and had to be hospitalized for over a week as his spleen had been ruptured.  I personally was hit by a stone on my upper shoulder, thankfully where it did no damage.</p>

<p>One of the days some ISM volunteers arrived before the soldiers were prepared, and were able to lock themselves to the fence as soldiers drove up and begin pulling them off.  The locks were not very effective, but they looked good and perhaps got some good media attention.</p>

<p>Two people were hauled to the soldiers&rsquo; side of the fence and out of sight, but the rest were deposited on the Palestinian side, as gently as they heeded the soldiers&rsquo; attempts to move them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d guess about 8 activists had chained themselves, or attempted to chain themselves to the poles.  No injuries due to soldiers.</p>

<p>Other than that, it was the same game, and the fence was completed a few weeks later.</p>

<p>Staying in a hostel right across the street from the Old City meant we often visited the city for day to day activities.  One afternoon some of my new hostel friends and I did a self guided tour The Ramparts Walk around the Jerusalem Old City walls.  We took scads of pictures and had a lovely time.  The old city has many faces, and it&rsquo;s well worth the cost if one enjoys going for walks.</p>

<hr />

<p>Due to my upcoming planned travel to Brazil, I have to get a visa to enter the country.  I found it really difficult to get any assistance from the Brazilian embassy in Tel Aviv.  The clerk at the embassy seemed quite happy not to help me. His English was fine, but he looked at the documents I had brought and told me getting the visa was impossible.  He rattled off a list of things I would need, but didn&rsquo;t give me time to write them down.  I asked him for a written list of what I needed, and he said, &ldquo;I <em>told</em> you what you need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had to work carefully to keep my composure as I tried to explain I was unable to understand everything he had said.  Finally he gave me a list, and I looked over it while he helped other people.  I eventually determined I would need to present two documents that I simply didn&rsquo;t have:  proof of savings, and proof of income.</p>

<p>I thought the proof of savings was a bit ridiculous, for he would not tell me how much was enough.  I was told to just bring a bank statement and &ldquo;if they accept it, it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the end, I chose to apply for the visa in Japan, where there are apparently no such requirements.</p>

<hr />

<p>Eventually I decided I should pick olives, because that was my original reason for coming.  I went to Nablus to pick olives with Palestinian farmers, and got to stay in the ISM apartment in Balatta, the largest refugee camp in the West Bank. There is a common room, kitchen, bathroom, and two bedrooms.</p>

<p>The bedroom furniture consits of foam rubber mats, some of which have coverings. Stuff is tossed in various places, with a slight semblance of order, as some of the mats are up against the wall to get them out of the way during the day.</p>

<p>We are not allowed to use much water.  We should use sink-runoff to flush the toilet, and only take showers once every three days, &ldquo;if necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I climbed the wall 2 feet away from the back wall of this building. I stood on it and saw mostly buildings in various degrees of repair and construction, but no construction materials. Lots of TV antennaes and satellite dishes. A couple of lights and a mosque as well.</p>

<p>We had an orientation by Ayesh, who told us a lot of things about the history of Balatta, and some of the present events: there are military incursions every night and we must not go outside after midnight because we could get involved in a shooting from either the Israeli soldiers or the Palestinian fighters, neither of whom will be able to identify us as a friend.</p>

<p>I thought, &ldquo;Yikes stripes what kind of place am I in? I thought we were just going to go pick olives tomorrow. I thought the intifada was over.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>On the day we were to pick olives, Ayesh arranged for a taxi-van to take us to the location.  Because we could not use the settler road (*), the taxi driver couldn&rsquo;t take us all the way there, but drove through a small village and avoided an earthen road block by driving across a rough cracked dry red clay field with a smoldering pile of rubbish in one corner.</p>

<p>(*) highway that only military personnel and Jewish settlers can use.</p>

<p>He said we could walk the rest of the way across the field where we&rsquo;d be met by a man who would lead us to where he and his family were picking olives.  We piled out and immediately came across two cow carcasses, that seemed fairly intact except for the faces and tails.  One was in plain sight in the field, and another had fallen down a slope into a rather large ditch and mound that seems to have been dug across the middle of the fields.</p>

<p>Shortly, we were met by a man with a yellow hat and headed across a settler road, and met some people picking olives.</p>

<p>Just as we arrived, a military jeep raced up and stopped on the settler road near us, where two soldiers jumped out and ran toward the field where our taxi had been, and we heard what sounded a lot like a gunshot from that direction, and resounding echo from the surrounding hills.</p>

<p>(It turns out, according to the driver, the shot broke one of his side view mirrors.  He told us this as he came back to pick us up that evening. The right sideview mirror was broken, though I can&rsquo;t say I specifically saw it <em>not</em> broken in the morning, but I imagine I would have noticed.  Due to language barrier, we couldn&rsquo;t get the <em>reason</em> they shot at his van..)</p>

<p>The actual picking of olives involved a lot of climbing trees, and I loved it!  I kicked off my sandals and climbed barefoot.  Our instructions had been, &ldquo;pick everything and let it drop.&rdquo;  Tarps were set up below the trees to catch the olives.  They were all approximately the same color, greenish gray, but they were all a variety of sizes.</p>

<p>Near the end of the our picking day, our host offered to show us a grenade he had found half buried in the soil and covered with two rocks.  He thought perhaps it had been placed there as a land mine, for it had no pin.  We called B&rsquo;tselem, an organization with some clout and experience who would come out the next day to document the finding.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the second day of picking olives, we were invited to a different field, one where the farmers had been harassed by someone the day before.  These trees were basically on the other side of Salem, and across another well-paved road, under the surveillance of a lone watch tower.  There was no English speaking host this time, so Ayesh was our translator for the day.</p>

<p>We were not harassed by anyone, and once we had finished, we got a call on Ayesh&rsquo;s cellphone that there were people ready to deal with the grenade, so we had to get over there right away.  We walked across the rolling plains and village and dry field with rubbish and 2 cow carcasses to where we found soldiers talking next to some armored jeeps.  They had already discerned the location of the grenade and said we could not be here for its destruction.  Ayesh protested gently until we were told we could stay, but not record it.  Ultimately, we were told we could put our cameras on the jeep, but we had to stay behind the jeep during the detonation.</p>

<p>They counted down in Hebrew from 3, it exploded, Sarah squealed, we got it on video.</p>

<p>We were informed it was not a real grenade.</p>

<p>I semi-jestfully apologized for &ldquo;making them come out&rdquo; though the grenade was fake. One of the soldiers basically said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry; just doing our job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amazingly, none of us were asked to sign any papers, make any statements, or anything.  The soldiers simply packed up and left.  We inspected the small hole and dug for remains of the grenade, then left as well.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this should be a big deal.  There shouldn&rsquo;t be a nonchalant attitude about a grenade being found in a field.  They didn&rsquo;t ask us any questions; they didn&rsquo;t cordon off the area (except during their actual detonation); they didn&rsquo;t hunt for clues; they just came out, DESTROYED A GRENADE, and left.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible they asked the farmer who found the grenade, but it seems like they would want to get as much information as possible.  They didn&rsquo;t ask us anything, even after Ayesh was like, &ldquo;we found it!  we should be able to film it!&rdquo;</p>

<hr />

<p>On the last night of Ramadan, I walked home from Gyosei&rsquo;s  apartment.  It took 2 hours because I walked slowly and took an hour detour in the valley below the Mount of Olives.</p>

<p>Once I got around the corner of the old city, I started to walk past a traffic jam.  I passed fifty-one vehicles, all stuck in a last-night-of-Ramadan traffic jam.  The streets were brimming with happy people.  And trapped vehicles.</p>

<hr />

<p>One afternoon in early November, we heard several soundbomb explosions outside Damascus Gate in East Jerusalem.  We went outside to investigate, following where the soldiers had gone up Nablus Road. Video footage and images show a soundbomb thrown by Israeli Border Police into a street crowded with civilians.</p>

<p>A photo journalist confronts the commanding officer of the Israeli Border Police outside Damascus Gate.  A Hasidic Jew who said he was hit in the face with a stone expresses his concern and poses for photos.</p>

<p>These are the two writeups that we&rsquo;ll probably put on indymedia.com or some such.  I had no idea such a site existed, but Ed mentioned it and says we have enough evidence to make a court case against the soldier who threw the sound bomb.  I&rsquo;m not sure we have enough proof to say <em>who</em> it was that threw it, but certainly the video I got shows it thrown ridiculously close to little kids.</p>

<hr />

<p>Went on a tour of parts of the city with Ben et. al.  Nightmare stories of the insidious ways Palestinians are being cleansed from this region.  Near the end the tour leader was informed of a home demolition occuring nearby.  I was too distraught to go.  Ben, Juliet and Andrea went.  To varying degrees, they were distraught afterward.</p>

<p>The family&rsquo;s home was destroyed in front of their eyes.</p>

<p>Home demolitions happen weekly.  The basic story goes like this: they had no permit, so the house is illegal.  but they have been unable to obtain a permit because it is too expensive slash too impossible to get.</p>

<p>The Dead Sea was a fantastic final day-trip from Jerusalem.  After quite some confusion at the bus station as to which bus we should take, we finally got situated and headed out to En Gedi for 54.4 NIS per person.  There was a bit more confusion for us as to which En Gedi stop we should get off the bus, but in the end we chose En Gedi Beach, which seems to be the only free option.   There is a small shop with expensive food nearby, and a restroom which costs a few NIS to enter. Next time I will bring food.  We changed clothes down between the restroom and beach without a problem.</p>

<p>We spent a terrific afternoon swimming in the amazingly buoyant water. Ben learned that the water causes quite painful irritation when it got in his eyes, but was relatively easy to flush it out once I led him to the beach where Dave had a bottle of water. We gave ourselves a mud bath a little ways down the beach from the designated swimming area, and basically loved every minute of our excursion.</p>

<p>We even met a woman named Delphine who gave us an open invitation to visit her in Switzerland.</p>

<hr />

<p>Near the end of my stay, I got to talk to a guy who&rsquo;s both American and French and doing a documentary with some something something here in this crazy area.  Quite interesting to see how he was all shocked at the chaos of Qalandia, and I can remember being shocked at the chaos of Qalandia, but after 4 weeks here, I&rsquo;m over it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s messed up.  It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;ll leave this occupied territory and people will be like, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s it like?&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;meh; not a big deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in reality:  It&rsquo;s shocking.</p>

<hr />

<p>Only my truly final last full day in the area, I was driven to Bethlehem by my friend Niveen.  She wanted to give me a tour of her old school and the Church of the Nativity.</p>

<p>She was shocked and distraught to find a new checkpoint where she used to just drive through to the city.  We were unable to get her car through, but we were able to walk through, after a great deal of begging by Niveen, and my act of indignant American tourist who couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to stop at the checkpoint.</p>

<p>Once we were in the city, everything was fine, save that we had to walk a lot more than expected, and pay for taxis to go the bulk of the way to and from the city center.  We met some of her professors at her school and took pictures around the area.  Niveen was quite happy when she wasn&rsquo;t thinking about the new checkpoint.  I enjoyed seeing her old stomping grounds and getting a sense of what her school was like.  It&rsquo;s situated on a hill as a clump of buildings with some grass and trees between them.  Unless there is a whole section I didn&rsquo;t see, the entire campus covers just a handful of acres.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the way back through the checkpoint, I was astonished that all the passengers on tour buses had to get OUT of the tour bus, wait in the brand spanking new cattle herding facility, then get back ON the tour bus, for a grand total of moving about 100 yards in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>We waited in line, chatting with several other Americans who were on a tour, and marveled at the facility.  It&rsquo;s literally like going between countries, not between cities.  I stood in line with Niveen, whereas passport holders could just show their passport and walk through a gate (so I don&rsquo;t know what was taking so long at first).  In a non-violent act against the facility, I tried to walk through the gate, found it locked, so I jumped over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned around after a couple of &ldquo;heys&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo; like &ldquo;who are you to talk to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guy was like &ldquo;where&rsquo;s your passport?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked him in the eyes.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way am I showing you my passport.  My taxes <em>paid</em> for this facility (*)&rdquo; I glared into his eyes until he grabbed my arm as if to show me who was boss.</p>

<p>I pulled away and was like, &ldquo;alright, look,&rdquo; and showed him my passport.  He took it, then began to walk away, and I tried to snatch it back from him and then pulled his arm and he looked back at me like, &ldquo;are you daring to challenge my authority?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I backed off and he gave my passport to the guy behind the glass.</p>

<p>I said something like, &ldquo;this is ridiculous; there&rsquo;s no reason to make these people wait here; this is completely preposterous,&rdquo; by which time my passport was checked and put back under the glass where the guy I had challenged motioned toward it with his head, ignoring everything I said.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure I would not have done it had there <em>not</em> been about 50 American tourists there watching everything.  I basically just wanted to make a scene and get across the point that the checkpoint makes people resentful.</p>

<p>It was definitely a situation after which I thought of several things I could have said better than at the moment.</p>

<p>It turns out this is a brand new facility that opened yesterday according to my friend Sarah who has been going to and from Bethlehem almost every day during her stay in Jerusalem.</p>

<p><a href="https://robnugen.com/images/travel/Palestine/2005_olive_harvest/New_Bethlehem_checkpoint/702rampart_soldier_at_new_Bethlehem_checkpoint.jpg">new checkpoint</a></p>

<hr />

<p>I had heard many stories about the difficulties I could face when leaving the country.  I had heard the aiport security often tried to retain people&rsquo;s computers for security purposes, saying the computer will be sent on later.</p>

<p>I was prepared to cite my rights that they could <em>not</em> keep my computer, but they never told me they needed to keep it, and though they didn&rsquo;t treat it with the gentle touch that I do, it still works fine.  They did, however, try to log me out, but gave up when a bunch of dialog boxes came up.</p>

<p>At one point, they asked me, &ldquo;where is the camera?&rdquo; which I assume means they assumed I had a camera.  I pulled it out of my pocket and they inspected it, turned it on, pushed a lot of buttons, and took a picture with it.  They asked to see my cellphone, and I promptly gave them the one I have from Japan, having given the one I borrowed from Niveen back to her, and they asked me if I could speak Japanese and &ldquo;knew what all these symbols meant&rdquo; on the face of the phone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.  They are Japanese characters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not strip searched, but I did have to leave my luggage in their care as I was carefully searched with a metal detector.  They X-rayed my jacket (with Francois in the pocket) and hat and little tiny padded Japanese good luck charm thing when its metalic embroidered thread triggered the metal detector.  I think they X-rayed my shoes, too, because the rivets in the back made the thing beep.</p>

<p>When I got my jacked back, Francois was in the <em>other</em> pocket, but he seem unscathed.</p>

<p>About 5 people asked me why I came and who I saw and where I went.  I told them I took pictures in Bil&rsquo;in and helped with the olive harvest in Nablus.  They asked why I came now [this time of year?] and I explained the olives are ripe at this time of year.</p>

<p>Once I got back to my luggage after the non-strip search, I found they had packed my pillow very well in one side of the bag, but the other side with all my clothes and stuff was quite a mess.  I asked them if I could help, and the guy was like, &ldquo;sure; you can do it yourself if you like.&rdquo; I asked what time it was and if I had enough time for my flight, and he said yes.</p>

<p>Though they asked for my consent first, they opened the brand new bottle of olive oil that I had bought last night as a souvenir, but consented to put an &ldquo;official&rdquo; sticker on it to explain to the recipient why it was no longer sealed.  The sticker was just a barcode something used to identify luggage wrapped around the top of the bottle.</p>

<p>After they were satisfied that I was safe to board a plane, I was led by a guy with all my stuff to the airline check-in counter, where they request proof that I live in Japan or proof of onward travel from Japan.  This was more proof than I was actually required to show in Japan.</p>

<hr />

<p>In all, my experience confirmed the stories I had heard about living conditions there, and showed me how people could get used to anything, and just continue to live as best they can.  I have been so privileged to live in great ignorance of the horrors around the world.  I&rsquo;m glad to have begun opening my eyes to what&rsquo;s going on&hellip;</p>

<p>The reasons behind the scenes are so ingrained, so intermeshed; I&rsquo;ve found it nearly impossible to imagine a solution, but education could be a first step.</p>

passport control without having to submit to Israeli security checks,

<p>Reading the headline news on Rafah Crossing one would conclude that Palestinians are free to come and go as they please with minimal control by Israel over Gaza in general, nothing significantly impeding them from creating a prosperous economy, controlling their borders, air space and sea ports.  The AP news wire with such titles as &ldquo;Palestinians zip across border&rdquo; and &ldquo;Speedy passage from Gaza&rdquo; conjure up images of anyone being able to leave Gaza as they please, with a snap of their fingers.</p>

<p>At the ceremony held at the crossing last Friday, Nov. 25th, Abbas stated &ldquo;I think every Palestinian now has his passport ready in his pocket; let them come to cross at this terminal whenever they want,&rdquo;.  Despite the opening of the crossing and the majority of control being handed over to the PA, Egypt and the EU, stating that Rafah crossing is open for all to come and go freely is misleading.</p>

<p>Talking to people in Rafah I get the impression that the feeling on the street is not necessarily reflected in the statements of Abbas and other officials.  &ldquo;Sure I can cross&rdquo; they tell me, &ldquo;If I had a visa&rdquo;.  Men between the ages of 15-55 cannot cross without one.  Or I hear &ldquo;If I had a passport I could pass&rdquo;.  Men over the age of 55 must have this ID to legitimize their passage.  Not only is the bureaucracy to obtain these documents astounding, taking anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months, but it costs more money then most people here can afford to fork over.</p>

<p>Abu K has been talking for weeks now about finally being able to visit his parents in Egypt, he has not seen them since the Intifada broke out.  We have gone with him, visiting various governmental offices and a lawyer as he attempts to renew his ID card.  This process is slow, weighted down with bureaucracy.  It could take him up to 3 months before he gets approval.  At the same time he has been hoping that his parents would be able to come visit him in Rafah with the opening of the crossing.  He kept saying, &ldquo;I will see my parents soon Insha&rsquo;allah&rdquo;.   As the crossing officially opened he learned that his parents will have to obtain passports, beyond the ID they already hold.  This process as well can take up to 3 months.  His hopes of seeing them, like those of so many others rose with the hype of Rafah crossing opening.  Time and time again the rhetoric does not materialize, the reality of everyday life does not change.</p>

<p>Another friend, Ahmed, has t-shirts of Rachel Corrie and Tom Hurndall that need to be mailed to the states.  Mailing anything in and out of Gaza is extremely unreliable, exemplifying the occupation of Gaza in its current form.  Ahmed is my age, 24, meaning he needs a visa issued by the PA before being able to cross in to Egypt.  Again visas not only take months to process, particularly now as hundreds of people are applying for them, they are also extremely expensive, limiting access even more so to those who&rsquo;s income is above average, or those who patiently save enough to buy their way through.  Ahmed&rsquo;s strategy is to send his father who is over 55, thus not needing a visa, merely a valid passport, to mail them from Egypt.</p>

<p>We attended the private ceremony of the opening of the crossing.   Being that we are here in Rafah we decided to see if it was all that it was cracked up to be.  As we drove toward the crossing the road was lined with Palestinian security guards, after all it was a ceremony for government officials, foreign dignitaries and politicians.  When we arrived at the first gate there was no shortage of people crowded outside trying to enter.  Those with press passes were allowed to pass through freely, as were the fancy cars carrying men in suits, businessmen, and politicians. We pushed our way through the crowd Rochelle and I and two Palestinian friends, Ahmed and Mahmoud.  Standing in the midst of the crowd we waited not knowing what was happening.  Mahmoud called to us and the next thing we knew security guards were ushering us through the gate.  On the inside of the gate Palestinian police and military personnel dressed in blue fatigue swarmed the area.  We began walking and were quickly escorted into a van with other journalists.  Wondering how we made it in passed all the security I had the suspicion that being two white women carrying video equipment may have had something to do with it.  Mahmoud later confirmed this was true.  He told the security guards that he was escorting two journalists.  This gave us a good laugh, but also clearly exemplified the power we hold as Americans here.  Had Mahmoud and Ahmed attempted to come to the ceremony alone they would still be waiting outside the gate. Staring through the barbed wire fence while those who represent them pass by without a glance in the direction of the people they speak for.</p>

<p>Just entering this ceremony the division between the people and the politicians was starkly clear.  Hearing Abbas tell the 1,500 guests &ldquo;Now every one of you can submit your passport and cross freely with no limitations,&rdquo; I thought, yeah, everyone here at the ceremony can do that, what about those watching from the other side of the barbed wire fence surrounding us, isolating the people from those representing them on the world stage.</p>

<p>I never held the illusion that the Palestinian Authority represented completely the will and voice of the Palestinian people, just as I know the American government does not represent the will and voice of the American people.  What I witnessed there solidified in my mind the kind of lives politician lead, shuttled from one place to another, constantly surrounded by armed guards, isolated from society.  It makes it difficult to see how they could ever fully know the peoples needs or understand their dreams and hopes for the future enough to implement changes that will benefit the people who know suffering they can only imagine.</p>

<p>I realize this is harsh.  People may disagree but what I experienced at this media stunt, men in suits surrounded by international media, Palestinian and Egyptian politicians thanking Condoleezza Rice, thanking Israel. The Egyptian Intelligence Minister Omar Suleiman, and the European Union special envoy to the Middle East peace process, Mark Otte calling this a new era and Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) summing it all up as a historic day left me feeling empty.  The hollowness of their words we have all heard before, watched it on TV.  This was simply first time I heard it standing on a red carpet filming Abu Mazen while Palestinians who live on this border, whoâs flesh and blood know the pain and fear of this military occupation are made to stand outside this ceremony and listen while others portray their lifeâs through political rhetoric.  I believe equality and peace will not be borne out of this hierarchical power structure by which we live.  Peace requires the creativity of us all to dream up a system of equality and sustainability, for the benefit of everyone, not simply a few.</p>

<p>I recognize the limited ability the PA has to make positive change.  I understand the pressure from the US and Israel, the demands they make in return for any concessions to the PA.  This is not a black and white situation, I am just beginning to understand  the complexity of it all. Day by day I gain insight into the intricacies of internal Palestinian politics.</p>

<p>We spent Saturday interviewing adults and children asking them to talk about their lives under occupation, their thoughts on the disengagement, their hopes and dreams for the future, etc.  They shared with us the pain and suffering they have experienced and still experience. As I sat, listening and watching I could see so clearly the trauma everyone here lives with.  Their voices were strong but watching their eyes and their shaking hands I knew they were re-living experiences I could never understand and things they can never forget.</p>

<p>As I sit here thinking of all the dignitaries and politicians fenced off from the community around them, deciding the fate of millions of people, thinking about the stories I have heard of explosions in the night, the constant gunfire, refusing to leave ones home despite the danger of staying I can&rsquo;t help but feel they are two different worlds.  I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if we, ordinary people, took our fate into our own hands, beyond the control of governments what we would create.  Surely, having experienced the horrors of war, the pain life brings, we would come together and find someway more successful then all the peace processes, accords and summits held to &ldquo;win the peace&rdquo; as Bush so elegantly puts it. Being here, getting to know people, hearing their stories and sharing them with you all I feel a part of this process of change, this resistance, and knowing this is taking place all over the world I can still find faith in humanity despite the atrocities we are capable of committing.</p>

                        <p>##19:02 Sunday 20 November 2005</p>

<p>Hello world!</p>

<p>In the past couple weeks, I&rsquo;ve witnessed two and a half particularly interesting things.</p>

<p>1) One was the anti-climatic detonation of what turned out to be a fake grenade found by a Palestinian farmer near the olive trees we were helping him harvest.</p>

<p>He showed us the grenade, which looked real enough to warrant concern.  It had been partially buried with its pin removed, and two stones covering it.  The farmer thought the grenade may be live, planted as a landmine of sorts.</p>

<p>We called the Israeli Defense Force, who sent a couple of armored jeeps out the next day.  The soldiers placed a charge near the grenade with the intent of detonating the grenade via their remotely detonated charge.  We hid behind one of the jeeps when the charge was detonated.</p>

<p>A quick BAM, and some smoke; it was over.  The grenade had been a fake, they said.</p>

<p>I semi-jestfully apologized for &ldquo;making them come out&rdquo; though the grenade was fake.  One of the soldiers basically said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry; just doing our job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of us had to sign any papers, make any statements, or anything.  The soldiers packed up and left.  We inspected the small hole and dug for remains of the grenade, then left as well.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this should be a big deal.  There shouldn&rsquo;t be a nonchalant attitude about a grenade being found in a field.  They didn&rsquo;t ask us any questions; they didn&rsquo;t cordon off the area (except during their actual detonation); they didn&rsquo;t hunt for clues; they just came out, DESTROYED A GRENADE, and left.</p>

<p>There is a video of the detonation at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?v=xr3H_AlHPhU">https://www.youtube.com/?v=xr3H_AlHPhU</a>, and on my website with some pictures from the day at <a href="https://robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&date;=2005/10/31#Today">https://robnugen.com/cgi-local/journal.pl?type=all&date;=2005/10/31#Today</a></p>

<p>2) The second interesting thing happened quite close to the hostel where I&rsquo;m staying in Jerusalem.  Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not unusual that we hear soundbombs used near Damascus Gate, which is visible from the hostel&rsquo;s lounge window.  Soundbombs are not &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; per se, but the Israeli border police and soldiers use them to disperse crowds.</p>

<p>We heard a quick succession of perhaps 8 soundbombs, which sent several of us outside with video cameras to see what we could record.</p>

<p>I thought everything was over (I went out rather later than the others) when one last soundbomb was thrown.  I can only imagine the soldier who threw it must have been in an adrenaline-filled state, and not thinking clearly.  It landed quite near 4 or 5 young girls who had been walking up the road in a carefree way.</p>

<p>The video I took is here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?v=LVVGTnaNZns">https://www.youtube.com/?v=LVVGTnaNZns</a></p>

<p>Afterward, my friend David confronted someone who seemed to be in charge of the action, saying it was inappropriate to throw soundbombs so close to innocents.  This man angrily replied that rocks had been thrown at an innocent Jewish man, and that we Political Activists were only showing one side of the story; why weren&rsquo;t we videoing the Jew who had been hurt?</p>

<p>As I recorded David talking to the Jewish man (who had a bit of blood on his nose, not really visible in the video), the angry soldier yelled at me, but I didn&rsquo;t respond.</p>

<p>Here is the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?v=0vzUttSNzvU">https://www.youtube.com/?v=0vzUttSNzvU</a></p>

<p>3) The third thing happened yesterday.  I saw it from afar, but couldn&rsquo;t make myself go; it felt too dangerous.  A Palestinian family&rsquo;s house was being demolished for &ldquo;security reasons,&rdquo; according to the soldier who was asked.  The family had been given 24 hours notice.</p>

<p>My friends Juliet and Ben went to see what has happening.  Juliet had stones thrown at her by Palestinian kids when she was near the soldiers.  The video Juliet took features the wife wailing-crying-screaming at her life being destroyed before her eyes.  The Arab speakers here said she was blaming Ariel Sharon and others for her plight.  Juliet didn&rsquo;t record the husband screaming angrily at her, though people on the scene said he was yelling, &ldquo;why couldn&rsquo;t you come earlier?  Why are you here now [that it&rsquo;s too late]?  Why didn&rsquo;t you stop this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben wrote</p>

<p>Last Monday I went on a tour of East Jerusalem with an Israeli
Jewish group called ICAHD (Israeli Committee Against Housing
Demolitions).  On the way home our guide received a text alert on
his phone about a house demolition in the West Bank town of Anata
that was about to occur.  We could see from the highway across the
valley two large excavators with hydraulic hammer attachments
surrounded by soldiers pushing back a crowd.  We couldn&rsquo;t tell
which building it was that was going to be demolished.  Only three
of us were willing to go and witness this, so we were dropped off
up the highway at the entrance to the town and rushed to the site
where the demolition was already under way.  There were 20-30
children on the road, some throwing stones at the soldiers
standing guard, a hundred Palestinians with soldiers blocking them
encircling the entire site, and just as many on rooftops.  I split
up from the other two and headed to the uphill side of the
building to get a good perspective.* It was a three story
apartment building and it took about an hour for the machines to
knock the whole thing down.</p>

<p>The two excavators made a terrible noise as the two hydraulic
hammers slammed the concrete and sections of the floor suddenly
gave way.  As it started to get dark I decided it would be a good
idea to get home, and as I walked back through the streets it
occurred to me that the three of us were the only internationals
I&rsquo;d seen.  It seems to me now that one advantage to the
authorities of not issuing warning of the demolition is that this
most likely prevents any international media from being there.
And there wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t go; it sounds really traumatizing.</p>

<p>4) After my last email, I got a few replies that asked some of the same questions.</p>

<p>*) I forgot to specify that a stone had hit me, not a rubber bullet.</p>

<p>*) I described Palestine as &ldquo;a country basically surrounded by Israel.&rdquo;  A better description would be &ldquo;Occupied Territories of Palestine,&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s not a country as such, and it&rsquo;s not surrounded.</p>

<p>5) Over the past two days I have been practicing peace within myself via meditation, reading (<em>Life of Pi</em>), writing, and folding origami.  I&rsquo;ve been releasing the ingrained ideas that I need to be &ldquo;doing something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>6) However, yesterday, Ben, Dave and I went to the Dead Sea and had a fantastic time!  We went to En Gedi Beach, which is free (except for transportation out there) if one brings food.  We delighted in the incredible buoyancy and decided we could easily swim to Jordan.  If we became tired on the way, we could simply rest, floating effortlessly with our heads well out of the water.</p>

<p>After our swim, we met a woman named Delphine from Switzerland and chatted with her while I let the water dry on my skin, leaving a layer of salt crystals on my shoulder and some in my beard.  (I haven&rsquo;t shaved since I left Japan on 6 October.)  We decided to take a mud bath, and turned ourselves into mud versions of The Fantastic Four, or a dark hue of Blue Man Group.  I debated letting Francois (my stuffed rabbit) get coated, but didn&rsquo;t want to risk having him rot if I couldn&rsquo;t wash all the mud out.</p>

<p>Several pictures from Dead Sea and a longer version of the story are here:

<p>7) Just tonight, I went to Bethlehem with my friend Niveen!!  We had some problems getting through the new checkpoint, a brand new facility that opened yesterday according to my friend Sarah who has been going to and from Bethlehem almost every day during her stay in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Niveen was disallowed to drive through, causing her great consternation and a U-turn with no idea how we could get in.  We jumped onto a servis (group taxi), hoping they could get through.  Actually they could not, but dropped us off at the walk-in gate, outside a brand new facility that looks a lot like a modernized cattle-herding hanger.  We were monitored by soldiers on ramparts, blocked by rotating gates (that were remotely locked after a few people went through), required to show our IDs to people behind thick (bullet proof?) glass, where Niveen (and all other Palestinians) will have their IDs entered into a computer.</p>

<p>There were several people in line, and one guy said he knew a shortcut, which turned out to be walking through the drive-through gate where we had been stopped before.  I just walked through without acknowledging the guards until they used English and Niveen called my name.  I still didn&rsquo;t show them my ID but stood there &ldquo;impatiently&rdquo; waiting for Niveen who pleaded her case until finally we were waived through.</p>

<p>We walked through the massive gate in the wall (big enough for tour buses) and quickly found a servis to take us to Bethlehem University (where Niveen went to school).  We saw some of her friends (and one of mine!) and then visited the Church of the Nativity, where I got a picture of Francois on the site where Jesus is said to have been born.</p>

<p>This was all great and fantastic and I was really happy to get this crown jewel of a Francois photo (though Sarah says I should have put him <em>in</em> the hole) before I left for home.</p>

<p>On the way back through the checkpoint, I was astonished that all the passengers on tour buses had to get OUT of the tour bus, wait in the spanking new cattle herding facility, then get back ON the tour bus, for a grand total of moving about 100 yards in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>We waited in line, chatting with several other Americans who were on a tour, and marveled at the facility.  It&rsquo;s literally like going between countries, not between cities.  I stood in line with Niveen, whereas passport holders could just show their passport and walk through a gate (so I don&rsquo;t know what was taking so long at first).  In a non-violent act against the facility, I tried to walk through the gate, found it locked, so I jumped over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned around after a couple of &ldquo;heys&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;what?&rdquo; like &ldquo;who are you to talk to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guy was like &ldquo;where&rsquo;s your passport?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked him in the eyes.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way am I showing you my passport.  My taxes <em>paid</em> for this facility (*)&rdquo; I glared into his eyes until he grabbed my arm as if to show me who was boss.</p>

<p>I pulled away and was like, &ldquo;alright, look,&rdquo; and showed him my passport.  He took it and I tried to snatch it back from him and then pulled his arm and he looked back at me like, &ldquo;are you daring to challenge my authority?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I backed off and he gave my passport to the guy behind the glass.</p>

<p>I said something like, &ldquo;this is ridiculous; there&rsquo;s no reason to make these people wait here; this is completely preposterous,&rdquo; by which time my passport was checked and put back under the glass where the guy I had challenged motioned toward it with his head, ignoring everything I said.</p>

<p>This is definitely a situation after which I thought of several things I could have said better at the moment.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure I would not have done it had there <em>not</em> been about 50 American tourists there watching everything.  I basically just wanted to make a scene and get across the point that the checkpoint makes people resentful.</p>

<p>Pictures are on this page, though not (yet) well labeled:

<p>(*) strictly speaking I can&rsquo;t prove this is true, but I know the US gives money to Israel.</p>

<p>8) I&rsquo;ll be leaving this area on the 17th, and back in Japan the next day.</p>

<p>Love and Blessings to All!

                        <p>##04:53 Saturday 29 October 2005</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to write a few lines about what I&rsquo;ve seen in the West Bank, though I have not actually picked olives yet.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this will be a long message, so I&rsquo;m going to write it in sections, and may follow up with other sections soon.</p>

<p>=======================
Section One: Vocabulary</p>

<p>When I first arrived here, I did not know the meaning / differences between &ldquo;West Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gaza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following are my definitions, and people may disagree with them.</p>

<p>Israel: a small country between the Mediterranean Sea on the west and Jordan on the east.</p>

<p>Palestine: an even smaller country that is basically surrounded by Israel.  Palestine is basically separated into two parts.  The parts are &ldquo;West Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gaza&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Gaza Strip&rdquo;).</p>

<p>West Bank: the larger section of Palestine, which is on the west bank of the Jordan river.  Hence the name, I believe.</p>

<p>Gaza: the smaller section of Palestine, on the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>Occupation: Israeli soldiers with M-16 (?) machine guns are ever-present in Palestine streets (and possibly Israel, but I haven&rsquo;t been there).  In my experience, they are generally quiet, but will answer questions if I ask.  Often they say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I&rsquo;m not from this area.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Checkpoints: Blockade or toll-plaza type places in the streets and highways where traffic is stopped and checked by Israeli soldiers. Some checkpoints completely disallow vehicular traffic from passing. (*) see Qalandia Checkpoint below.</p>

<p>Flying Checkpoints: same as checkpoints, but erected on the whim of the Israeli army.  I have seen these on highways, on sidewalks, on city streets.</p>

<p>Settlers: Israeli citizens who (often for financial reasons) are given housing from the Israeli government.  They are placed in areas that would otherwise be called Palestine (according to my definition above).  I have not met any settlers, but have heard some horrific stories of unchecked settler aggression toward Palestinians and Internationals.</p>

<p>Internationals: people who are not from Israel or Palestine, but who would like to help stop the occupation of Palestine.</p>

<p>Olive Harvest: &lsquo;tis the season farmers pick olives from trees. Sometimes settlers challenge Palestinian farmers for rights to the land.  When Internationals are present with video cameras, settlers seem less likely to be violent.</p>

<p>Refugee Camps: poor, cramped cities where displaced Palestinians have been moved when Israel was formed, or more recently as Israel has grown into previously Palestinian areas.</p>

<p>Apartheid: unequal application of rules / laws to racially separate people.  From South Africa, but has been used to describe the situation in Israel/Palestine.</p>

<p>Security Fence:
Separation Barrier:
Apartheid Wall:  a fence / wall 8 meters tall being constructed around Palestine.</p>

<p>further reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid_wall">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid_wall</a></p>

<p>Intifada: An uprising of Palestinians against the apartheid in which they have been living.  The first Intifada was from 1987 to 1992ish. The second Intifada started in 2000, and is or is not finished depending on who one asks.</p>

<p>=================================
Section Two:  Qalandia Checkpoint</p>

<p>I have been living in Faisal Hostel in Jerusalem.  It&rsquo;s near the Old City of Jerusalem, where Jesus carried the cross before his crucifixion back in the day.</p>

<p>Ramallah is a city about 18 kilometers (11 miles) north of Jerusalem. Ramallah means hill of God.</p>

<p>There is a highway between Ramallah and Jerusalem, which would make the trip take about 15 minutes by car.</p>

<p>However, there is a checkpoint on the highway, through which vehicles may not pass.</p>

<p>To go from Jerusalem to Ramallah, everyone must get out of the vehicle (taxi or bus, unless someone has a friend to drive their personal car away) walk 100 meters past guards and through a one way gate, then secure another vehicle to go the remaining 5 minutes to Ramallah.</p>

<p>To get from Ramallah to Jerusalem, everyone must get out of the vehicle, walk 50 meters, go through a one way gate, through a metal detector, show passport or ID to the soldiers, and then the remaining 50 meters to secure another vehicle on the other side.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s called Qalandia Checkpoint, and rumor has suggested the security could get even tighter on the way from Jerusalem to Ramallah.</p>

<p>==================
Section Three: ISM</p>

<p>ISM stands for International Solidarity Movement.  Their basic idea involves having Internationals come to Palestine to stand with Palestinians during the riotous Intifada.  Because the Intifada is no longer riotous, and many &ldquo;hard core&rdquo; ISMers have been blacklisted and cannot return to the country, ISM will reformulate itself after this year&rsquo;s olive harvest.</p>

<p>I came to Palestine with the intention of joining other ISMers in supporting the olive harvest.  At the training, I was surprised at the content of the training.  We spent a great deal of time on topics like protecting ourselves from tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound bombs. We did role plays of de-arresting people by dogpiling a person the soldiers are trying to arrest.  We spent a great deal of time learning about our rights and about the chances of being arrested, what to expect, and what to do in case we are arrested.</p>

<p>At the end, we came to the final question: &ldquo;okay, where do you want to go harvest olives?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I decided I was not ready to put myself into a situation where I might be arrested.  More specifically, I didn&rsquo;t want to be deported without the chance of return.</p>

<p>================================
Section Four: Palestinian Vision</p>

<p>Instead of being an Activist, I have focused on being a writer.  Part of that time has been writing and editing reports and grant requests for Palestinian Vision, an NGO that focuses on empowering Palestinian Youth to help them focus on living instead of being oppressed.</p>

<p>I learned of PalVision semi-directly from my voyage on Peace Boat. Niveen and Eilat were selected by PalVision to sail on Peace Boat and represent youth voices in this conflict.  Niveen&rsquo;s passionate story brought me to Palestine to see for myself what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>====================
Section Five: Bil&rsquo;in</p>

<p>Residents of a village called Bil&rsquo;in gather every Friday (the first day of their weekend) to peacefully protest construction of a wall that (once completed) will separate the village from 60% of its farmland, which will be given to the nearby Israeli settlement.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been to this demonstration twice, not as an active participant, but as a photographer and videographer.  Each week, approximately the same thing happened: soldiers stood in full riot gear at the top of a hill while villagers and at least as many internationals chanted in Arabic and held signs.  I was one of many recording the event, basically ignored by everyone involved.</p>

<p>After the chanting, the demonstration splits up into people who go home, and people who spread out over the land.  The soldiers spread out with them.  Some people (who may be a villagers or may be Israeli sympathetic and trying to stir up trouble) throw rocks at the soldiers who wait for a bit and then shoot rubber bullets and tear gas at the rock throwers.</p>

<p>The first time I attended (two weeks ago), I tried to stay well away from the conflict, but at one point found myself right in the middle of it!  Unfortunately with dead batteries in both my still camera and video camera because I had recorded so much other stuff.  I wasn&rsquo;t hit by anything, but I did get a couple long moments with tear gas.</p>

<p>The second time I attended (last week), I recorded some of the action, and then honestly got rather bored and just sat near the top of the hill near where some soldiers were standing around waiting for instruction.</p>

<p>Suddenly, <em>!<em>WHAM</em>!</em> I felt a shocking blow on my shoulder!  It was more surprising than painful, but had it hit <em>anywhere</em> else on my body, it would have produced serious pain and likely injury.  It struck exactly on the muscle between my neck and shoulder.  Truly thankful, truly blessed, I thanked my angels for the easy lesson.</p>

<p>(it was a stone)</p>

<p>Several soldiers came to ask if I was okay; I assured everyone I was fine.</p>

<p>The week before, a man named Joe was hit by a stone in the stomach. Palestinian doctors repaired his spleen and stapled the incision shut on his abdomen.  He is sitting across from me and showed everyone his scar - about five inches long.</p>

<p>====================</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s enough for one installment.  Blessings and love to all.</p>

                        <p>##05:10 Sunday 09 October 2005</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in Jerusalem!</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t really seen anything undeniably inappropriate, but there is definitely a distinction between areas for Palestinians and  areas for Israelis, and definitely some weird stuff going on.</p>

<p>For the past two days, I&rsquo;ve been staying in Faisal Hostel, basically across the street from Damascus Gate, a portal between the Old City of Jerusalem, and the rest of Jerusalem.  The Old City is where a lot of biblical stories took place, including where Jesus was tortured and paraded through town, if I understand correctly.</p>

<p>Twice I&rsquo;ve wandered around the Old City, which seems a lot like the world&rsquo;s original shopping mall, but with churches and people with machine guns keeping us in line.</p>

<p>Once I wandered around a market in an Israeli area of town, where I was surprised to see a significant number of civilians with guns tucked into their belts.  What type of bizarro world have I reached??</p>

<p>This month the muslims are celebrating Ramadan, and last night the Israeli soldiers were 2500 strong around the Old City, controlling entrance where people were trying to go pray.  At one point the soldiers launched sound bombs to disperse the crowd that had collected near Damascus Gate.   The Palestinians hadn&rsquo;t been doing anything violent.  I had just been out there getting some food.</p>

<p>Today my friend Niveen (from Peace Boat) came to visit, and gave me her old cell phone!  She took me to get a simcard and then to the Palestinian Vision office where I met Ramy, the Middle East Coordinator for Peace Boat!  He speaks 100 miles per hour and invited me to come by anytime I&rsquo;d like to help with writing or editing.  Fantastic numbers of doors are opening for me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll stick with my original plan for now; I&rsquo;m going to be trained tomorrow and the next day by people from ISM before participating in the olive harvest.  Ramy assured me that 1 month is far too long for me to pick olives every day, and said I&rsquo;d be welcome back whenever I was done picking olives.</p>

<p>So so much to learn; so many people I&rsquo;ll be meeting tomorrow!</p>
