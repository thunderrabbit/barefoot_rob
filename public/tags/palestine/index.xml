Save Jerusalem from the Apartheid Wall and Ethnic cleansing
 In an attempt to disrupt this unity among Palestinians on both sides of the Armistice Line, the Wall has been built right down the middle of the village, separating families and neighbors, shopkeepers and customers from their markets, people from their work, and children from their schools. 216 shops and houses have been demolished close to where the Wall has been built.</description>

This was actually sent to me a long time ago, but I&amp;rsquo;m just now getting it posted
 Hi All, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while I know! Partly my lack of emails is because i&amp;rsquo;m not very good at keeping in touch (as pointed out very clearly by my sister last week!) and partly because I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I had that much to report. I&amp;rsquo;m settled here now and my life has it&amp;rsquo;s routine just like it did in the UK.</description>

I think I&amp;rsquo;m losing it&amp;hellip;seriously&amp;hellip;i think I&amp;rsquo;m forgetting the meaning of words like &amp;ldquo;peace&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;ceasefire&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;routine&amp;rdquo;. Today I had a day off and went to meet a friend of mine from Bethlehem who has recently started a new job with UNESCO in Ramallah. We met for a long lunch and then went shopping in Ramallah&amp;rsquo;s busy town centre. Then the army arrived. Bulldozers first, shunting parked cars out of the way, some into shop fronts.</description>

Hi everyone, It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last mass email and I&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple of those &amp;ldquo;are you still alive&amp;rdquo; emails that I love as they prove to me that you all miss me (ie they&amp;rsquo;re good for my ego!) and make me laugh! I have to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing this email a few times, but every time I&amp;rsquo;ve given up as the words seemed a little empty.</description>

By now you may be aware that I am in Jerusalem with the four other delegates from the Olympia-Rafah Sister City Project, and Cindy and Craig Corrie. We chose to leave Gaza Wednesday morning after two men came to our apartment late Tuesday night asking us to go with them under the false pretense that we would be safer staying in their home. Our host in Rafah recognized this as an attempt to kidnap us and cautiously navigated the situation resulting in the bizarre scenario of the men shaking each of our hands and leaving.</description>

      <description>##11:35 Friday 16 December 2005
I have been agonizing over this document for weeks. My basic task is to write about my experiences in the occupied territories of Palestine, but I find it impossible to actually put to paper anything that could get across the idea of the reality there.
My friends have asked me questions, and I find the answers difficult because I have to keep &amp;ldquo;backing up&amp;rdquo; to give context before anything can make sense.</description>

Below (save for the AP quote) was written by Serena, serene@riseup.net
 RAFAH TERMINAL, Gaza Strip - It was a smooth debut Saturday for the first Palestinian-run border crossing. Hundreds of travelers zipped through passport control without having to submit to Israeli security checks, savoring their new freedom after 38 years of military occupation.
  (Written [27 November 2005 By Ibrahim Barzak, Associated Press](https://www.google.com/custom?domains=robnugen.com&amp;amp;q=%22Palestinian-run+border+crossing.+Hundreds+of+travelers%22&amp;amp;sa=Search&amp;amp;sitesearch=&amp;amp;client=pub-8968158139273573&amp;amp;forid=1&amp;amp;channel=5817411192&amp;amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;amp;cof=GALT%3A%23008000%3BGL%3A1%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3BVLC%3A663399%3BAH%3Acenter%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BLBGC%3A336699%3BALC%3A0000FF%3BLC%3A0000FF%3BT%3A000000%3BGFNT%3A0000FF%3BGIMP%3A0000FF%3BFORID%3A1%3B&amp;amp;hl=en))  Reading the headline news on Rafah Crossing one would conclude that Palestinians are free to come and go as they please with minimal control by Israel over Gaza in general, nothing significantly impeding them from creating a prosperous economy, controlling their borders, air space and sea ports.</description>

Hello world!
In the past couple weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed two and a half particularly interesting things.
1) One was the anti-climatic detonation of what turned out to be a fake grenade found by a Palestinian farmer near the olive trees we were helping him harvest.
He showed us the grenade, which looked real enough to warrant concern. It had been partially buried with its pin removed, and two stones covering it.</description>

      <description>##04:53 Saturday 29 October 2005
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write a few lines about what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in the West Bank, though I have not actually picked olives yet.
I have a feeling this will be a long message, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to write it in sections, and may follow up with other sections soon.
======================= Section One: Vocabulary
When I first arrived here, I did not know the meaning / differences between &amp;ldquo;West Bank&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Gaza.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m in Jerusalem!
I haven&amp;rsquo;t really seen anything undeniably inappropriate, but there is definitely a distinction between areas for Palestinians and areas for Israelis, and definitely some weird stuff going on.
For the past two days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been staying in Faisal Hostel, basically across the street from Damascus Gate, a portal between the Old City of Jerusalem, and the rest of Jerusalem. The Old City is where a lot of biblical stories took place, including where Jesus was tortured and paraded through town, if I understand correctly.</description>
