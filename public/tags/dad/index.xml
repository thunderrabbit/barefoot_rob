      <description>16:42 Sunday 18 November 2018 JST I was the only other man to show up for D&amp;rsquo;s men&amp;rsquo;s circle tonight. We walked to a park near his house which has a wooded area.
Away from the busy-ness of the park, we settled in for a meditation and then got into my work. Wondering how to balance my projects, where to focus my energy, how to do the right thing?</description>
