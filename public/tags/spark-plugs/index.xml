Now I&#39;ve gotten my finances up to date. Have paid off the balance on fixing Scott just before I left for SWUUSI way back in July. Have paid my credit card off (mostly gas purchases, but also for my website hosting for the next 13 months) and all is lovely.
Going to put new spark plugs on Scott now.
I got these new crazy spark plugs with four (4) electrode things to spark.</description>
