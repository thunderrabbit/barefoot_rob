<p>I&rsquo;m on break now at JB, listening to the other class, where the
teacher&rsquo;s Japanesey English always kinda bugs me.  But the students
seem happy and have been in the class for a long time.</p>

<p>This morning thinking about C who apparently took my investment advice
before bitcoin blew up.  She quit her job and is overseas now.
hahahah nice!</p>

<p>Then working on AB, getting three alleged issues sorted.  Only one was
actually valid, but we had a chat on the phone and got them sorted.  I
fixed the one issue and then explained it to Kai who happened to come
by on her way to work.</p>

<p>Hi Kai!</p>

<p>Then went to SCC and talked to Tomoko and Midori for an hour each, not
counting lunch with Tomoko (Midori and Yuko chose not to join).</p>

<p>Zoom here to JB and two kids classes, the first of which went by
easily thanks to Patrick&rsquo;s (neverending) Day of Week game, and the
second of which went easily due to my shopping game.</p>

<p>Was barefoot between Sh and SCC.  Socks now, but will be barefoot on
the way home tonight.</p>

<p>Three hours of lessons in SCC today; looking forward to it!</p>

<p>On the way there, I hope to figure out why my local version of
mypowercircle.org will not compile with Hugo.  bah.  it was supposed
to be easy!!</p>

<p>Ah. I had gotten stuck trying to add Japanese language version of the
site, but never got it working.  It&rsquo;s better to just have an actual
Japanese speaker make the Japanese site, so I cut out the Japanese
content from the site and now it&rsquo;s working again.</p>

<p>Great lessons today with Miyako, Yuki (first lesson with her), Naoko,
Mizuho, Liliko, and Tomoe.</p>

<p>I worked for four companies yesterday.  First was my lesson in
Akabanebashi for Tariq.  Then walked to Nishi Azabu for MR
Laboratories client (company DNE yet).  Then walked across the Nishi
Azabu intersection to a lesson for TESS.  Then bus and train to
Kawasaki for 2 hours of lessons at my favorite, SCC.  Came home and
had one more lesson for MR Laboratories.</p>

<p>Today was the first time I worked five hours at SCC.  Due to a
schedule snafu, 1.5 hours with Liliko chatting about her trip to
Sydney and my trip to OZ, then Rick and Morty and Lucifer.  I didn&rsquo;t
think of Dirk Gently, but she considered getting Netflix to see the
others.</p>

<p>Today was the first of five 2-hour lessons this month at SCC.  Today I
helped Tomoko by making corrections to her written English.  She plans
to present the features of some of her company&rsquo;s products.  Pretty
cool stuff like elevators and batteries, and elevators that run on
batteries.  We studied up in their cafeteria on the 4th floor, and
then I went down the escalator to the third floor and went out the
exit I had never gone out before (but had seen many times).  Neat!</p>

<p>I discovered their wide screen TV wall is run via HDMI.</p>
