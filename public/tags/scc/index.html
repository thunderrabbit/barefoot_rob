<p>Lily had not seen the
<a href="http://mt3s.robnugen.com/">(silent) video snippets for Marble Track 3</a>,
so I sent her a link on LINE after we finished looking at her study
material.  I told her about cases of normally countable words used as
adjectives, (e.g. &ldquo;He has a 3 year old.&rdquo; vs &ldquo;His kid is 3 years old.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Today Naoko worked on introducing the history zone, including teacup
carrying dolls, perpetual clock, and the early days of electricity in
Japan.</p>

<p>What was it like back in the day when a simple thing like a few candle
power light bulb could be so impressive?</p>

<p>Yasu talked about the Meissner effect and flux pinning.  I would like
to do an experiment..  will the Meissner effect keep a thing suspended
above the magnetic table or is that only do to flux pinning?</p>

<p>Liliko confirmed some changes to some quiz questions for a new exhibit
that will be an audio recognition quiz.</p>

<p>Interesting to talk about the Meisner effect and flux pinning at SCC
today.  I have always assumed I understand the meaning based on the
English presentation, but I felt a bit unsure when I was breaking it
down in detail for Yasu as he was practicing his explanation of the
same.</p>

<p>My understanding: when a superconductor is below its critical
temperature it pushes (almost) all magnetic flux out of itself.  This
is the Meisner effect, apparently named after a scientist named
Meisner.</p>

<p>Impurities in the superconductor mean some lines of magnetic flux
pierce the superconductor and the superconductor &ldquo;remembers&rdquo; the
strength and direction of those lines and pins itself to them.  This
is called flux pinning, apparently not named after a scientist.</p>

<p>What is this &ldquo;memory&rdquo;?  I guess while the material is not a
superconductor, magnetic flux pierces it like any other non-ferrous
material.  As it becomes superconducting as it passes below its
critical temperature the flux already passing through it are&hellip; what
exactly?</p>

<p>(( I wonder if electrical resistance in normal conductors is what
causes the magnetic fields???  hmmm ))</p>

<p>Four lessons at SCC today.  One was shorter than expected due to a
(hopefully small) medical emergency.  Third lesson on the third floor
featured discussions of the other three lessons and hearing they
students really enjoy my passion for the topics.</p>

<p>Back at SCC today with four student for 30 minutes each.  Hitomi came
in for Lily, who could not come.</p>

<p>I bought
<a href="https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-arrows/">Cast Arrows</a>, a new
Hanayama puzzle because I could not solve it in 20 minutes.  (not that
I can solve most of them in 20 minutes, but this one <em>looked</em> like I
could solve it and then I was like &ldquo;woah that&rsquo;s not going to work???&rdquo;
because one piece was jjuustt slightly too big to fit through a gap.
Dang, I thought they were all the same size.</p>

<p>Today was the last lesson with Sweets Attendants.  (Their office is
being shut down at the end of this month, but I am leaving next week
for three weeks overseas.)</p>

<p>I met Tomoko at CPK at 11am and helped her carry pizza to their office
where we had a party, including candy I bought from the conveni ond
3F.</p>

<p>The party was fun, but afterward I unfortunately let myself get
sidetracked into dealing with some work related Excel spreadsheet
crap, but got it sorted out by moving the spreadsheet into Google
Sheets, where I can use the <code>=FILTER()</code> function.  Why can&rsquo;t I use
such a function in LibreOffice?</p>

<p>That took an hour out of our 4 hours allotted, but then I got to chat
with Midori for a bit about her plans.  At the end of our time
together, I went to the front desk and received a small white wooden
box with four drawers that I plan to use for Marble Track 3 parts.
Tomoko had apparently brought it to the office and apparently does not
want it anymore.</p>

<p>We stood to say bye to a bunch of guys leaving the conference room
right around the time that I also had to go.  That had me trapped a
bit longer than I wanted, during which time I wanted to reiterate they
can ask me for references or whatever they need for job search.  After
the conference room cleared out, I headed out and Tokyo-waved while
walking out the two sets of glass doors.</p>

<p>Gosh I am going to miss the sweets party attendants!</p>

<p>Today (and most Thursdays) I taught at SCC in Kawasaki.  Naoko
reviewed for her test next week.  Yasu reviewed the same material for
his test sometime in the future.  Azusa did much better with her
fluency and intonation for her presentation.  Liliko asked about the
brochure that has to change soon to accomodate new opening times.</p>

<p>After the lessons I went to say HI to Tomoko and Midori, but Midori
had the day off.  Tomoko showed me how to RSVP on Circle Square for
next month&rsquo;s badminton game.</p>

<p>Right now I am in a coffee shop in Lazona, and about to go to SCC
lessons for 3 hours, and then GG lesson for 1 hour.</p>

<p>Tears were apparently shed by one of the students at SCC; she is
scheduled to present tomorrow and found out today that her
presentation is going to be different than what she expected/practiced
for.  Yikes stripes I wish I could help more, but I suggested some
simplifications that will hopefully make it easier.</p>
