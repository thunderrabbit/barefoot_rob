      <description>18:34 Tuesday 23 February 2016 JST Labeled both as &amp;ldquo;Skewb&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Meffert&amp;rsquo;s Challenge&amp;rdquo; the toy flummoxed my ability to solve more than 2 (adjacent) faces correctly. It only has two slices(?) per face (whereas the Rubik&amp;rsquo;s Cube has four by my counting), but because they&amp;rsquo;re at screwy angles, I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet been able to wrap my little brain around how to do it.
The price went up while I was standing there playing with the sample model (from 2200 to 2600 yen) so if I buy it, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably look online instead of that toy store.</description>
