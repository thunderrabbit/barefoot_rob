<p>Fun in the sun today at SOGO Bootcamp.  We had to adjust our normal
workout area due to puddles, but all good and lots of fun.  I remet
Anuj, Valeria, Lisa, Alex, Ben.  Got to see Haruo and Jim again as
they led ultimate frisbee after bootcamp.</p>

<p>We played until about 1:18pm with about 6 on 6 down to 4 on 4 as
people had to go.</p>

<p>Played ultimate with an Aerobee yesterday with Suns Out Guns Out.  It
was challenging to control, but fun even so.  Even so, I bought three
ultimate discs from Club Jr.  I&rsquo;ll bring them out one at a time until
they&rsquo;re too old to use.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, my Y2K compliant disc cracked.  Boo.  It didn&rsquo;t get
used all its life, but it had a long life: 16+ years.  After cracking,
we kept using it to practice, and it cut someone&rsquo;s thumb upon them
catching it.  Oops.  To keep that from happening again, I converted
the crack into a split all the way to the other rim, though I wasn&rsquo;t
able to break the other rim.</p>

<p><p>Ultimate was great fun tonight!  I&rsquo;m super pleased that for the
second week in a row, Wende came out to watch me play!  She even
bought a collapsable chair so that she may enjoy watching for longer
without sitting on the ground or standing the whole time.</p>

<p><p>My game was great - I had a few great catches, including a couple
tall jumping catches that I would not have made in recent history.  I
made several scoring catches, and threw several scoring throws.  Even
blocked a couple of other players&rsquo; throws.</p>

<p><p>I came out of the game with only one slight injury: I made a
slide-on-the calf catch, scraping my left calf a bit.</p>

<p><p>Super happy that Wende came out to watch!!!</p>

<p><p>- - -</p>

<p><p>Before Ultimate, Wende took me to Best Buy, where I got my 11,000th
day present from her: a Handspring Visor.  It&rsquo;s basically a Palm Pilot
(it uses the Palm OS).  Apparently the guys who made Palm Pilots quit
the company to start Handspring.  (That&rsquo;s a rumor Wende heard from
someone at her work)</p>

<p><p>Yay!  Now I can write journal entries while away from home and
work!  Most super-duperly, I&rsquo;ll be able to write at the OKC rally this
weekend.  Super great!!!</p>

<p class=date>2:02pm CDT Saturday 13 May 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Great ultimate game today.  The field made play a bit tricky; the
grass was wet, but the ground was all hard and full of cleat-ruts.
Some suggested it was like broken concrete covered in ice.</p>

<p><p>When play began, each team only had 6 players.  Then at the same
moment, each team had 1 more player arrive.  Seven players on the
field is the norm, so we all played and neither team had subs.  (This
style of play (no substitutes) is called savage, or in this case
savage seven.)</p>

<p><p>We quickly scored 2 points, and they quickly began scoring as well.
For the first half, they were consitently 1 or 2 points behind us.  We
went into the half with a score of 7-5.  Neither team had taken their
time out.</p>

<p><p>Points began taking longer after the half, and we were tied 10-10
when the referees announced &ldquo;soft cap.&rdquo;  (Soft cap = the game is over
when a team reaches 2 more points than the current high score.)  At
the same time, we (or they; I&rsquo;m not sure) called time out.  Time out
was short, and when we re-entered the field, ref announced that hard
cap begins in 3 minutes (hard cap=next point wins). The point took
longer than 3 minutes, and we scored it.  11-10, we barely won.</p>

<p><p>All my offensive plays were good.  I never dropped the disc when
catching, and in one amazing (for me) catch, one-hander over my head,
I caught it for a point!</p>

<p><p>Defensively, I was a tad slower than the guy (Corey) I covered most
of the game.  He made some good cuts and got the disc a lot.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Next weekend is the finals in the tournament.  Schedule and
location will be announced on Wednesday.</p>

<p><p>Ultimate was great fun tonight!  The field was all mushy from the rain, causing me to slip a few times and fall a couple times.  One fall was a lovely slide and catch, slathering water/mud all up my leg and shorts and everything.</p>

<p><p>The stickers in the field were a bit worse tonight than previous nights.  I told Kat that I wasn&rsquo;t sure if my feet are getting wussy, or if the stickers are tougher or if the rain has any effect.  I quit playing after my feet and legs were pretty much tingling burning from stickers.</p>

<p><p>One might say, &ldquo;get some shoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Pssh.  it doesn&rsquo;t hurt <em>that</em> much.</p>

<p><p>Just finished my shower after ultimate tonight.  Got about 14 pics
from the game, but I don&rsquo;t necessarily expect them to all develop
well.  Meek took most of the pics tonight.</p>

<p><p>We played another game of Over 25 -vs- Under 25 and again, the Over
25 team won.  (25 = 25 years old) Then we played a normal game and my
team lost.  Still did quite well, but we lost 9-7.  (Game is to 7
points, win by two)</p>

<p><p>After just those 2 games (plus 1 this morning), I decided to go
home.  My feet are just a tad tender now.  (I play barefoot)</p>

<p><p>Have a great night!</p>

<p class=note>(written pre-phone)</p></p>

<p><p>(we are still without a dail tone)</p>

<p><p>Ultimate was alright today but not great.  I had
<br>1 great defensive play,
<br>1 great catch (for a point),
<br>1 great miss-the-disc smackola right below my nose,
<br>1 all-out run leaping for the disc miss and tumble, bumping my head on the ground.</p>

<p><p>But Dave was grouchier today than previous days.  He&rsquo;s usually hard
on himself when he misses a catch or throw, but today he was yelling
at lots of people.  He never singled anyone out harshly by name, but
it made the game less enjoyable for me.  I don&rsquo;t love/know him enough
to explain that.. maybe I can tell him anyway.</p>

<p><P>My mom is coming over today!  Should be in about 15 minutes.  Wende
turned on House of Pain <em>Fine Malt Lyrics</em> CD, which is pumping
throughout the house.  That will certainly be turned down when Ma gets
here.</p>

<p><p>I caught two points in our ultimate game today!  This is pretty
great because I don&rsquo;t get much disc handling on this team.  One point
was &lsquo;pushed&rsquo; to me (that means there was essentially no spin on the
disc (that means the disc was not spinning) which made it wobbly) and
I actually caught it easily.  The other point was zinged in toward me
and I had to reach one hand out to grab it.  Somehow, it was just a
perfect catch <em>bink</em> and it was caught.</p>

<p><p>We won 13 to 3.  Our defensive setup was good when we played zone
instead of one on one.  I&rsquo;m learning all these ultimate terminologies
and it&rsquo;s pretty fun.</p>

<p><p>Today is so windy!  That actually helped our defense.</p>

<p><p>One amazingly quick almost point I threw just ahead of my intended
recipient, but she just couldn&rsquo;t quite grab the disc.  I think it was
perfectly placed, though.</p>

and then the wedding.</p>

                        <p><title>Ultimate!</title>
<p class=date>6:55am CST Thursday 30 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Last night ultimate was a little bit wacky.  We played at 6:30 to
8:30; someone else had reserved the field during our preferred
timeslot of 8:30 to 10:30.</p>

<p><p>When we arrived on the field, about 30 people were enagaged in
softball practice as the season is apparently gearing up.  We told
them we had reserved the field, so they shrunk their practice to the
infield only.</p>

<p><p>This worked relatively well, although at random intervals a
softball would roll across our field.  We continued playing if the
ball was relatively far from the disc action, although on at least one
occassion, we stopped play specifically to ensure none of our players
would step on the ball stopped at their feet.</p>

<p><p>The middle of our field is essentially middle and left field for
the softball field (that makes sense), and the grass is pretty much
trampled down to just dirt.  The corners of our field and along the
side furthest from home plate, the grass and grass with burrs is
growing happily.</p>

<p>Pictured is one of zillions of sharp stabby things that ended up in my
feet when I ran to those portions of the field.  They were flat like
small sharp leaves.  Sean called it crab grass.  The calloused
portions of my feet had no problem with these little stabbers, but the
delicate portion of my feet (just between my feet and toes and the
arch of my foot) were all &ldquo;OWW!!&rdquo; when I ran through those areas.</p>

<p><p>At 8:30, our time was up; we left the field.  Four guys came on
field, and ironically enough, they all had discs with them!  They
introduced me and Bill (also from ultimate) to a new game called
Double Disc Court or DDC.</p>

<p><p>The rules are a bit strange compared to ultimate, but basically the
field is 2 big squares with a square shape of &lsquo;dead space&rsquo; between
them.  2 players in each square, throwing discs back and forth,
basically trying to make the disc land in the other square and not be
caught, or to have both players in one square holding the discs at the
same time.</p>

<p><p>I played two games with them, and would be interested in more if we
happen to see them again.</p>

<p><p>Just as DDC was beginning, the softball players wacked a ball way
into left field and almost hit Mark&rsquo;s vehicle. As a result, he began a
verbal altercation with the batter.  Nothing more than words, but I
felt a bit of fear for him calling them names while the guy was
presumably holding a bat.  (I didn&rsquo;t watch (but later Mark came back
and verified he walked &ldquo;in between them while the guy behind me had a
bat&rdquo;))</p>

<p><p>I wonder what will happen next week.</p>

<p><p>As I went to sleep that evening, I knew I would have some sort of
dream about fighting.</p>
