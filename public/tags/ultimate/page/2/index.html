<p><p>Ultimate was great fun today; our team won!  Barely barely we won..
We had an 8 to 4 lead at one point, and won 10 to 9.  The game had to
be cut a bit short because it was taking so long for us to get points.
Normal game is to 13.</p>

<p><p>During the game, I skinned my knee, made a couple of good throws,
and a couple of not good misses.  I did not handle the disc much.</p>

<p><p>Now it&rsquo;s time for our investment club meeting!  I just prepared
Valuation Statement for the club, and this will be our first regular
meeting.</p>

<p><p>Tonight the gang celebrates Maggie and Molly&rsquo;s birthday at Maggie and John&rsquo;s house!</p>

<p><p>Oh!! One more thing!  Manda sent me a fun URL!  <a

<p class=date>6:22am CST Friday 17 March 2000</p></p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t have a ride to Austin yet tonight, but in a way this is a relief; I don&rsquo;t really feel that I have the time to go.  I am still slowly working on cleaning up my apartment!  It&rsquo;s a meditative process, cleaning- after 10.5 years here, there&rsquo;s lots of memories and stuff.</p>

<p><p>In some ways, I&rsquo;m ready to let stuff go and begin anew.  (I&rsquo;ve never used that cliche&rsquo; before!)  But, there&rsquo;s still some items that I choose not to release just yet.  I just dunno where to put them!</p>

<p><p>I took lots of pictures of everything, but no telling when I&rsquo;ll get them up on my site.  (I wonder why haven&rsquo;t I manifested a digital camera into my life?)</p>

<p><p>Also this weekend, there is stuff to be done at work; I can definitely get paid some phat dollars, which would certainly make me feel less stress about moving.</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Are my priorities messed up?  Are my priorities just shifting?  Used to be that not much would have kept me from this tournament; especially not work.  There are some guys going up this morning to play all day in Austin Friday first.  I&rsquo;m choosing not to ride with them.</p>

<p><p>Meditatively yours&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Ultimate was great fun tonight!  Now I know how some of the guys (John) who play Saturday night have gotten so much better!  On Wednesdays the field is huge and everyone runs!  The structure of play is different, too: instead of playing a game to a certain number of points, we just play one point at a time.  We maintain 7 or 8 people on each team, and as people get tired of play, they swap with people on the sidelines.  That way we don&rsquo;t waste time picking teams between games, and it&rsquo;s a bit nicer to not worry about score.  We just don&rsquo;t keep score at all.</p>

<p><p>On Saturday there&rsquo;s an ultimate tournament, &ldquo;Huckin&rsquo; For Love,&rdquo; sponsored by <a href="https://www.strayconesports.com">www.strayconesports.com</a>.  I just found out about it tonight, and am on the edge of late turning in my registration!  So I shall drive it to the downtown post office tonight and save one mail hop.</p>

<p><p><hr align=left width=20%></p>

<p><p>After ultimate, I somewhat randomly stopped in the large movie theater parking lot and rode my (borrowed from Scott) unicycle!  It had been suggested by Scott that using a shopping cart would be a perfect way to help me learn!  So I found a cart that had been left out for the night and tried his suggestion.  It didn&rsquo;t work worth crap for me.  So I just tried to ride it.</p>

<p><p>The huge flat expansiveness of the parking lot did the trick!  While I had previously been able to uni one block (on not totally flat sidewalk), about 300 feet, this time I was able to uni 112 wheel revolutions, and then a bit later, 145 wheel revolutions!  Lemme do the math - 1 foot radius wheel ~= to 6.2 foot circumfrence, * 112 and 145&hellip; I rode 703 and 911 feet!!!  Super awesome!!!  Those records of mine included some directed gentle turns as well.  Great!!</p>

<p><p>(I didn&rsquo;t do the math above in my head - I used dc, the reverse-polish desk calculator that came with Linux.)</p>

<br>- Rob</p>

<p><p>Just finished taking a shower after playing Ultimate.  I play
barefoot, so they call me Wonderboy on the field.  This also means
that when I shower, large muddy streams flow from my feet to the
drain.  Kinda fun for the 5 year old in me.  I&rsquo;m all clean now,
though.</p>

<p><p>I got a surprising email recently from a woman named Dreama.  She
was doing genealogical research, looking for the middle name of her
GGGrandfather.  Turns out he is my GGGGrandfather, and she found his
name on my Geocities site.  Funniest thing is that I didn&rsquo;t know I had
genealogical stuff on my Geocities site!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m guessing it was simply a reference to his name from a few years
ago when Laura and I were doing lots of research together.</p>

<p><p>- - - - -</p>

<p><p>Super exciting news!!  I got the days-old counter working on my
site!  It was already <em>working</em> but only to tell how many days
old <em>I</em> am.  I wanted for anyone to be able to enter their birthdate,
and have it show their age in days!  And now, you <a
href="/cgi-local/days/day.cgi">can do it!</a></p>

<p><p>I also updated my <a href="/rings">webring links</a>.  I like the
new format for The Spirit Ring!  I will probably try to join one more
(or more) online journal rings.</p>

<p><p>With Love

<p><p>Today at work, with significant help from David and Brian, we got all our DSL related problems solved, except we still can&rsquo;t send email.  Brian believes it&rsquo;s cause our ISP didn&rsquo;t set up our reverse-DNS-lookup tables.  We can ask for the IP address of a machine name, but not for the machine name of one of our IP addresses.</p>

<p><p>Then I helped Liz at <a href="https://www.blanketstoyou.com">Blankets To You</a> get set up on a new ISP.  Didn&rsquo;t actually get her set up yet, but began the process of getting her account created there.  She&rsquo;ll have a real shopping cart once it&rsquo;s complete!</p>

<p><p>Bought Taco Bell on the way home and met Wende at my house.  We ate and she talked about her day and then I went to Ultimate at 10:35pm.</p>

<p><p>Very few people showed up, and we spent about 40 minutes literally just standing in the parking lot, talking our geek/fireworks/D&amp;D/ultimate talk.  The temperature was deemed too cold so we caravaned to House of Pies.</p>

<p><p>Now I get to the point of my whole story.  I didn&rsquo;t have shoes.  Well I actually had sandals under my carseat, but I wanted to try something not outrageous, but memorable enough to get a good story out of it.</p>

<p><p>I pulled my sweatpants down just a little bit, and covered up my feet with them!</p>

<p><p>I appeared to be wearing pajamas with feet sewn into them, and got a few giggles or looks from various people and the waitstaff.  I felt a tad nervous that they would say something, but they didn&rsquo;t.  Yay!</p>

<p><p>Great coversation and I told a joke:</p>

<pre>
A priest, a minister and a rabbi walked into a bar.  
The bartender said, "what is this, some kind of joke?"
</pre>

<p><p>When I first wrote the joke to Rocky yesterday morning over AIM, I typed</p>

<pre>
A priest, a minister and a rabbit walked into a bar.  
The bartender said, "what is this, some kind of joke?"
</pre>

<p><p>I like this version even better!</p>

<p><p>Tonight Ultimate was great fun.  I played three games (lost two) and made some good catch attempts.</p>

<p><p>One was a wacked out tall throw that put me near the fence and a bench (with Kristen on it) and I went sky for the disc, and had both hands on it, but they weren&rsquo;t together so it flipped out of my grasp.  doh!  I landed and scraped my arm on concrete (where the old benches were), but didn&rsquo;t stop at all.</p>

<p><p>A different time I had an equally wacked out catch and I caught it, super tall in the air one hand catch!  And I even had a great throw after that!  (There exists an unverified theory that the quality of the catch times the quality of the throw is a constant.)</p>

<p><p>Another time in an attempt to zip the disc down the fence to Becca, I totally threw it perfectly along the fence, but way over her head. &ldquo;Wonder!  She&rsquo;s not the bionic woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Stinky sweaty came home, tons of dirt down my shower drain, wrote this entry now going to bed.</p>

<p><p>Tomorrow is beach with Kristen and Farrah!</p>

<p><p>Oh, I named this file ultimate_population because at one point there were 28 people on the field &ndash; 14 against 14.  Crazy!</p>

<p>On Saturday night I played Ultimate with the guys at UH.<br />
This is the third week in a row I&rsquo;ve been back playing with them
and I&rsquo;m loving it!  I used to play all the time back in 1993 and
1994 and into 1995 and maybe even a tad beyond that.  I&rsquo;d like to
be a more regular player for some time to come.</p>

<p>For more info on this group, see <a href="https://www.stephenmcleod.com/ultimate.html">McLeod&rsquo;s Ultimate Frisbee Page</a>,
or <a href="https://members.aol.com/gremillion/diskone.htm">Rod Meek&rsquo;s SNS Ultimate</a>.</p>

<p>So anyway, on Saturday I had a super great throw and a super
great catch!</p>

<p>I also found that my endurance is getting better after just 3
weeks.  Nice.</p>

<p>The throw I made was for 1 point to Mike, who was speeding across
the endzone.  I targeted him perfectly and he made the catch
almost in self defense; that disc would have hurt!!</p>

<p>But the best part about the throw is I threaded it between two
defensive players as they closed in on the trajectory, and even
just past Chadwick, who was on my team, but not past the goal
line (I believe).  Anyway, super perfect throw and everything.</p>

<p>But the catch I made was even more classic!  Someone, I think
Sean, threw a long shot down the field to me.  Kathleen &ldquo;Cat&rdquo;
Catchings ran toward me to attempt to block the throw. I was
turned backwards running and she was facing me, closing in
quickly, but could not see the disc, which was closing in on
<em>her</em> even more quickly.</p>

<p>All at once, Cat kinda crashed into me, and I literally caught
the disc behind <em>her</em> back as it crashed into her.  So
funny, and would have been a great shot on tape!!</p>

<p>Great fun and I look forward to being back this Saturday!</p>

<p>(except for the possibility that Jason and I (Australia trip
Jason) might go on a short road trip to Enchanted Rock!)  That
will be cool if we go.  He is supposed to call me today and let
me know if he has the weekend off from work.  I told the guys at
Ultimate, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m not here next week, it means I&rsquo;m on top of
Enchanted Rock.&ldquo;)</p>

                        <p class=date>7:12pm Thursday 8 April 1999</p>

<p><p>Aw man, first, super duper special thanks to Wende for reminding me last night that today is Thursday and I was supposed to work at KTRU!!!!  I had totally forgotten it, and she mentioned it offhandedly (whatever that is supposed to mean) and I was like, &ldquo;!!!!!!!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Wende and I had just eaten at Dude and Veronica&rsquo;s house and it was gettin&rsquo; late. We still had to go to Sterling McCall to get Scott after he had his timing belt and water pump replaced.</p>

<p><p>See, the water pump failed, causing the timing belt to break, so they didn&rsquo;t warranty anything. I wasn&rsquo;t super joyful, but thankful that now I have 1 year or 12000 miles warranty on my timing belt <em>and</em> my water pump!  $590 was the price they quoted me.</p>

<p><p>We got there at like 11:30pm and it was only $540. Yay. Drove home and finished reviewing a CD that I have had for a while. Couldn&rsquo;t print my review since my printer was out of ink. D&rsquo;oh! (No, I wasn&rsquo;t going to hand write the review after typing it so neatly).  Went to bed at like 1am.</p>

<p><p>I had napped earlier in the day, so 3:20 am didn&rsquo;t come tooo early. I got up, showered (first time I&rsquo;ve showered before KTRU) drove in.  Matt was there on the 1-3am shift so I got into the building no problem.</p>

<p><p>He was playing a spoken thing&ndash;this dude was eloquently describing just how completely depressed he was and how he masochistically kept himself alive as punishment. The simple act of being alive felt difficult for this man.  The track was like 15 or 30 minutes long of depressed depression. It ended delightfully close to 4am.  I played &ldquo;All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth&rdquo; to lighten the mood.</p>

<p><p>I played a pretty great variety.  One 30 minute set had like Tejano, reggae, rock, jazz, ska, hardcore rap, and a 30 second segment of Neil Armstrong first stepping onto the moon all mixed in.</p>

<p><p>Got a call like at 6:15 or so. It was the next DJ calling in sick, inviting me to simply turn off the station at 7am.  Hmmmm.</p>

<p><p>I told him I would probably hang out for a bit longer, maybe try to call some other DJs to get someone in.  He said thanks, but that it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal to turn the station off.</p>

<p><p>Then I got a call around 6:50 am.  It was Jen in New Hampshire!! Woah!  She got RealAudio and was listening to me on the web! That is so super cool. Wow. I was already having fun and now I felt inspired to just keep on spinning records. I went until 9am when the next next DJ arrived.</p>

<p><p>Went home, ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and went to bed for about 1.5 hours.</p>

<p><p>Had dreams of KTRU, taking requests and playing music, and not having the music that was requested. Not really <em>bad</em> not having the music, just <em>oh well</em> not having it.</p>

<p><p>Woke up, wrote a long letter for some youth stuff, and made travel plans to visit Great America in early May.</p>

<p><p>Travel-plan-making was great.  I have a guest pass on America West Airlines, so I called them, but they didn&rsquo;t have round trip service to the city I wanted to visit (Chicago).  I called Southwest, for which I have a $200+ voucher, but they don&rsquo;t fly to O&rsquo;Hare.  Hmmm.  So I called Jayne, my favorite bestest travel agent (281-359-1010) and she was all, &ldquo;you wanna go to O&rsquo;Hare?  You&rsquo;ve got $290 flight credit with Continental with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>WHOAH!!  Sign me up!   I was so super duper thankful that she remembered (maybe their computers remembered, but who cares) and wow.  Yes oh yes, and the ticket will only cost like $210 of that so I&rsquo;ll have like $80 left. Awesome.  Thank you Jayne; thank you Angels.</p>

<p><p>Then Dude and I went to play frisbee.  My disc was in Wende&rsquo;s truck so he bought an ultimate disc and we went to Rice to play. The wind was super breezy and shifty and not quite gusty, making play challenging.</p>

<p><p>I did well for not having practiced much and Dude got some great throws fairly consistently.  I noticed he did better when he didn&rsquo;t really try or concentrate, but just let it happen.</p>

<p><p>A team was in an adjacent field so we went and watched/talked with them. Once their scrimmage was over, I joined a 3 on 3 man quick game.</p>

<p><p>OH MY GOODNESS I was so winded. Stomach in a knot, phlegm in throat, tired, panting, hot! Wow. I will do that more often to keep in better shape.</p>

<p><p>I got some pretty good throws and catches in, but didn&rsquo;t play as great as I have in the past. I haven&rsquo;t practiced in quite a while. I enjoyed the exertion.</p>

<p><p>Now Dude and I are going to work on website stuff.</p>

<p class=date>Sunday 22 March 1998</p>

<p>
Written by Rod Meek
<p>
And so our team has returned from the Centex Ultimate Tournament in
Austin,
flushed with...uh...defeat. The Saturday Night Specials have now been
renamed
the Saturday Night Special Olympics, and our entry fee was picked up by
our
"opponents" (though that word implies a reasonably even contest) who
were glad
to earn cheap victories at our expense. We lost three on Saturday and
then
another in single-elimination in the consolation (read: "losers")
bracket on
Sunday. The scores: 17-3, 17-2, 17-9, and 13-9. The number of points
required
for a victory seemed kinda variable--last year, teams only had to rack
up 11
to beat us.
<p>
The first game day did not start auspiciously for me, as I had no sooner
arrived at the field than I locked my keys in my truck. I had to send
Cog back
to his sister-in-law's house to get that all-purpose tool, a coat
hangar,
which worked marvelously well and quickly popped the lock. (Mental
note: don't
leave valuable stuff in truck at Saturday night game.) However, all else
looked good, except Paul declined to show, having a foreboding of what
was to
come. But at least the weather was nice, unlike the arctic conditions
at the
previous tournament.
<p>
Our first match was against Old Yeller, a pack of 40-year-olds, the same
blokes that whipped us in our Tuesday At Four incarnation last year. I'm
pleased to report we tripled our point output over last year's match
against
them. We really had no hope against these guys, and we still hadn't
quite
figured out what to do or why we were on the field. At least they put
us out
of misery with swift efficiency. Afterwards, we suffered our first
casualty,
John, who stole my thunder and stormed off the field in a rage, never
to be
seen again. Luckily, some German guy named Brauer had joined us, so we
still
were able to have four people loitering on the sidelines for
substitutions. 
<p>
The next game was against some other team that had looked to us to be
really
good. Unfortunately, looks were not deceiving, and they thrashed us
mercilessly. Mark commemorated this debacle by puking all over the end
of the
field.
<p>
The third massacre was against a pack of deranged mutants that spent a
great
deal of their time milling about the sidelines, muttering "Nub nub, nub
nub."
This diabolical tactic worked all too well on me and filled me with
soul-
numbing fear. It also had some effect on Brick, who showed up to taunt
us, and
soon found himself also puking all over the end of the field. But we
had other
skills than projectile vomiting, and the game was at least reasonably
close
this time. Since we had lost so rapidly in our first two matches, we
were
well-rested, whereas the Nub-nubs had fought hard and had only enough
energy
to maul us badly with little finesse. 
<p>
I completed my awful day by going back to the Ramada Inn (filled with
surly
and incompetent employees whose loathing of us was scarcely concealed)
and
accidentally  smashing my head into the underside of a staircase.
Unhappily,
my plan to get a concussion to excuse myself from the Sunday game came
to
naught, and it was with great reluctance that I found myself at the
field the
following morning.

This time we faced the Hammerheads from Corpus Christi, and at last we
met a
foe worthy of us, which means a team that was filled with as many old,
fat,
and slow people as ours, and nearly as many complainers and whiners and
the
dreaded Makers of Bad Calls. At one point we nearly had to convene a
civil
court out there just to sort through the calls and countercalls, though
Cog
was correctly busted for his infamous "Cog shuffle" when he was a
thrower. The
worst moments were when Will blazed across the endzone we were
defending and
slapped away what would have been a score, only to get tripped up with
the
intended receiver, who seized advantage of the situation to call a
foul, even
though the disk was blocked before the contact and batted so far away
that it
was unplayable even without contact. Then the Hammerheads reacted with
outrage
when Tim skied up for a catch, got speared in the back, and called his
own
foul. It pretty much devolved after that point, with strips, fouls, out
of
bounds, and picks being called in a flurry. I think I even heard "dog on
field" being cried out. In any event, we had a real chance in this
game, and
afterwards everyone felt pretty damn good.
<p>
Items of note:
<p>
1) The team MVP was the canopy Tim bought for the Sunday game, so we
would no
longer broil in the sun. We were the envy of all and could've charged
admission to our shaded splendor. I think we've got the equipment angle
pretty
well taken care of; we knew enough this time to bring chairs and
sunblock
(though most of us were too dim-witted to realize that the sun would
shine on
our arms and legs and not just our faces, so consequently horrific
burns were
a common affliction). 
<p>
2) Our team name got printed on a Centex shirt available for a low, low
price.
We can now be associated in print with such giants as Club Mud and the
Hound
Dogs. 
<p>
3) Wonder Boy was totally macking out there and was rewarded with
several new
phone numbers from female admirers.
<p>
4) Brick came in for a single series and discovered it is difficult to
play if
one has spent the day gorging on candy bars and cookie dough and then
hits the
field wearing long pants. 
<p>
5) Cog's young children were exposed to the traumatic experience of
seeing
Daddy slapped silly by our opponents. I sense many years of expensive
psychotherapy in their futures. 
<p>
As for my own performance, it can be catalogued as shown below:
<p>
1) No one can deny that I was periodically on the field.
<p>
2) There is no number 2.
<p>
I certainly excelled in general pessimism ("We're all doomed", "We
suck",
etc.), whininess ("How come we don't get to play other losers just like
us?"),
petty backbiting ("Bill's the single greatest menace we've ever
known--to our
own team") and explosions of rage ("Bite me, Tim!"). I can only
recommend that
should I choose to play at Centex again, I be kept heavily medicated at
all
times. 
<p>
Be that as it may, I would like to blame--er, thank--Tim for the effort
he put
into organizing this, which was no small feat. Now, if he can arrange
regular
scrimmages for us against Club Mud, maybe we'll have a shot next year...
<p>
"Wa-hoo!" (the sound from the other team every time I touched the disk)
