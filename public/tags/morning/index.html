<p>I got a seat on my preferred train.  I arrived in just enough time,
though it&rsquo;s reasonable to say I could have ridden more slowly to be
safer (down the big-ass whooo-hooo hill).</p>

<p>I met Dipendra today, a young man with design chops that far exceed my
own, and even Tariq&rsquo;s.  He is interested in doing the images for
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi">ConSwi, our swipe game</a> we
are making in Godot.</p>

<p>We met in a room that used to be a car showroom, but now features a
coffee shop because the car showroom was not making enough money.</p>

<p>I showed Dipendra how to get started with Godot and git.</p>

<p>Now headed home, but I will be back out tonight for Apocrypha, where I
will be telling my TJ Bike story of riding around Japan for 2 months.</p>

<p>Around 11am or so I hope to work on Marble Track 3.</p>

<p>Walked this morning for the first time in a week or so oops.  Good
times, including meeting the guy who I usually meet on Wednesdays
while he is on his exercise route.   Oh, and nodded to the kid who
runs around the neighborhood as well.</p>

<p>I have been writing in Japanese about the walk.</p>

<p>Behind our house there are some houses under construction.  There are
no gates blocking entry so I went inside to have a look.</p>

<p class="note">(English translations from my Japanese:)</p>

<p>Outside the houses there was scaffolding wrapped in blue fabric.  On
the first floor the fabric kept anyone outside from seeing
me inside, but on the second floor, the fabric had gaps so I was
nervous at times.</p>

<p>The houses were close together, so on the second level of the house I
entered, I used the scaffolding to cross over to the next house, via
its scaffolding.</p>

<p class="note">back to English:</p>

<p>I walked straight Where I normally turn right to go back home, but
this time it went straight and found an interesting place I have
never seen before.  I think it is a recycling plant but I&rsquo;m not
sure. It has a nicely paved pathPeople can walk on along its length,
But the fences are pretty clear about where they want people not to
go.  I didn&rsquo;t go anywhere they didn&rsquo;t want me to, but through the
hedge I took a picture of one of their trucks.</p>

<p>For a moment across my mind that it might be neat to get a job there,
but I can imagine it would get old pretty quickly.  Maybe they offer
tours that we can just see inside facility.  That would be pretty
neat, and worth checking into, but I probably won&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p>After walking the length of their facility, I walked along the road
that had no cross streets so it seemed to be next to a river or some
other shallow valley.</p>

<p>The valley prevented me from turning right to go back toward the
house, soI ended up walking longer than I might have plans too, but it
was a pretty great walk.  On the way back I recognized that I had
walked along the street before, <em>and</em> I noticed it was next to the
recycling facility.  So I had walked next to the recycling facility
before, but I just didn&rsquo;t realize it.</p>

<p>TLDR Who cares.  3.1km walked.  the end.</p>

<p>Just before 5am, Lin let Jennie outside for her morning adventures.
Soon thereafter we could hear her catching up with another cat.  I
woke up for my walk and headed toward the altercation.  Unfortunately
my approach was a catalyst for amplification of the catastrophe.  They
catapulted away from each other and Jennie ran under a car before I
could catch her.</p>

<p>I continued walking and went 2.9 km according to Google.  My phone
didn&rsquo;t track me as precisely as I would have liked, though.  I hoped
to see some more waypoints than I got on the map.  Might have to find
an app to do it.</p>

<p>I have decided to wake up at 5am each day, and on the five days I do not
have to immediately go to work (for which I have already been waking
up at 5am), I will go for a brisk walk around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Today I went up the hill and along the ridge and up left on a street I
had never walked before, then up a hill into a park and then omg down
a spooky mossy staircase with spiderweb strands hitting my face and
cicadas buzzing my ears and mosquitoes chomping my legs.   Upon arrival
at the bottom, I turned left onto a little street and met Mr Kasahara
who was like, &ldquo;can I show you?&rdquo; and I was like &ldquo;please!&rdquo; and he showed
me a rainbow colored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysochroa_fulgidissima"><ruby><rb>玉虫</rb><rt>たまむし</rt></ruby>
insect he called a <em>tamamushi</em></a>,
and went on at length about how it was such a rare find.  I was able
to understand about 50% of what he was saying.</p>

<p>The area where he lived used to be named Kasahara, but the Odawara
clan(?) came over and Mr Kasahara had to flee (for his life).  He is
85 years old, and apparently has a fair few stories to tell.  I hope
to see him tomorrow and bring my recorder to record some of his
stories for science and study etc.</p>

<p>When I took the train this morning at 6:24am, it was running on time
no worries.  However, apparently trains started running late soon
thereafter.  One of my students happens to live near my same station
(新百合ヶ丘) and she said the trains were late, which caused her to
arrive late.  I am thankful for my policy of arriving 20+ minutes
early.</p>

<p>Awake.  Unpacking and repacking my car to go visit the Bibby's for
a few days.  Ironically, Sean is in Utah now, so I can't hang out with
him exactly yet.</p>

<p class=date>4:52pm</p>

<p>Been chillin' with Janette, Sean and Joey's mom.  Joey just woke up
a bit ago.  Janette has been cooking all day ("20 hours" she says) and
I've helped a tiny bit by cutting parsley (I think) and jalepenos and
mixing tabouli.  We've been listening to some of my KTRU tapes.</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>Woke up and read part of <em>Shield</em> and talked to Torger and Galen and others on staff out on our cabin porch. Then breakfast and sat at the same table with mostly the same group as dinner last night. We talked and chilled a bit and bounced a plastic ring from a coke bottle plastic cap.

<p>At the Spirt Circle I sat between Carol and Jeremy who sang "Greasy Grimey Gopher Guts" for everyone.  Well he started it but didn't remember quite all the lyrics..

<p>I made an announcement encouraging people to write in what we in the Southwest District call the "Big Gray Rally Book," a YRUU diary that is actually volume II. I started volume 1 back in July 1996 at the New Orleans Rally.

<p>Then someone (I think Allison or maybe Mimi) led the "Happy Boy" song, which I didn't know, but many people did and sang along with it.  Something about a dead dog and his guts in a jar.

<p>During the Growth Stages workshop, we did a bonding game and had a ten minute nap, during which I actually fell asleep!  Nice.
Then we shared stories about our first memories before 5 years old.
