And by add, I mean using MCEdit, I injected an schematic of the Empire State Building (unfinished) by Avalanche_Ali
I placed it in the middle of a plain at first, but then thought it would look weirder in a forest, so I put it there instead.
Beautifully, without having really tried hard, the minecart track I had built went straight into the center of the building, aligned perfectly.</description>
