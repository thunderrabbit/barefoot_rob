      <description>12:34 Friday 23 December 2016 JST Lin and I just completed a small piece of art I titled Lin&amp;rsquo;s Heart because it started with a heart shape which she drew in light blue. We took turns drawing on it. It&amp;rsquo;s not exactly an exquisite corpse, because she chose the colors each time we drew on it, and we each only drew with one color at each swap.
I kinda want to make an art website; maybe I should re-start uploading to Tumblr, Canvas, and then post items for sale on the bitcoin one.</description>

      <description>16:11 Wednesday 22 June 2016 JST Sat in the park and worked on the drawing which Yoko started.
I had drawn some yellow drops around her green Vs and one of the yellow drops was all lopsided so I was like &amp;ldquo;bluh&amp;rdquo; and stopped drawing for a while.
Like for over a month while we were busy with moving etc, and I just didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything on those pieces started by the GG class.</description>

You take care of the quantity. I&#39;ll take care of the quality. - God  I think that&amp;rsquo;s from The Artists Way.</description>

      <description>16:18 Wednesday 16 December 2015 JST Today I created a post for White Dots on Patreon. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the piece is finished, but it&amp;rsquo;s close!
Today I added tiny dots around the white dots (and other colors), added the squiggly yellow line that ended up being shaped something like the kanji for mountain: 山, and drew straight-ish lines under the yellow squiggle and under its kanji.</description>

      <description>17:32 Thursday 19 November 2015 JST Nice.
I&amp;rsquo;m chillin&amp;rsquo; at a conveni near my lesson in Akihabara.
I brought a new (small) shikishi to start a new drawing. However, when I pulled it out of my bag, I realized they only markers I have are Posca, which I sorta kinda don&amp;rsquo;t always like. I like the ink, but the nibs on these particular pens seems scratchy and don&amp;rsquo;t always draw nice lines.</description>

      <description>17:48 Thursday 29 October 2015 JST In this morning&amp;rsquo;s lesson, Sampei named my latest drawing &amp;ldquo;Summer Vacation&amp;rdquo; after I asked him for a suggestion. I loved it, and immediately wrote the name on the back, plus &amp;ldquo;(named by Sampei)&amp;rdquo; though I forgot to put the date that he named it. So here it is, in my journal.
I worked on the piece a bit more, actually encompassing one of the baseball looking shapes in the background colors.</description>

      <description>18:19 Tuesday 29 September 2015 JST Yoshie canceled her lesson today, so I decided to work on a maze instead. I&amp;rsquo;m starting with a piece I had started already.
19:36 Tuesday 29 September 2015 JST I just finished a piece I&amp;rsquo;ve titled &amp;ldquo;One Teleport Maze&amp;rdquo; because, if it&amp;rsquo;s a maze, and if the start and end points are the bulbous areas in opposite corners, and if the dots are teleports, and if the paths are either the black paths or the swirly paths, I can solve it by using a single teleport.</description>

      <description>##20:25 Saturday 10 January 2015 JST##
I just finished a new piece I&amp;rsquo;ve called &amp;ldquo;Underlined&amp;rdquo;, which features ink on paperboard (色紙). I started it a few days ago by drawing some shapes without my glasses. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take a picture of them before drawing other lines, but they&amp;rsquo;re still visible, due to my policy of not overlaying colors.
I might upload an image of it here, but for now, it&amp;rsquo;s visible at its shortlink: https://art.</description>

      <description>16:09 Monday 15 December 2014 JST Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s not really a maze; there are no dead ends except for the start and finish points. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a puzzle to figure out how to connect the start and end points.
Anyway, After about 4 hours of work, I&amp;rsquo;ve finished the final draft:

Now I just need to draw all the black lines on the actual panels.

Over the weekend I worked on expanding the four pieces to a larger project. At this point it looks like this:

I haven&amp;rsquo;t got the maze planned exactly, but I want to draw a maze that spans the panels. The points at which the maze goes off the edge of panels will be aligned in a way that the panels seem to fit together in multiple ways.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to call them; they&amp;rsquo;re not really drawings, nor are they paintings.. They&amp;rsquo;ll eventually be pieces of a maze puzzle thing.
I&amp;rsquo;ll draw a maze or two behind them; I drew some dots on the edges where the maze paths would cross over the different panels, but I made a mistake that will require drawing some more pieces. Maybe it was intentional so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have 4 pieces as a set, because four is unlucky in Japan.</description>

Today I went to Yodobashi Camera to buy a camera, but I wanted to confirm that it would work with my computer before purchase. They didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have any web cameras out of their boxes, so I figured I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to test one before buying.
Rather than try banging my proverbial head against the unbendable rules, I went to Bic Camera to see if they had cameras I could use.</description>

I just thought of a new idea for DrawQuest. I can&amp;rsquo;t show the full animation here, but if you have an iPad, download the app, and find me (thunderrabbit), you can see it.
I drew a snowman who then thought about killing his maker, but then the dog barked and the snowman reverted to his normal happy state.
This works easily because the eraser too erases down to the original image, not down to the blank canvas.</description>
