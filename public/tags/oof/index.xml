      <description>11:42 Tuesday 11 October 2016 JST I have a headache, which I think is due to too much computering.
How interesting that today&amp;rsquo;s lesson topic was compulsory vacation days.
19:24 Tuesday 11 October 2016 JST Headache is better after going home for a nice nap and a little pink tablet Lin gave me in case of headache. Also just walked to Olympic to buy two liters of orange juice.</description>

      <description>19:03 Friday 08 July 2016 JST The previously written entry was written on Wednesday night. I&amp;rsquo;ve been toting my computer around today Friday, and spent an hour working on some worksheet for possible new class starting in September, after deploying a new version of CB websites.
In today&amp;rsquo;s advanced class, I talked about fiat currency and WTC7, and the students were like &amp;ldquo;realllllyyyyy?????&amp;rdquo; so I invited them to look it up.</description>
