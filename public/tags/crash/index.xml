      <description> 17:38 Sunday 22 July 2018 JST We were in a B52 that for some reason had to crash so they were going to simply move all the refrigerators from one side to the other so it would go off balance and plummet down at an angle, ensuring its destruction so the enemy would not be able to use anything from it. </description>

      <description>05:07 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 I have had a few crashes in Godot in the over the past couple of days, and each time it was due to using queue_free() (or apparently misusing it). I took them out in favor of hide() and remove(). The crashes seem to have gone away.
14:42 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 (44 minutes to Dubai) I would like to extend my custom Godot class, but have not been able to figure out how to do it.</description>
