<p>I slept on 南武 line from 登戸 to 川崎 station today.  Nice to get a
57 minute sleep on a 30 minute trip.  (The train sits in Noborito for
27 minutes before departing.)</p>

<p>Early morning lessons on Wednesday are back after the summer break.
I&rsquo;ve been teaching here for some years, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t mind&rdquo; if the lessons
were taken over by someone else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t mind&rdquo; in quotes because that was the phrase Eriko
doublechecked with me to be true regarding the lesson.</p>

<h5 id="09-46">09:46</h5>

<p>The lesson was fine today, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind coming back next week
(probably).  Ayano, Satoshi, Ai, and I talked about summer vacation
for a minute and then dove back into the book.  To help them be
involved in their own learning, I have taken to having them be
&ldquo;manager&rdquo; for various exercises in the text.  This helps me because I
might otherwise skip or dwell on something too difficult or easy for
them.</p>

<p>Well, I missed the first day of the month by 3 minutes.  I have been
zoned out in front of my computer longer than 3 minutes so oh well.</p>

<p>Logged 6 hours of work and noticed how much longer it will take.  At
10 minutes per line, and 400 more lines to change that&rsquo;s 4000 minutes
(hopefully max!), but that is just to get rid of a single singleton.</p>

<p>I am tired enough that I cannot do the math in my head.  4000 minutes
/ 60 = 65 hours..  dang that has got to be too much.  5 minutes per
line and we get 32 hours.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main point is that I feel shame for mis-guessing how long
it would take.  But I gotta let AB know the estimate.</p>

<p>I think I will start up their new DB server and use the existing web
server and new DB server for a bit, and then spin up new DB server
with Ubuntu 18.</p>

<p>Great Integration Group tonight after meeting a potential new man.  He
has been in Tokyo for 6 months and may join on the first week of
June.  Met another man who has already attended [New Warrior Training
Adventure]() so we welcomed him into the circle tonight.</p>

<p>Just watched a couple episodes of Rick and Morty on Netflix.  From
season 1, the Zigerian scammers, and then the Mr Needful half of the
Pluto episode (, fast forwarding through the Pluto parts).</p>

<p>This was after Japanese lesson with Mel, who often gives me bonus time
yay!  We read a few pages of a Doraemon book with 100 four-kanji words.</p>

<p>All that was after eating chocolate on the way home from the station
after reading <em>Planet on Purpose</em> after talking to Yoko after the
lesson after receiving the remainder of the chocolate rabbit she
brought to class after she arrived late after we had been talking
about <em>Planet on Purpose</em> after talking about Skype after having
talked about the lesson from last week after Mayumi asked me about it
after not having been there then.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s lesson started after I helped some people from Atlanta Georgia
charge their Suica after I charged my own card after arriving in
Akihabara after taking the train from Kawasaki after buying a bottle
of milk tea after noting it came with a chipmunk character (from Chip
and Dale) <em>inside</em> an adjacent bottle after going into the shop after
having finished four lessons at the SCC, including tweaking some
translation about a new exhibit, after learning that &ldquo;exhibit&rdquo; in
Japanese is てんじ, though I am not sure of its spelling.</p>

<p>I had gone to SCC after reading <em>Planet on Purpose</em> on the train after
leaving home after working on ConSwi after attending the Court of
Support meeting after checking in and out of my Integration Group,
&ldquo;Cyber Knights&rdquo; after having breakfast after Lin made it after we woke
up.</p>

<p>Heh.  Well, it was pretty great.  Dirk Gently&rsquo;s Holistic Detective
Agency was good enough that I just watched the last four (4) episodes
in a row.  At 40+ minutes each that&rsquo;s 160+ minutes or about oh my god
I have to go to bed.</p>

<p>Now it is apparently canceled, but I hope not.

<p>The past few entries are dated some hours after they happened, but
this one is being written in real time.  I gotta wake up in 3
hours. shit shit shit.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I can sleep for a bit on the train.  Unfortunately, I can
only sleep for 50 minutes on the train and it usually leaves me
groggy.</p>

<p>This morning I woke up on time to arrive near Zavas at 7:45am.  That
lesson was fine, and then I-group online was equally fine.</p>

<p>Went to lunch with Kai, and talked about our respective presentations
while eating at Kung Fu Panda (?) in the food court.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2017/fortune_12_jan_2017.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2017/thumbs/fortune_12_jan_2017.jpg" alt="fortune 12 jan 2017" /></a></p>

<p>Had an extra hour before lesson at T, so I went to Unidy and got a
hook for my wallet chain, because my previous hook broke.  The guy at
the info desk spoke English more effectively than I would have
guessed.  He helped me find the perfect hook.</p>

<p>Then to T where I taught two lessons in the showroom.  Long time no
see Midori and not-so-long time no see Tomoko.</p>

<p>Then to lesson with GG and talked to Yoko for a bit afterward; she
seemed to like that I was wearing a suit today!</p>

<p>Woah falling asleep there.  はなしたくない.  Wow.</p>
