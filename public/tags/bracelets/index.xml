      <description>22:11 Wednesday 27 February 2019 JST So surprised when Misato gave me and Lin matching tiger eye bracelets today! I had commented on Misato&amp;rsquo;s bracelet last week (and apparently praised it too much!) cause it caught my eye, and I had never seen dark tiger eye before. Super striking!
I guess this means I should buy her something kinda special from my trip.
I probably should have gotten a picture of our matching bracelets.</description>
