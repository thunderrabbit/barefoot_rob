      <description>21:45 Friday 03 August 2018 JST Apparently there is a big sale on Drops.

From me to Drops via their in-game help
Pricing is incorrect in Japanese yen 0.367 yen is like US$0.00367 I can do with that price! ;-)  I was impressed with how quickly I got a reply!
Hi, Thanks for playing Drops and contacting us! We&#39;re really sorry about any confusion and inconvenience! What you see in the app is the price for one month in your currency, but the total for the yearly subscription is billed as one up-front payment for the full year at the time of subscribing.</description>
