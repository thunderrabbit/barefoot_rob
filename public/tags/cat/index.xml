      <description>11:01 Thursday 14 December 2017 JST Jennie went to the doctor today who said her paw had recovered enough to let her go outside. So great! I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to keep her inside for a week or whatever it was before. She&amp;rsquo;s quite persistent in explaining where she&amp;rsquo;d rather be!</description>

      <description>13:59 Tuesday 12 December 2017 JST Giving Jennie some cuddles today, I noticed an extra pad on her foot. Hmmm. That&amp;rsquo;s not a pad, that&amp;rsquo;s a swollen something something. fortunately Lin still had time to take her to the clinic; I am headed to work now. Hopefully and presumably she will be okay!</description>

      <description>15:12 Friday 27 October 2017 JST Jennie has a pet door in our room now so she can go in and out. The door has a lock so that it can work both directions, neither direction, or this xor that direction.
The guy cut a hole in the glass and it was not like on Mission Impossible. He used a diamond tip to make a circle and then a smaller circle, and then a grid of cuts in the middle of the small circle, then tap tap tapped with a metal rod.</description>

      <description>20:05 Wednesday 29 March 2017 JST I just bought three styrofoam blocks for Jennie. She is currently able to leap from our balcony onto the sunroom roof below, then climb down the nearby tree.
She can barely jump back up, and doing so requires her to balance on the edge of the gutter. The dusty slightly sloped plastic sunroom roof does not give her enough grip to leap from it.</description>

      <description>17:54 Monday 10 October 2016 JST Oops Jennie went outside. We&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to keep her in at night because Lin is worried Jennie will come back with an injury. I think it was a fluke, but even so I&amp;rsquo;m open to keeping Jennie closed inside at night. Except when I leave the window open above my desk. Jennie jumped up on my shelf. &amp;hellip; and she&amp;rsquo;s gone.</description>

      <description>12:27 Sunday 06 March 2016 JST So it took a bit of time, but we have finally double-triple-quadruple-confirmed that our cat Ted will our neighbor&amp;rsquo;s cat Ebu because Ted enjoys our neighbors house more than ours. Sad to see him go, but happier to see him happier there than here. Apparently he sleeps with her each night, whereas he rarely/never slept with us.</description>

For the party at JB school, we had to wrap some presents. Lin wanted to use this huge bag but I thought it was too big. &amp;ldquo;See? It&amp;rsquo;s big enough for Jennie!!&amp;rdquo;</description>
