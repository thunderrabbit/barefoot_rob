<p>Usually Lin checks in with me on her way home, but she has not checked
in with me yet.  I wrote this to Mark on LINE:</p>

<pre><code>23:00 barefoot Rob Nugen Just checking in now; Lin is not home and not answering her phone or LINE
23:01 barefoot Rob Nugen It's possible she is out with friends, but usually she tells me if she will be late
23:01 barefoot Rob Nugen I won't seriously worry until after last train
23:02 barefoot Rob Nugen I do not need any support now, but I will let you know if I do.
23:02 barefoot Rob Nugen I assume she will come home, so from your point of view please treat this as
                         no news is good news.  i.e no further updates from me means she came home fine.
</code></pre>

<p>She called me; she is fine, just was out with co-workers due to
someone&rsquo;s last day at work.</p>

<p>Jennie went to the doctor today who said her paw had recovered enough
to let her go outside.  So great!  I didn&rsquo;t want to have to keep her
inside for a week or whatever it was before.  She&rsquo;s quite persistent
in explaining where she&rsquo;d rather be!</p>

<p>Giving Jennie some cuddles today, I noticed an extra pad on her foot.
Hmmm.  That&rsquo;s not a pad, that&rsquo;s a swollen something something.
fortunately Lin still had time to take her to the clinic; I am headed
to work now.  Hopefully and presumably she will be okay!</p>

<p>Jennie has a pet door in our room now so she can go in and out.  The
door has a lock so that it can work both directions, neither
direction, or this xor that direction.</p>

<p>The guy cut a hole in the glass and it was not like on Mission
Impossible.  He used a diamond tip to make a circle and then a smaller
circle, and then a grid of cuts in the middle of the small circle,
then tap tap tapped with a metal rod.  It was nothing like silent spy
stuff in the movies.</p>

<p>I just bought three styrofoam blocks for Jennie.  She is currently
able to leap from our balcony onto the sunroom roof below, then climb
down the nearby tree.</p>

<p>She can barely jump back up, and doing so requires her to balance on
the edge of the gutter.  The dusty slightly sloped plastic sunroom
roof does not give her enough grip to leap from it.</p>

<p>So, my plan is to make a set of stairs for her to more easily ascend
and more quietly descend.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a slight risk that other cats will be like &ldquo;hey meow, I can do
that,&rdquo; and try to come inside, but it&rsquo;s worth the risk.  I think
there&rsquo;s a greater risk of Jennie jumping down one day and cracking the
plastic roof of the sunroof which would certainly be more expensive to
repair than 3500 yen for these blocks.</p>

<p>Oops Jennie went outside.  We&rsquo;ve been trying to keep her in at night
because Lin is worried Jennie will come back with an injury.  I think
it was a fluke, but even so I&rsquo;m open to keeping Jennie closed inside
at night. Except when I leave the window open above my desk.  Jennie
jumped up on my shelf.   &hellip; and she&rsquo;s gone.</p>

<p>So it took a bit of time, but we have finally
double-triple-quadruple-confirmed that our cat Ted will our neighbor&rsquo;s
cat Ebu because Ted enjoys our neighbors house more than ours.  Sad to
see him go, but happier to see him happier there than here.
Apparently he sleeps with her each night, whereas he rarely/never
slept with us.</p>

<p>For the party at JB school, we had to wrap some presents. Lin wanted to use this huge bag but I thought it was too big.  &ldquo;See?  It&rsquo;s big enough for Jennie!!&rdquo;</p>
