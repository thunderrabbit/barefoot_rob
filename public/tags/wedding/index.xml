      <description>17:17 Saturday 30 January 2016 CST We drove up to Mt Bonnell for marriage ceremony delivered by Ma and witnessed by Jon, kT, and Alicia. Fred couldn&amp;rsquo;t join due to migraine.
Up the steps from the parking lot, I walked barefoot, and asked Lin to take picutres of me for the TV thing.
There were so many people near the top that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a very good view, so we headed down the hill a bit and found a stone on which we stood for the ceremony.</description>
