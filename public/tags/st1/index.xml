      <description>23:29 Sunday 08 October 2017 JST Yeah what can I say besides great except it wasn&amp;rsquo;t completely what I had hoped since I was looking for a bit more facilitation training. It will come though. This training was about the NWTA; next training is more focused on facilitation.
