      <description>22:24 Wednesday 29 August 2018 JST I have begun to unpack my life mission: to create a world of safety, love, and connection by teaching, inviting, and sharing. This is connected to the men&#39;s group work I do and lead. My intention is to make the high E.Q. tools as natural skills for everyone to know. It is my intention to start promoting this philosophy of living: heal the emotions within and experience a more fulfilling life.</description>

      <description>05:40 Wednesday 29 August 2018 JST The Mission Workshop was a great success last night, with 8 men in attendance. We tapped in to our Little Boys Deepest needs, then visualized an ideal world with the needs met. Where everyone has had this deepest need met. What kind of world is it? _________, ___________, ____________.
Then we went back to this ideal world and found ourselves living within it. Not only living, but interacting and behaving in new ways in this ideal world.</description>
