      <description>09:22 Friday 29 January 2016 CST I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan super well, but considered having the bear appear while we went bowling, or as if it had appeared from the sky while skydiving.
On second thought, a skydiving bear would take away from the skydive itself, so I&amp;rsquo;m glad we didn&amp;rsquo;t do that.
Anyway, I unceremoniously opened the box this morning, and the bear is currently under the covers on Lin&amp;rsquo;s side of the bed in Ma&amp;rsquo;s apartment.</description>

      <description>20:51 Thursday 03 December 2015 JST Lin is like, &amp;ldquo;am I going to get my bear or not?&amp;rdquo;
Of course she is, but I keep telling her no so it will be a surprise when she gets it. Sigh. This happens every year, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if she knows she&amp;rsquo;ll get it and is just harrassing me, or if she really doesn&amp;rsquo;t know. Hmmm!</description>

I got Lin the 2014 Harrod&amp;rsquo;s bear, &amp;ldquo;Jasper&amp;rdquo; (I think). I&amp;rsquo;ve essentially promised her one each year, but each year I try to convince her that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t need another so she won&amp;rsquo;t expect it when she receives it.</description>

      <description>##23:12 Thursday 22 November 2012
Lin asked me tonight if I planned to buy the gift she wanted for Christmas.

Don&amp;rsquo;t tell Lin, but I ordered it two days ago. I didn&amp;rsquo;t tell her tonight because that&amp;rsquo;s not much of a Christmas surprise if I tell her now! It was a bit difficult not to tell her, but I was able to convince her that I planned not to buy it with responses like, &amp;ldquo;what are ya gonna do with it anyway, but just put it on the shelf?</description>
