      <description>17:42 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST 5:30pm meeting is underway, but I am only being asked questions via text while here at JB since they are doing it in Japanese (at CB).
17:47 I&amp;rsquo;m dialed in now.
17:51 They are asking how the API works. I explained it is like a web server which gives just data instead of data and HTML. They said they understand that, but how does it work?</description>
