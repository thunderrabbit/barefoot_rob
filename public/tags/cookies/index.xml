      <description>19:03 Sunday 17 June 2018 JST Went to SOGO with everyone and then Cookie Time with Aki, but the line was too long for her so we bounced. Said bye to her at the station and then went back for cookies! Bought a shake, but it was more like blended milk than blended ice cream. Bought a lemon cookie for Lin and headed home.
&amp;ldquo;Oh I forgot my water bottle&amp;rdquo; so I headed back to the park and saw Menya and them leaving the park.</description>

      <description>01:46 Tuesday 13 March 2018 JST 09:46 Monday 12 March 2018 Portland Recreational marijuana is legal in Oregon. I took advantage of this fact last night and had a really overall positive experience with several experiencial teachings I gained.
I am still a bit affected as I write this, sitting in the airport in Portland, waiting for my flight back to Narita.
The most interesting aspect about the experience itself was the time stretching.</description>
