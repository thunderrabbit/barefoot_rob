      <description>09:09 October 9th, 2016 JST Today is my 17000th day!
SOGOhas been moved to 2pm because it&amp;rsquo;s raining hard enough to be considered rain in my book!
Tonight after the workout I&amp;rsquo;m going to join Lin at her sisters for food and karaoke, which luckily landed on my 17000th day!
17:52 Monday 10 October 2016 JST Karaoke was great! It was Lin, Charu, and Mikako; we all had fun singing though by the end I was sooo tired I just lay down and listened.</description>
