      <description>09:57 Monday 23 April 2018 JST Good lesson at IL this morning, though only two students attended. I praised the student who came 35 minutes late to thank her for attending even though it was apparently a challenge to join.
Next week&amp;rsquo;s lesson is canceled due to a week of holidays, so on May 7th, I will invite them to talk about their holidays in English.</description>

Lesson at Il was okay but not great. I had what I thought was a good plan, but it resulted in silence during the latter half. Hmmm.</description>
