      <description>19:15 Sunday 13 May 2018 JST Hahaha I am really entertained by this next portion of the video. Didn&amp;rsquo;t even really see it coming until just the other day when I needed a way to hold up a rail while it gets glued into place.
  Since June 2017, I have spent 7.5+ days on Marble Track 3.
The resulting video snippets, available via https://mt3s.robnugen.com/, total approximately 9 minutes 39 seconds.</description>
