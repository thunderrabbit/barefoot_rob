                        <p class=date>Friday 5:04pm CST 31 December 1999</p>

<p><p>This is the last day of the nineteens!!!!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There's the whole debate about, "well, it's not really the millenium
or even the century cause way back in the day they started counting with
1 not 0 blahdiddyblah."

<p>Yes, I say, but realistically, what is *cool* is seeing those 000
zeros roll up onto the calendar.  I mean, driving in the car people
don't say oh look!  We just turned over 2001 miles!

<p>2000.  That's what's cool.

<p>(plus, kings and such changed the calendars arbitrarily to fit their
schedules or the schedule of the seasons or for whatever reasons they
had at various times back then.)
</blockquote>

<p><p>So anyway, this is the last of the 19s.  I mean I look back at my
ancestors and they may have been born in 1910 or 1903, but just&hellip; just
being born a few years prior and  <em>bing</em> it&rsquo;s 1800s and I think,
&ldquo;man! that&rsquo;s <b>old!</b>&ldquo;</p>

<p><p>So now <em>I</em> was born in the old century, I mean in the 19s.  Well, in
a few hours but yeah!</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>At work today I installed Win NT 4.0 into one of the three machines.
Had a little bit of frustration, but I think I got it all down now.</p>

<p><p>First problem was I couldn&rsquo;t get it to recognize the new DMA66 IDE
drive it has.  Turns out Win NT doesn&rsquo;t know about this new thing, so I
had to install the driver from a separate disk.  That only took a few
tries to figure out.</p>

<p><p>Then when I got it installed I recognized I had created &ldquo;too many&rdquo;
partitions on the hard drive.  I had created 3 partitions, which threw
off the default drive letterings for the network drives.  Tried to
reinstall the OS to fix it, but realized I just had to use Disk
Administrator.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>One down, three to go!</p>

<p><p>- - - -</p>

<p><p>Fred and I are now at Wende&rsquo;s, about to go play on his unicycle and
stuff.  Y2K downtown on skates tonight!!!!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>
