      <description>23:03 Wednesday 30 May 2018 JST On Wednesdays, I wake up at 5am and leave the house at 5:45am so I can get on a train that arrives in Noborito at 6:29am but leaves Noborito at 6:57am. That gives 58 minutes of sleeping time on the train including both waiting and riding to Kawasaki.
Then lesson in Solid Square with Ayano, Takato, Yohei, Ai, and I talking about reasons we (dis)like certain months or seasons.</description>

      <description>##18:24 Tuesday 10 February 2015 JST##
Today I had three more hours of lessons than I normally have on Tuesdays. In addition to Akabanebashi and Mutsumis, I taught at Toshiba near Kawasaki station. It worked out well because Lin took today off work and we got to chow lunch at Lazona after I finished at 2pm.
After lunch, we smooched and I headed to Ebisu to chill with Nate for a bit.</description>

Today was my first lesson in 赤羽橋, a station whose kanji I cannot really read yet, though I know each kanji individually if I read slowly.
The lesson is a beginner level lesson, though I think the article I brought was a bit too difficult for the level. I&amp;rsquo;ll bring an easier article next time.
Only two students: A on the left wearing a necklace made by her friend ten years ago, and A on the right with all his mobile devices.</description>
