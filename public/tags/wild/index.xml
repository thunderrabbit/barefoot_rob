      <description>Mark synchronistically got on the same train car as me and we had a great quick check-in. I was able to dump everything about work and computer things going unexpectedly, and he told me about a cool set of questions he found that may work well in our men&amp;rsquo;s circle.
We did not have long to hang out so just quick stories and then long wave bye as we had to go on separate trains in 代々木上原 station.</description>
