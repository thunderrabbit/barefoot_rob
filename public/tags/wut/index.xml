      <description>08:24 Thursday 31 May 2018 JST Keith Corrigan contacted me on FB, and I thought it was a fake account trying to lure money out of me, but now I am not so sure. I still have a guess that is the case, but it&amp;rsquo;s not as blatant as others I have seen.</description>

      <description>19:24 Wednesday 15 June 2016 JST Hi Rob. Please explain me how to make a link to open in a new tab. And how to add a link to an image.  Hmm. I think they have some people who know HTML at CB.</description>

      <description>17:57 Friday 18 December 2015 JST Today included working on Patreon site, the piece I&amp;rsquo;ve been calling &amp;ldquo;Three or more circles&amp;rdquo;, AB website, discussing CB app, doing dishes, doing laundry, taking a nap, and now headed to Jon&amp;rsquo;s for poker night. (rare for me!)
late Friday night lost all my monies by having a good feeling that I would win and went against Sam who went all-in near the end of the night.</description>
