Dude:
Rob - Fred called from magic mountain. he said that the 4-D coaster was kick ass. he said that he waited in line for 2.5 hrs and that the ride itself was 3 minutes long, and that it took 4 minutes just to swap seats when the coaster is done (only one coaster per track). he said that the top speed was 70-ish MPH. sounds kick ass, but 2.</description>

10:45 pm Saturday 29 May 1999
Wende and I went to Astroworld today to ride Serial Thriller. We spent the night at her house (since it&amp;rsquo;s closer to the park) and got up, bought bagels at Einstein&amp;rsquo;s and got to the Astroworld parking lot gate at 8:30 as it opened. They still had a secondary gate locked so we waited. We were the second car to arrive, but there were two lanes so we were beside them at least.</description>

STATE OF MY LIFE

Jason Fricke called me back on the morning of the Friday that Wende and I went to Six Flags over Texas. The short version is that he invited me to Australia with him for four months. Four months!!!??? Nope nope nope couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it, and turned him down altogether, but I thought about it and decided I could go for one month.</description>

Today Jen and I went to Astroworld!
She had never been to the park, and hasn&amp;rsquo;t ridden any coasters in quite a while, so we were both happy to go. First stop was by the Serial Thriller, where we took lots of pics of the construction. The ride looks supa phat; I&amp;rsquo;m more excited about it opening than I am about Star Wars!</description>

      <description>18 April 1999
On Friday the 17th, Wende and I drove to Dallas to visit Six Flags!! We actually left a tad later than we had hoped, plus made a stop by my dad&amp;rsquo;s to get my brother&amp;rsquo;s snail mail&amp;hellip; We got to Dallas area by like 9pm.
First stopped by my friend Carrie&amp;rsquo;s house to say HI. She had her friend Wendy over for a slumber party (small party). Carrie, Wendy, Wende and I all talked about whatever and watched Wendy ride her unicycle, and ate some of Wendy&amp;rsquo;s muffins (she had made 72 for a lunch thing at her work).</description>
