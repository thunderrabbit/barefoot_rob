<p>Dude:</p>

<p>Rob - Fred called from magic mountain.  he said that the 4-D coaster was kick ass.  he said that he waited in line for 2.5 hrs and that the ride itself was 3 minutes long, and that it took 4 minutes just to swap seats when the coaster is done (only one coaster per track).  he said that the top speed was 70-ish MPH.  sounds kick ass, but 2.5 hrs is a long time to wait.  :-)))</p>

<p>Rob:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessin&rsquo; the wait time at the new 4D coaster here is longer than that&hellip;.
Thanks for the update!</p>

<p>Fred:</p>

<p>yeah. basically, it was worth the wait, in the end.  the ride is very well designed, smooth as a baby&rsquo;s bottom, no jostling, no sudden changes from one element to the next (recall XLR-8), and very natural changes from, say, facing backward, flying inverted, track sideways, low-ish g&rsquo;s, to facing forward, scooping down and back up through a very high-g valley.</p>

<p>but i don&rsquo;t recommend trekking all the way to fuji-q just yet; wait a while, so the line will be less and they might be running more trains.  for instance, x has no braking sections, giving a maximum of 2 trains (3 if you can have one on the lift hill?) (see below).  yesterday, they had only one train of 7 cars, 4 per car, and a total turnaround time of 7 minutes, perhaps longer.  so while the published capacity is 1600 riders per hour, magic mountain was getting maybe 400, max. idiots.  one of the operators said there was only one train available! i pointed out the six cars sitting on the ground behind the station, and he said they were just parts.</p>

<p>i was unimpressed with magic mountain.  i have never seen a park more empty, nor more inefficiently run.  i mean, they had only one train on the damn track, despite the &ldquo;getting off&rdquo; place being different from the &ldquo;getting on&rdquo; place.  that is only one of several examples. another: they had a &ldquo;fast pass&rdquo; for $15 per 4 passes, where you go in the out door, and skip the line.  at some rides (tatsu) no one was even checking cause there were almost no &ldquo;fast passers&rdquo;, yet four
whole rows were reserved for &ldquo;fast pass&rdquo; only.  at one ride (psyclone?) the operator let in the passers (a 30-45 second delay) after the cars were full, but before she had checked the safety harnesses.  so every fast passer caused a thirty second delay for every single person in line.  this happened basically every train.
also, she wouldn&rsquo;t let me just go sit in an empty seat.</p>

<p>if i had it to do again, i would have ridden X first, before the park had time to fill, instead of saving it for last, and i would have gotten up sooner, in order to have had time to ride riddler&rsquo;s revenge, which, i think is a duplicate of one of my favorite rides, raptor, at cedar point.  (when i stopped by the first time, it was having trouble, and after i&rsquo;d waited so long for X, i couldn&rsquo;t wait for riddler&rsquo;s revenge.)</p>

<p>a final note: maybe it was the shitty park food, and maybe it was the lack of water, but i kind of felt increasingly nauseated during some of the rides. am i getting old, or out of practice?</p>

<p>oh yeah: if you ride tatsu, or a ride like tatsu, do not wear glasses.
but you probably knew that.</p>

                        <p class=note>(transcribed from my diary)</p>
<p class=date>10:45 pm Saturday 29 May 1999</p>

<p><p>Wende and I went to Astroworld today to ride Serial Thriller. We spent the night at her house (since it&rsquo;s closer to the park) and got up, bought bagels at Einstein&rsquo;s and got to the Astroworld parking lot gate at 8:30 as it opened.  They still had a secondary gate locked so we waited.  We were the second car to arrive, but there were two lanes so we were beside them at least.</p>

<p><p>More cars crowded behind us; some saw that the gates were locked and they left.  A dad and two kids were dropped off at the gate; we offered them a ride across the parking lot once the gates opened.  They thankfully accepted the offer so they and I all piled into the back of Wende&rsquo;s truck as we waited and chatted with them until 9am when the parking lot gates were opened.</p>

<p><p>The race was on.  Across the parking lot people drove; to the front gates of Astroworld people ran.  Wende and I ended up second in line in one of 6 or so lines.  At 9:35 we were let into the park, but again had to wait behind a security-guarded rope.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Jennifer&rdquo; was written on the security guard&rsquo;s nametag, and she boosted the energy by having us cheer and all kinds of wacky stuff.  I was totally into it; we were about to ride Serial Thriller.  She asked trivia questions about the park and let people go &ldquo;first&rdquo; if they knew the answers!!!  I knew lots of answers and even stumped her with a few, but for some reason I never got called forward.  I must say it was pretty frustrating; I had to take a zen-like approach and believe everything will happen as it should.  Apparently I was not to be called forward.</p>

<p><p>When it was time to let us in, a small miscommunication between the security guards (Dwayne said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go yet;&rdquo;  Jennifer waved for the group to go) and the crowd split for an instant then flooded toward the ride.  Another thing that was wack: there are train tracks for the Astroworld train just in front of the entrance.  Just as we approached, I joked, &ldquo;watch the crossing guards go down&rdquo;  and they did!!  With the train approaching, I was all, &ldquo;come on!&rdquo; and grabbed Wende&rsquo;s hand as we ducked under the arms with a few other peeps.  Wende and I ended up in line about 200 people back.</p>

<p><p>It was all good; we played Egyptian Rat Screw while waiting.  I got some cool closer-up shots of the ride as park security got to ride, park employees got to ride, then Jennifer&rsquo;s group got to ride.  The crowd cheered as we were allowed to move forward.</p>

<p><p>The line woulda taken only like 30 minutes, but we waited for the coveted front seats, so it took an extra 15 or so.  One thing that was cool for one girl:  she mosied (past tense of mosey) into the line for the third seat on the train.  She was riding alone, as was the guy in the front seat.  She got to join him in the front, while Wende and I still had like 14 people in front of us in line.  Amazing good timing for that girl.  (I hope she enjoyed the front)</p>

<p><p>Finally it was time.  I sat on the right hand side; I saw one point of the circuit where the right hand side flew higher and asked Wende for that side.</p>

<p><p>We left the station, up up up up up up up up up up up up up down down down (as the back of the train was still going up) then WHOOOOOSH!!!  I was singing and expressing joyful noises unto the coaster, mostly aware of everything the ride had to offer as I had studied each move it made while I was in line.  I had my hands up and my legs up like flying and having a great time until near the end, &ldquo;YAAAA!!  HOLY SHmoley my leg!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Nothing happened to my leg, but adrenaline surged through my system!  That was so close!!</p>

<p><p><blockquote>On Serial Thriller, the train is suspended below the track, allowing riders&rsquo; legs to dangle and swing freely about.  At one point, the tracks are essentially &ldquo;back to back.&rdquo;  The train passes just under this point, makes a short 270 degree turn (plus a half twist) and crosses just <em>above</em> the same point.  To make this all possible, the half twist flips the train upside down at the last possible second in the world.  Never before has a half twist procrastenated so carelessly.</blockquote></p>

<p><p>Sheer thrilldom that my leg was still there and <em>WOW</em> that seemed so close!!!  Gotta ride it again.  Gotta get some pics!!  I waited for the next train and got a picture of that point.  I don&rsquo;t think the picture quite captured the essence of the thrill, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><p>Back in line; this time we didn&rsquo;t play Egyptian Rat Screw, but met some high school youth from Corpus Christi.  We talked coasters and stuff during the 53 minutes in line.  This time we rode in the very back seat.  I sat on the right hand side again, but this time I took pictures.</p>

<p><p>Up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up WHOOOOSH!!!!!!  and I took a pic.  Shot after shot; I tried to keep the camera steady (the ride is super smooth for a coaster, but it&rsquo;s like trying to write neatly while in a car.  It may feel smooth, but the writing looks like crap.)  Picture picture picture.  In 45 seconds of ride, I took 11 pictures.  I even got a shot of the leg remover.</p>

<p><p>The ride over, I squiggled to get my camera hidden back in my pocket.  I did an okay job of it, and used my shirt to cover the rest.</p>

<p><p>Rode again.  (This time the line was a bit shorter)  Talked to some different people in line.  They had just moved to Houston from California, near Great America (not Great America in Chicago) where they have awesome coasters as well.  Anyway talk talk talk and the line was like 45 minutes and we rode about 4 seats from the back.</p>

<p><p>Wende rode on the right and I was back to singing and waving and stuff.  I even rode barefoot for the occasion.  Wende didn&rsquo;t get freaked at the leg thing, but I told her to ride in the front seat and see how she feels about it.</p>

<p><p>Tons of fun.</p>

<p><p>Wende had to pee, so we didn&rsquo;t get back in line.  The weather said &ldquo;fine&rdquo; and a big storm blew in and they quit running the ride about 10 trains after we got off.</p>

<p><p>We ate a chili cheese dog as crowds walked past us out of the park.  (I got a cheesy picture of Wende with chili and cheese on her face after I unhelpfully helped her have a bite.)  We soakingly rode Warp 2000, but it was pretty cold rain and not quite as enjoyable as other Astroworld rain experiences I&rsquo;ve had when I was in high school.  Warm deep puddles of water through which we could splash and slide and play.  Not today, so we went home.</p>

<p><p>Back toward the truck we walked barefootedly.  I put on my shoes and surfed down a grassy hill.  Fun fun fun.  I&rsquo;ll get the pictures developed soon.</p>

<h1 id="number-of-times-i-rode-it-today">= number of times I rode it today.</h1>

<p></pre></p>

<p><p>Does anyone have a laptop I can buy or that you wanna give me?  I&rsquo;d really enjoy writing my journal entries in the moment, at the park, instead of reconstructing the excitement a month later.</p>

<p><p><b>Six Flags Great America</b> greets its visitors with a big blue twisty loopy coaster to the left of the park entrance.  Seven inversions.  I counted them.  Wow.</p>

<p><p>I came to the park with Carina and Nate, who had brought me here and come with us, respectively.  I know Carina from YRUU, and Nate is a friend of hers from the Navy.  (Yes, this is Dane&rsquo;s sister Carina)</p>

<p><p>While in line, I commented on the coolness of the big blue twisty coaster.  &ldquo;What is the name of that ride?&rdquo;  Neither Carina nor Nate knew.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Shockwave&rdquo; came the answer from someone almost as excited as me. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not even the coolest coaster.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Whoah.</p>

<p><p>Of course, Raging Bull was all the rage today.  A brand new ride that boasts an underground tunnel and seventy three mile per hour first drop!!  I could see its maroon track with big orange supports through the trees.  It did look impressive.</p>

<p><p>Raging Bull, I was assured, was the superlative ride of the year.  A group of bouncing high schoolers vowed to head straight for the ride.  I boasted that they better run or get out of my way.</p>

<p><p>The gates opened; I zipped through the gate and ran toward the looming orange coaster, only to be stopped by the rope.  What???</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not 10 o&rsquo;clock yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Ack.</p>

<p><p>Before the park opened for real, we were packed like sardines behind an employee-guarded rope, waiting for 10 am.  I squoozed myself to the front of the crowd (not too difficult as I had been one of the first people in the park) and looked back for Carina and Nate.</p>

<p><p>They finally made it.  Turns out Nate&rsquo;s big Texan belt buckle had set off the alarms and he had to take it off to go through the metal detector.</p>

<p><p>Several minutes later (still before 10), &ldquo;Raging Bull is not going to be open this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Most of the excited crowd hadn&rsquo;t heard that the coaster was still sleeping and wouldn&rsquo;t be ready.  I informed the bouncing high school group, who said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna wait in line anyway!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>As time grew near, many people in the crowd crowed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s 10 o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s 10 oh five!&rdquo; and others, but that didn&rsquo;t seem to help.</p>

<p><p>Finally a couple of other employees walked up.  They were all, &ldquo;OKAY!  DO NOT CROSS THE ROPE!   WE WILL LEAD YOU TO &lsquo;SOUTHWEST TERRITORY!&rsquo; RAGING BULL IS NOT OPEN!  DO NOT CROSS THE ROPE!&rdquo; kinda thing and they walked us like a giant amoeba to the Southwest Territory where all hell broke loose toward the Bull with me thinking, &ldquo;Where do I go????&rdquo;   Since I was not going to wait in line for a coaster that might not open today when tons of other rides were available.</p>

<p><p>A small black loopy thing was there, and I searched for its entrance.  I saw a group walking super fast.  &ldquo;Where is the entrance for this???&rdquo;   They guy told me, but added, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t get busy; Batman or Iron Wolf is better!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Perfect.  That is exactly what I wanted to know.  But where oh where is Batman?  &ldquo;Come with us; that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I lost Nate and Carina but they didn&rsquo;t want to walk as fast as me.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll find them later.</p>

<p><p>As we walked, I met my new friend Peter, and his brothers(?) and little sister Megan.</p>

<p><p>We actually rode Iron Wolf first.  It&rsquo;s a stand up ride, pretty compact and speedy, including a loop and other cool stuff.  Peter waited for the front car; I just rode the thing in first available seat.  Super nice ride, with some good drops and some head shaking.  Pretty zippy toward the ground at the end and overall I&rsquo;ll rate it 3.5 of 5.  They were running two trains, so there was no line when my ride ended so I rode again!  This time I moved to the back car.  I got 9 pics while on the ride.  I gotta get a digital camera.</p>

<p><p>Peter and crew waited for me (thank them very much), and we went to Batman.</p>

<p><p>We zipped through the turnstiles and only had to wait 5 trains to ride in the front seat!  Batman is a suspended looping coaster, 4 seats across.  Super awesome nice ride!  It has 2 loops and 3 corkscrews, all black track with beautiful though compact terrain with nice willow trees and a pond thing..  Wow!  Especially when right out of one twisty loop, we zip down for a near crash splash in the water.  (Choose the left hand seats on this ride; you get closer to the water, and better view of the crowd on the ground)</p>

<p><p>Oh oh oh! And I rode it barefoot!  yeah!</p>

<p><p>I give Batman The Ride a 4.5 of 5.  Very nice ride.  Choice: left hand side, front or back seat.</p>

<p><p>We rode it once, ran down the ramp, and the line was long as hell.  Cool.  Well, not cool, but cool that we didn&rsquo;t have to wait.</p>

<p><p>Now that the lines were long, we went to Shockwave, the big blue twisty thing near the front of the park.  I rode in the middle of the train with Meagan, Peter&rsquo;s sister.  I got several pics while waiting for the train, but zero while on it this time.</p>

<p><p>This ride is at least 3.5 of 5.  It&rsquo;s not as fast as the others, but long and tall and spindly, like Shockwave at Six Flags Over Texas.  Long curving entrance drop, then up up up into a tight loop.  Long curve again then two loops in a row.  Curve again and then a pretzel (two inversions) and back then around and two corkscrews in a row.  On a different time I rode Shockwave, I got a beautiful pic while on the corkscrew.  Looking through the corkscrew, perfectly framed is a US flag.  Nice nice nice.</p>

<p><p>Now, back at the park entrance, we had made one circuit of the park and began again toward Southwest Territory and Raging Bull.  The Bull was still closed, and Peter et.al. declared The Viper line was too long, so we rode Demon.</p>

<p><p>Demon is the loopy black coaster I had eyed first before finding Peter and gang.  This was is fun; it has big rocky terrain around it and even has a big loop around a rock arch thing.  Two loops then a tunnel and two corkscrews make this a fun ride.  I give it a 3 of 5 (2.5 without the terrain).  Great ride for beginners.</p>

<p><p>Now to the back of the park to ride American Eagle.  I got a pic of vacant turnstiles before the ride.  American Eagle is a big classic wooden coaster with twin tracks.  During Halloween season, the trains are run backwards.  The train is vibraty jiggly as hell and has a huge slow spiral acceleration track after the first big drop and answering ascent.</p>

<p><p>I got pictures on the ride, and casually put my camera in my lap when Peter said, &ldquo;camera ahead.&rdquo;  There&rsquo;s a camera taking pics of riders so the park might make a few extra dollars selling them at the end of the ride.</p>

<p><p>Classic wooden coasters are not my favorite; I love the speed, but this was nice; I give it a 3.5 or 4 of 5.</p>

<p><p>Peter and crew left.  The lines are long.  We rode all that before noon.</p>

<p><p>I meandered around the park after getting Peter&rsquo;s email address (haven&rsquo;t emailed him yet, but will after this entry is complete) and found myself on Iron Wolf.  The line is almost an hour long.  I rode near the back. Yay!!</p>

<p><p>Found Carina (actually she found me) near American Eagle.  They were munching messy chili dogs and nachos.  After food, we rode Cajun Cliffhangar, a ride that spins so riders are held against the wall while the floor drops out from below riders&rsquo; feet.  Big fun.  We got on there and Holli the ride op was on the intercom, &ldquo;welcome to Cajun Cliffhanger, please stay flat against the wall and &hellip;.  will you put your shoes back on please?&rdquo; she said to me.  :-)  The ride was fun, even while wearing shoes.</p>

<p><p>Nate and I chilled while Carina made a phone call.  She took a long ass time, so we went to ride Shockwave again.  I left her a note by the bench where we had been sitting.</p>

<p><p>The ride was great, and Carina was on a different bench.  She hadn&rsquo;t gotten the note.  I hopped over to where the other had been and some little junior high girls were all, &ldquo;are you Carina?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; I said, and they giggled and gave me the note.</p>

<p><p>I brought it back to Carina, who didn&rsquo;t want it, so I gave it back to the girls.  One was all, &ldquo;why would we want it?&rdquo;  Another piped up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We still rode more rides and I rode rides the next day.  But now, literally as I write this, Wende and I are off to Fiesta Texas to ride more coasters.  Maybe maybe I&rsquo;ll write more quickly!</p>

<p><p><b>STATE OF MY LIFE</b></p>

<p><p><ol></p>

<p><p><li>Jason Fricke called me back on the morning of the Friday that Wende and I went to Six Flags over Texas.  The short version is that he invited me to Australia with him for four months.  Four months!!!???  Nope nope nope couldn&rsquo;t do it, and turned him down altogether, but I thought about it and decided I could go for one month.  So the plan is for Jason and I to go to Australia(!!!) from 5 November to like 11 December 1999. More <a href="australia/index.html">here</a>.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I found a super cool applet composer by <a href="https://www.opencube.com">www.opencube.com</a> and I made a cool applet with it, but turns out that not all of them are free.  I&rsquo;ll have to pay $189 to get this applet on my site.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I lost my camera.  I had it after Six Flags over Texas, but not at Astroworld when we went last weekend.  Pooh.  I&rsquo;m taking Wende&rsquo;s tomorrow.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Tomorrow (actually today in 6 hours) I&rsquo;m going to fly to Chicago to attend Six Flags Great America!!!!!!!!  My friend Carina will pick me up from the airport and I&rsquo;ll crash at her crib and we&rsquo;ll check out the park Saturday and maybe Sunday.</li></p>

<p><p><li>Today I had fun at KTRU.  I played both sides of a 12 inch vinyl called something like &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; by Magilla Gorilla.  Cute and funny.  Also funny was when Side One ended, I played DJ Silver &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Panic&rdquo; and told listeners &ldquo;don&rsquo;t panic; I&rsquo;m turning the record over.&rdquo;  No one panicked.  No one even called during my shift.  &lsquo;Cept for Wende, but that doesn&rsquo;t count.</li></p>

<p><p><li>I just started my <a href="australia/index.html">Australia</a> pages. Now it&rsquo;s 2:40am.  I have to pack and leave my house in less than 4 hours.</li>

                        <p class=note>(written from notes in my little yellow diary that Bryn and Eryn gave me)</p>
<p class=date>1 May 1999</p>

<p><p>Today Jen and I went to Astroworld!</p>

<p><p>She had never been to the park, and hasn&rsquo;t ridden any coasters in quite a while, so we were both happy to go.  First stop was by the Serial Thriller, where we took lots of pics of the construction.  The ride looks supa phat; I&rsquo;m more excited about it opening than I am about Star Wars!  Jen decided she&rsquo;ll just have to come back this summer to ride it!</p>

<p><p>Our first stop was Viper, the line for which was pretty much super long. The wait didn&rsquo;t seem so long as we just talk talk talked.  Viper is super smooth and compact!  Including a loop and three circuits around the 1 or 2 acre area, Viper is the coolest coaster I know that could fit in my dad&rsquo;s yard!</p>

<p><p>I remember when it was first built (1989) and I was there on opening day.. Amazing!  I was so happy with the ride that I built a topologically accurate model of it out of posterboard.  The model is not all that amazing, except that my dad still has it in my old room closet.</p>

<p><p>Then toward XLR8, but the line was too long for me to want to ride it.  So to Greezed Lightnin&rsquo; we walked.  Soon as we got there, people were being turned back; ride was broke.  Doh!  So back to XLR8.</p>

<p><p>While we were in line for XLR8, the people who had been right in front of us on Viper exited XLR8.  They hadn&rsquo;t made a dead-end trip to Greezed Lightnin&rsquo;.</p>

<p><p>We rode in the front, which is pretty much the best seat on the train.  XLR8 is a suspended coaster, the first(?) of its kind.  Riders&rsquo; feet do not dangle like the newest suspended coasters, but it&rsquo;s still pretty fun to have the cars swing way out above the tall reeds.  I have heard rumors that XLR8 will be the next coaster to be replaced at Astroworld.</p>

<p><p>So anyway, we rode in front and then went to Greezed Lightnin&rsquo; again, since we saw it was running while we were on XLR8.</p>

<p><p>Soon as we got there, people were being turned back; ride was broke.  We decided to stay this time, waited for the crowd to disperse and walked up to nearly the front of the line for the back seats.  Met two guys in line, Carl and Brady, who were here from New Orleans.  Carl is a coaster enthusiast like me, but has ridden more rides than I, unlike me.  We talked rides and what&rsquo;s cool and whatever, and he told us about a new park being opened in New Orleans in Spring 2000.  <a href="https://www.jazzland2000.com" target="_new">Jazz Land</a> should be a pretty cool park!</p>

<p><p>Oh, I should certainly mention by now that Jen used to be a ride operator at <a href="https://www.canobie.com">Canobie Lake Park</a> up in New Hampshire. So she had some fun cool stories that neither Carl nor I had experienced.</p>

<p><p>Talking to the ride operator of Greezed Lightnin&rsquo;, turns out the brakes were not tight enough to stop the train properly, so they were tightening them.  It only took like 20 minutes, which is easily way less time than we would have spent waiting otherwise, plus now Jen and I had new friends!</p>

<p><p>Carl and Brady rode in the back, then Jen and I rode in the back, and the lines hadn&rsquo;t formed yet, so we rode again a couple seats up. Yay!  Greezed Lightnin&rsquo; is a basic shuttle loop coaster, catapults out of station, loops, goes up a hill, then backwards through loop, back through station, up a hill, then back down again into station.  35 seconds at most.</p>

<p><p>Carl and Brady waited for us at the exit, and Jen saw that Texas Tornado was running!!  With riders!!  We had previously skipped this latest newest greatest ride because it wasn&rsquo;t open (though there was a significant line).</p>

<p><p>So at super high speed walk we zipped over to the ride and talk talk talked while waiting.  Carl talked a lot about the cool rides at Six Flags Great America, and I was quite ecstatic to think I would be there next week!  Amazing!  We couldn&rsquo;t think of the name of the newest biggest ride there, but yeah, lots to talk about.</p>

<p><p>Waited for Texas Tornado (it used to be named after the Looney Toons character: Taz&rsquo;s Texas Tornado, and I inquired about the change.  &ldquo;Did you lose a license with Looney Toons to use the name?&rdquo;  &ldquo;No, they decided not to use a name that would scare little kids,&rdquo; was the reply from a ride operator.  &ldquo;What????&rdquo;) and Jen took some primo pics of it while we were in line.</p>

<p><p>While in line, I showed them how at one point in the track, as the train is just finishing a loop, the track moves to accomodate the mass and literally shakes the ride operator booth!  We loved watching the booth go shakeshakeshake as the train whoooshed by. Coincidentally, at that moment in the track, a camera takes pictures of everyone on the train.  The pictures were offered for sale for like $7 as people left.</p>

<p><p>Finally it was our turn to ride.  Jen and I rode the front seat of the last car.  This seat is often one of my favorites; I get the thrill of being in the last car, but a get a good view by being in a front seat.</p>

<p><p>The ride is awesome.  Up the curved incline to begin, then a false start then, zzzooooommmmm so incredibly steep curved down immediately through two loops.  Then up through a braking section then zzzoooomm down again through a cork screw, then around and up and down and another cork screw right where our pictures are taken, I pointed at the ride op booth, screamed, &ldquo;SHAKE BABY SHAKE!!&rdquo; and then around one more shaky banked curve then slow then done.</p>

<p><p>WOW!!!   I love that ride!  Waved to the crowd in line, waved to the people in the station, the ride ops, everyone.  I love it!</p>

<p><p>I checked out the picture for sale.  I look possessed, pointing over at the booth, shouting something crazy.  Bought it.</p>

<p><p>Waited for Brady and Carl to ride, then walked toward Batman The Ride.  They had already ridden, so they went to eat and we parted ways.  I got Carl&rsquo;s email address, so I&rsquo;ll write him when this entry is done.</p>

<p><p>The line for Batman was super long; we had to wait through almost the entire themed area, the Penguin&rsquo;s Arctic Park, then through construction and disarray of Gotham City, all privately funded by Mr Cobblepot.</p>

<p><p>Front car of Batman is an absolute must.  I don&rsquo;t care in which seat I ride, but I have to ride in front after waiting all that time to ride.  The train is about 7 cars long, 4 seats across per car.  Hugely careening through the track this train sounds like a jet almost.  It&rsquo;s amazing.  Out of the station up the click click click, I pulled out my cell phone to call Wende. No answer. I tried both her numbers and pretty much used up about half the ride listening to the phone ring.  That was cool.  Worth the irony of having been able to shout, &ldquo;GUESS WHAT??? WE&rsquo;RE ON BATMAN!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Too bad she didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>

<p><p>After Batman, we rode Ultra Twister.  The line was super long, but I wanted to ride so Jen could experience it.  Talking with Jen and taunting back and forth with two kids (they started it by tapping on my shoulder as they went by, then pretending not to have done it) helped the line waiting experience.</p>

<p><p>Got on, and the car began its ascent <em>click click click click click click click CLUNk</em> we stopped.</p>

<p><p>Jen and I were in the front seat, behind us were two adult types, behind them (last seat) were two kids affiliated in some manner with the two adults.</p>

<p><p>The kids asked worriedly, &ldquo;why are we stopped?&rdquo;  &ldquo;is there something wrong?&rdquo;  &ldquo;when will we go again?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>None of these were questions that could be very well answered, so we made up delicously vague or teasingly scary answers.  Eventually, it became apparent that &ldquo;soon&rdquo; was not the correct answer to any of these questions except maybe, &ldquo;when will someone come see us?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Jeremy came to see us.  A ride op for Ultra Twister, he said basically, &ldquo;the chain stopped, we&rsquo;ll get it going in a little bit.  Hopefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Another ride op climbed the steps to tell the same thing to the people stopped at the top of the lift.</p>

<p><p>We joked back and forth and then I was all, &ldquo;hey hey hey can you go get Jen&rsquo;s camera so we can take a picture of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We told him where it was and he got it and Jen took a pic of the people above us.</p>

<p><p>Uh-oh.  Wende!  We were late to meet her!  I pulled out my cell phone and called her.  &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Where are you??&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on Ultra Twister.  Stuck on Ultra Twister to be precise..&rdquo;  I told her how to come to the entrance of Batman where she would be able to see us.  We waved back and forth once she got there and I called her again.  &ldquo;Hey, if we give you Jen&rsquo;s camera, will you take a picture of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Negotiating how to get her the camera, then actually getting it to her, then having Wende get back to her spot, and teaching her how to use the camera (manual), took longer than it took for us to get unstuck.  No picture.</p>

<p><p>Oh well.</p>

<p><p>The ride was great, with its ups and downs and twists, starts and stops, fowards and backwards, but no turns.</p>

<p><p>We were greeted by Wende at the end.  Oh!  and there&rsquo;s our friends who we were teasing with in line.  &ldquo;You got stuck on it??&rdquo; they asked wide eyed.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; I said proudly.  &ldquo;Have a great day!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Then we went to Looping Starship.  This is a ride that gripped Wende&rsquo;s heart, mind, body with great fear.  She had her reasons, and they were understandable, but I encouraged, taunted, begged, consoled, whatever it took to get her to ride it.</p>

<p><p>I love the ride.  I let my leg dangle down while we were upside down, and a couple of people in line waved to me.  Great fun.</p>

<p><p>Afterward Wende said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s something I would do again.  I enjoyed it, and it was probably not worth all my boycotts for all those years.  But it&rsquo;s scarier than a roller coaster to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Then, the ultimate.  We debated for a while, &ldquo;should we pay the extra money?  well, we&rsquo;re already here.  won&rsquo;t get many chances to do it.  but it&rsquo;s $45. do we have enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The Barnstormer is a ride where they wrap riders in big cloth tamales, tie them to a cable, pull them up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up, then the riders drop and SWWWWOOOSSHHHHH way down and SWIIINNNGGG way up and it&rsquo;s a thrill.  I&rsquo;ve never done it.</p>

<p><p>We did it. The line was short but took a long time. While Jen and Wen waited, I went and bought ice cream for me and Jen, a pretzel for Wende.  I finished my ice cream before I had gotten Wende&rsquo;s pretzel so I bought an ice cream sandwich or something there.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hurry!  Hurry!!&rdquo;  they were calling as I got back.  We hogged down the food and got wrapped in tamales.  Actually they were like big complicated smocks with leg straps and foot holders. We went down the walkway to wait a tad longer before our time to fly.</p>

<p><p>In front of us were a couple of high school-ish aged youth, including one named Marlin who was super duper nervous about the whole thing.  Wende was totally sympathetic; they made nervous jokes and stuff while I just stood excitedly watching everything.</p>

<p><p>When it was their turn, we cheered them on as they were strapped to the cable in their tamales.  Up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up they went higher higher higher with Marlin yelling gentle obscenities the whole way.</p>

<p><p>Once they reached the top, the ride op person spoke over the intercom, &ldquo;fliers ready; 3 - 2 - 1 - fly&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>And one of them pulled the little cord and they dropped.  Marlin yelled.  They flew past us, flew up, flew back&hellip;  the biggest coolest swing in the world and they were swinging big.</p>

<p><p>Marlin quit yelling frightenedly and yelled triumphantly!  &ldquo;YEEEAAAHHAHAHAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!&rdquo;  We cheered him on.</p>

<p><p>They finished, got off the swing, we got on and exactly the same thing happened except it was Wende instead of Marlin.</p>

<p><p>Going up, I was being all teasing and Wende almost cried. I felt bad, but a bit gyped since she didn&rsquo;t let me put my arms out.  I could have, but man when she cried I figured she was really scared.</p>

<p><p>We kept going up, and I got a tad nervous. Wow ..  we&rsquo;re getting pretty high up here..  We stopped at the top.  Now I know what 173 feet feels like.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;3 - 2 - 1 - fly&rdquo; and we dropped.</p>

<p><p>Wow.</p>

<p><p>From 0 to 70 at 9.8 meters per second squared and we missed the ground by 10 feet as we flew up over the water and back down and up and down and wow.  I yelled triumphantly, Jen did her Tarzan impression, and Wende enjoyed it after recognizing she was still alive.</p>

<p><p>Totally like flying we swung for as long as possible; I tried to hold the girls&rsquo; hands back so we wouldn&rsquo;t catch the rope they used to slow us down.  So much fun.</p>

<p><p>Then to the Texas Cyclone where the line was long but bearable after all the excitement, though my legs were pretty tired after standing up all day.  I rode in the first seat in the back car and Wen and Jen rode together after that.  It was fully dark outside, so a fun ride watching the lights.  I honestly don&rsquo;t remember much about it, but I know I yelled happily and held my hands up high.</p>

<p><p>Waited for Wen and Jen and then we rode Dungeon Drop.  This is a ride that simply takes riders straight up and drops them straight down for about 2.5 seconds of freefall.  Maybe 2 seconds.</p>

<p><p>The park was closing so we were ushered toward the exit.  What a super duper fabulous fun day!</p>

                        <p class=date>18 April 1999</p>

<p><p>On Friday the 17th, Wende and I drove to Dallas to visit Six Flags!!  We actually left a tad later than we had hoped, plus made a stop by my dad&rsquo;s to get my brother&rsquo;s snail mail&hellip; We got to Dallas area by like 9pm.</p>

<p><p>First stopped by my friend Carrie&rsquo;s house to say HI.  She had her friend Wendy over for a slumber party (small party). Carrie, Wendy, Wende and I all talked about whatever and watched Wendy ride her unicycle, and ate some of Wendy&rsquo;s muffins (she had made 72 for a lunch thing at her work).  I tried out the unicycle a bit and did relatively well.</p>

<p><p>Then off to my brother&rsquo;s house, fully on the other side of Dallas.  Carrie lives in Mesquite; Fred lives in Denton.  Got to his place at like midnight, and he was up studying some crazy math stuff.  (He&rsquo;s getting a doctorate degree in math at like Stanford or something) We said HI to him then went to see his friend Tamara who was doing security dispatch stuff graveyard shift.</p>

<p><p>Then slept.</p>

<p><p>(I&rsquo;ll tell the story faster)
<br>(note: several of the coasters listed are linked on <a href="https://www.sixflags.com/texas/rides/">Six Flags</a> site.  This site requires the Shockwave Flash plugin)</p>

<p><p>Got to Six Flags by 10am, though they opened at 9.  Oh well.  I had never been before.  Wende had been, but it was a super long time ago and she didn&rsquo;t totally remember the layout of the park. So map in hand I searched out Flashback, but ended up near two different coasters: Mr Freeze, and Batman The Ride.  Mr Freeze was not currently working and Batman was not completely built. Some people nearby were all, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go to Flashback!&rdquo;  We followed.</p>

<p><p>Flashback is cool.  It starts by pulling the train backwards up an incline then dropping it back through the station and through a couple of twisty inversions, a proper loop and then up another hill.  The train is pulled forward further up the hill then dropped backwards through the whole thing again.  Awesome.  I got some pics, but didn&rsquo;t get to sit in the front seat; I was a tad bummed about that.</p>

<p><p>Walked toward Shockwave and found the Mine Train. Wende said it was the first tubular steel coaster in the world!  It&rsquo;s a pretty cute little ride, similar but a tad longer and squatter than Excalibur was at Astroworld.  I got pictures while riding it, including some shots of different coasters in the park.</p>

<p><p>Then to Shockwave.  It&rsquo;s a tall gangly sort of ride, quite spread out over a several acre site.  Alongside a highway (I-30?), two loops kick off the action, and then some wild dips and various twists and turns.  I got some pictures while waiting in line.  After riding, someone asked how it was. I said, &ldquo;pretty good!  Better than it looks!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>We continued our trek around the park and found Texas Giant. It&rsquo;s a pretty huge wooden coaster, 14 stories tall with a top speed of just over 60mph.  My brother had said it wasn&rsquo;t that great, that I should skip it. We rode anyway, and I certainly enjoyed it.  Just as the ride began, I recognized I was out of film.  Doh!!  So no pics while on that ride, but I got a few after we rode.  The thing is so tall that I found it difficult to get a good shot.</p>

<p><p>Then to Casa de las Banderas for lunch.  We got supreme nachos and cheese for inflated amusement park price and chilled for about half an hour.</p>

<p><p>La Vibora (&ldquo;The Viper&rdquo; in Spanish) was next on our list. It&rsquo;s a bobsled coaster thing.  Is it a coaster?  Is it a sled? It&rsquo;s something that was pretty fun: sleds with wheels rolling down a trough. Like a water slide with no water.</p>

<p><p>At this point we had essentially ridden each coaster on the outer perimeter of the park, so we were back at the entrance. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go try Mr Freeze again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>This we did, and this time it was open. The line was longer than it first appeared; the architects had done a sneaky job of weaving the line around where it couldn&rsquo;t be seen from other parts of the line.  Through turnstiles we went, then the line appeared to go out 1 door and immediately back in an other door. Outside the door was another set of turnstiles.</p>

<p><p>While outside, we had a good view of the coaster. It started out flat and was accelerated to 70mph and then straight UP, 90 degree twist, then 180 degree loop, 90 degree untwist, straight DOWN, then a big lazy loop thing then straight UP right between the original UP and DOWN.  Magically the train is pulled higher at this last UP and then is dropped backwards and does the whole thing backwards!!</p>

<p><p>The entire ride lasts 40 seconds.</p>

<p><p>I was intrigued by how the train is silently magically lifted at the end (middle) and by how quickly the train would rocket back out of the station again, full of new people.</p>

<p><p>I ignored how quickly the train was emptied and refilled, but pondered the lift.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;OH wait!!!&rdquo;  I remembered.  The train has silver metal fin things on each side. Electromagnets lift it, and electromagnets achieve the initial acceleration and the final deceleration!!!  Phat!!!!</p>

<p><p>Once we got back inside, there was plenty of line left, but thankfully no turnstiles.  As we got closer to the beginning of the line, we noticed an odd thing: for some reason, after waiting for some minutes, a huge gap would appear in line, bubbling backwards to the end.  &ldquo;Are people just gawking and not paying attention????&rdquo;  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>And then the ultimate intrigue: the line hits a wall and splits.  Which way to go?  No indication is given on which way is best or what. Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>We had been talking with a mom and her two kids, like 10 and 14 years old and we chose left since the 14 year-old said it was faster.  Fair enough.  It wasn&rsquo;t faster; the right hand line started pouring people through it.  That explained the huge gaps in line, but what was back there???</p>

<p><p><b>Wow</b></p>

<p><p>We got around the corner and I was amazed.  Two trains were side by side, each on its own track.  The tracks could move independently side to side.  The one train would be on one track and move over to the side to drop off passengers and pick up a new set of riders.  During that time, the other train would have been moved to the center for launch.</p>

<p><p>Launch. &ldquo;Launch&rdquo; precisely describes this action.  The ride operator in charge of pushing &ldquo;go&rdquo; would say, &ldquo;all clear. Train is being launched,&rdquo; hit the button, and with a significant dimming of the lights and huge amperage transformers engaging, ZZZZHZZHZHZHShshshshshsshshsoooooom the train would blast out of the station, 0 to 70mph in 4 seconds.  Oh yes.  Launch.</p>

<p><p>Forty seconds later the train would blast back into the tunnel and park gently on its track, which would then move over to the other side and do the passenger thing as the other train did the launch thing.</p>

<p><p>The process was amazing. The dimming of the lights, the speed, the amperage&hellip; incredible. Plus, when the lights were on, they filled the room with cool blue light to accentuate the name Mr Freeze. 1.5 hours in line for a 40 second ride. I loved it!</p>

<p><p>Wende had expressed interest in riding The Texas Chute Out, so we went there next.  It&rsquo;s the parachute ride thing.  Just slowly up and slowly straight back down, so nothing amazing, but I was able to get some good arial pics of Mr Freeze, Batman The Ride and Flashback.</p>

<p><p>Rode Judge Roy Scream.  Tee hee.  That was cute.  I enjoyed how the ride ran parallel to a road, about the same speed as traffic. I took pictures of the car beside us. (I think I got it)</p>

<p><p>Then a 3-D movie thing called Escape from Dino Island, a takeoff from Michael Crighton&rsquo;s Jurassic Park.  It was interesting, but not worth the wait.</p>

<p><p>At Dryer&rsquo;s Ice Cream place I grabbed a Sprite and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough float.  Wende got a cone something.</p>

<p><p>There were only 3 coasters left: that which used to be called Cliff Hanger (I don&rsquo;t remember what it&rsquo;s called now, but it&rsquo;s the L shaped freefall ride), Mini Mine Train (a smaller version of Mine Train), and Runaway Mountain (a totally enclosed coaster).</p>

<p><p>I had been on Sky Screamer, Astroworld&rsquo;s version of Cliff Hanger, so I didn&rsquo;t care about doing that again. Mini Mine Train was too small, so we went to Runaway Mountain. At Astroworld there is Mayan Mindbender, which is enclosed, but not tremendously crazy. I didn&rsquo;t expect much more from Runaway Mountain.</p>

<p><p>The line was super long, but that allowed me to finish my float (without using a spoon, so I had to be careful to keep it from getting all over my face..).  There was a super attractive girl in front of us in line.  She reminded me of the blonde character in the cartoon Foxtrot (not Paige, but the straight haired blonde at school)</p>

<p><p>I got some pictures within the ride, all dark and scary and <em>FLASH!!</em> my camera would flash suddenly.  I tried to anticipate where to point it so I would photograph track; I was successful twice I think.</p>

<p><p>I was impressed with how swervy the ride was. It&rsquo;s better than Mayan Mindbender at Astroworld.</p>

<p><p>Got some pizza and chilled for a bit.  My legs really really felt sore from standing all day.</p>

<p><p>Time to go.</p>

<p><p>Wait.  no.  Let&rsquo;s go see if the Mr Freeze line is shorter this time.  It was, so we rode it again.  We waited less than an hour this time, but still longer than I would have waited if I lived in Dallas and could come to the park anytime.</p>

<p><p>We chose the right hand side when the line split, and I was still super thrilled with how the whole thing was set up. I can just imagine the same technology in a ride like 3 times as long that doesn&rsquo;t have to essentially stop at each lift.
It&rsquo;s like ZZZZZzoooommmmmmmmmm going going going slower slower zzzzzz &hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;. then suddenly ZZZZZZZZZZZZZoooooooommmmmmmmm!!</p>

<p><p>Amazing.  I loved it again.</p>

<p><p>It was 9pm as we were leaving the park.  We had been there 11 hours.  It was fully 10pm by the time we had gotten gas in Wende&rsquo;s truck and were fully out of town.</p>

<p><p>I drove for like 2 hours, till I just couldn&rsquo;t stay awake anymore.  Loud music, loud talking, jokes.. nothing was working. Wende had slept some so she drove starting at midnight.</p>

<p><p>I woke up after 3 am; we were parked in a Kroger parking lot in Huntsville.  Wende had driven an hour until she couldn&rsquo;t drive anymore.</p>

<p><p>I drove the remaining hour or so home.  Back in Houston by 4:22am.  Church in 6.5 hours.</p>

<p><p>Wow. What a great trip!!!!</p>

<p><p>I emailed my brother some of the same stuff.  Here&rsquo;s part of his reply:</p>

<pre>
<em>- Shockwave was better than it looked.</em>
Yeah, at first you think, "Please.  Only two loops?"  When I rode it
a few years ago, I made Tamara and Bill follow me right back into
line.  

<em>- 1.5 hours in line for 40 second ride.</em>
There's a lesson in supply and demand.

<em>- Imagine that ride like 3 times as long, and it doesn't have to slow
- down for the next lift, it's like ZZZZZzoooommmmmmmmmm going going
- going slower slower zzzzzz ....... ....
- ZZZZZZZZZZZZZoooooooommmmmmmmm!!</em>
Soon, soon.
