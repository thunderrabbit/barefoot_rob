      <description>Hide and Akiko from 7pm class each needed to make up some lessons, so stayed for the 8pm class featuring Misato and Tatsuya.
I think it worked pretty well; they had not met each other, and they are all pretty much similar personalities so I figured they would get along fine.
After self intros, most of the time they talked about Akiko&amp;rsquo;s challenging business trip to Hydrabad, India. Most of the rest of the time we talked about Hide&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>
