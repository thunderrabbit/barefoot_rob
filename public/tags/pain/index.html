<p class=date>am Monday 27 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>The same night after Jessica hit her head and we sent her to bed, Elizabeth (an advisor) asked if I would shave the back of her head with my clippers.  No problem!

<p>I clipped it as she requested and was walking in the dark toward the bushes to throw it away when 
<font size="+3" color="FF0000"><em>BAM!!</em></font> something clamped onto my toe and burning poison seared through like red hot electrocuting pliers biting through OHMYGOD that hurts get-it-off-get-it-off and I scraped my foot upside down to knock off whatever animal had so effectively stung me DAMN!!

<p>Back to the lighted area and nothing was on my foot, nor had been when I scraped it but oh my god my second smallest left toe screamed with agony.

<p>Amazed, I walked over to Arlene and Steve. Limping did not help; the pain ripped through me anyway. "Hi. Um, I got stung my something on my foot, and it really really hurts."

<p>Bix, Rafael, and Charlotte were quite loving and attentive as I sat wide eyed on the bench, repeating, "this pain is amazing," as Bix offered her hand for me to squeeze.  As other youth found out, they asked about my foot and gave consolations.

<p>Soon, the lymph node inside my left thigh began to hurt, and my lips began to tingle as my toe and foot were tingling. Wow. 
In describing the pain to someone, and given the injury and stuff, it was determined I had been stung by a scorpion.

<p>Limped to bed (okay maybe it did help) and Wende brought my pillow and stuff. I slept through the night to 8am, missing my 4am-8am roving shift. Thank you, other advisors.
