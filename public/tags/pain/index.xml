      <description>SWUUSI
am Monday 27 July 1998
transcribed from my diary The same night after Jessica hit her head and we sent her to bed, Elizabeth (an advisor) asked if I would shave the back of her head with my clippers. No problem! I clipped it as she requested and was walking in the dark toward the bushes to throw it away when BAM!! something clamped onto my toe and burning poison seared through like red hot electrocuting pliers biting through OHMYGOD that hurts get-it-off-get-it-off and I scraped my foot upside down to knock off whatever animal had so effectively stung me DAMN!</description>
