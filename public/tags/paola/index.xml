      <description>20:20 Saturday 23 September 2017 JST Today was the first time for Paola and Jon to come visit our house since we moved last summer. Lovely time including delicious salmon quiche, indian graham crackers (my name), plum pie, and two different salads. Oh, and we played the ball game that I do not have a name for yet, but which I got from the shop in Harajuku. Everyone played and enjoyed it!</description>

      <description>23:57 Tuesday 12 September 2017 JST Just got home via taxi with Lin after eating ice cream with her near our station. I got Ben and Jerry&amp;rsquo;s cotton candy (which was similar to Baskin Robbin&amp;rsquo;s Popping Shower), and she got cherry by some other premium brand, the name of which escapes me now.
Lin and I took the same train from Noborito to our station. She had gotten on near Shinjuku, and we did not specifically plan to take the same train, but it worked out that way.</description>
