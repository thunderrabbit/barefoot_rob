                        <p>##07:12 Monday 16 June 2015 JST##</p>

<p>Playing silent football, with Nick and Laura D, they kept footballing to each other and then Nick sent it to me and expected me to send it to her, so I made a big show of finding a way to measure the distance to her: I searched in my pockets for a measuring device and found a short length of string and began to measure the distance to her, but it was more than 5 string lengths to get just to the next person so I dramatically tossed it over my shoulder and pulled out a pantomime string and measure one unit for each person away, and determined that Laura was in fact 4 people away from me.  I pantomimed the fwaps to get the ball there and realized that I couldn&rsquo;t because 3 was less than 4, so I shrugged like &ldquo;I have no idea how to do it!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nick sent the football to Laura with a zoom and then a bit later a few hands went up, even though I didn&rsquo;t see an error.  There was a new component to the game: lawyers, who would speak on behalf of their clients.  The hands hadn&rsquo;t just gone up to tattle, but to solicit clients on whose behalf the lawyers could speak.</p>

<p>Then someone showed me some paper with notes written back and forth on it.  I scanned through it but couldn&rsquo;t make much sense of it, so a person next to me (who knew the two people who had written the note) read it to me, using their Jamaican accents, which I don&rsquo;t know if they did naturally or dramatically.  She commented the not actually made some sense if you knew the guys, but their blatant disregard for standardized grammar was a bit challenging to read.</p>

<p>Oh, there was one other new component of the game: message encoding.  People could articulate a certain number of fwaps to be applied from the position of the person to whom they next passed the football by any other means.  It was essentially moving the football twice, and could be a way to pass messages between universes, I realized.</p>

<p class=date>31 October 1999</p>

<p><p>After dropping off youth at church, I went home, showered, picked up my friend Nancy and went to Molly&rsquo;s Halloween Simpson&rsquo;s party!</p>

<p><p>Marcel and Kayse were there!  Big hugs to him (and dainty hug to her) Also John, Maggie, Eric, Meredith, Melanie, Steve, Nancy, my Nancy, and Kerry.</p>

<p><p>Apple bobbing contest was great fun!  Boys against girls and we won barely! Steve was pretty slow and I was pretty fast to make up. Marcel was our anchor and we barely won!  Nancy filmed, Nancy watched, Meredith took pictures, and the rest of us got soaked and had great fun!</p>

<p><p>Inside for video games (Sega) and then Silent Football!  I was super excited to play since we didn&rsquo;t play at the rally.  We didn&rsquo;t play too long and probably that was for the best because we had new players, but afterward they were all, &ldquo;I had more fun than expected!&rdquo;  Awesome.</p>

<p><p>Watched Trick-or-Treaters and Simpson&rsquo;s Halloween Specials.</p>

<p><p>Wende called during the evening and I got to talk to her some!</p>

<p><p>Watched X-Files (I was anti-impressed) and then Nancy and I left.  Dropped her off at her house and I went home and wrote this entry.</p>
