<p>Today Lin and I drove to Travis and Yumi&rsquo;s place to hang out with them
and Sakura.  Johan was already there and Deji came a bit later.  Nice
to see everyone again, though in some ways it&rsquo;s like the tribe is
getting smaller (and larger!)</p>

<p>No BBQ today due to rain, but we made 手巻き with chicken, eggs,
salad, and then ice cream at the end.</p>

<p>We laughed a lot, played with (funny) rubber balls, retrieved toys
from under the sofa set, and had a great time.</p>

<p>Peeps were ready to leave by the time I had to leave to get to men&rsquo;s
circle on time tonight, so Lin drove us to the station.  Driving a car
takes (unpredictably) longer than taking a train, so I took a train.</p>

<p>Deji and I sat on Yokohama line for a bit, talking about what racism
actually means.  He made a distinction between &ldquo;pre judging&rdquo; (making
predictions about someone) and &ldquo;prejuduce&rdquo; (assuming superiority over
someone).</p>

<p>Saw Miyu briefly tonight at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Apocrypha/events/253866470/">Apocrypha #17, a trip to remember</a>.  Met Sabrina who I thought was
courageous for the story she told about her family.  This was Isaac&rsquo;s
second event, and it went really well.  Yumi told a story about a
transformative experience she had, which sounded to me like it could
be a mixed gender version of Mankind Project.  Chelsea&rsquo;s story also
seemed courageous, regarding personal struggles while on vacation.
Oh, and Yuji&rsquo;s long story was worth it.  I could not have really cut
anything either.</p>

<p class="dream">Walking outside, I realized I was wearing hiking
boots and was shocked that I was wearing them while walking around on
vacation.  I asked store owner if I could have a bag to put them in,
but he said he could not give me one, but I could not understand the
reason why.  I walked further and found a place to put my boots in a
locker so I did that and saw Yumi there who taking things out of her
locker and she said I could put my shoes with her stuff with kinda the
implication that her son would be able to wear them when he got older.
That's fine with me and I was glad to be barefoot again, but I
wondered if I would really never need them in the next 15 years; I do
wear them in winter sometimes!</p>

<div class="dream">I had a schedule conflict that I detected a few
days out, but didn't try to rectify until the day of the conflict.
Nate wanted to have me join a late night adventure sneaking into a
dark house that only I knew the layout to find some prize close to
midnight.</div>

<div class="dream">I was more interested in joining Lin to meet Travis
and Yumi for a roadtrip that started at 11pm, but planned to meet in
nearly the same location, an empty field next to the building that
Nate and I were going to explore in the dark.</div>

<div class="dream">I was more interested in joining Lin and Travis
because they wanted me to join because of me, and Nate wanted me to
join because of what I could do.</div>

<div class="dream">I decided I had to call Nate, so I found my phone
and my earphones and plugged them into the phone and into my ears.  I
called him while walking around a mall near a train station, going up
and down escalators and was like</div>

<div class="dream">"Hey yo I gotta leave early tonight like
midnight,"</div>

<div class="dream">and he goes "Why?"</div>

<div class="dream"> Which is a question I had not really anticipated.
I told him why and he seemed to understand because he repeated back
what I said.  I was like yep and he started to negotiate as I walked
down an escalator barefoot and turned right after I saw some people go
down a vertical elevator thing like in a parking garage I saw where
the staff could use the elevator chains that just continuously cycled.
I was surprised that I didnt want to take that but instead took the
escalator, thinking next time I would take the elevator chain.</div>

<p>I woke up quite relieved that there was no schedule conflict..</p>
