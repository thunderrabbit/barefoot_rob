      <description>15:53 Friday 28 July 2017 JST On my way to Gunma today, I stopped by Joanna&amp;rsquo;s to install a ceiling fan which she had ordered. She took me to a restaurant which served everything on (round) tortillas with the sides folded to make them square.
Great to see her again and hear about how things have been going! Been a long time since The Artist&amp;rsquo;s Way back in the day.</description>
