      <description>20:29 Tuesday 28 June 2016 JST My computer&amp;rsquo;s kernel_task was hogging the CPU at 700% usage so I emailed Lantz and he was able to take a look at it today. Turns out it was just dirty, including having something stuck in the fan keeping it from running properly.
Well! I can hardly blame Apple for that, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad I was able to get it fixed (plus receive a five point driver that can drive the Pentalobe screws) without paying them.</description>

      <description>16:18 Wednesday 22 June 2016 JST After finishing the piece (though I haven&amp;rsquo;t written its title on the back), I walked toward the station. Got to the coast-hugging highway and looked left: &amp;ldquo;oh hmmm wait a minute that looks like an shopping outlet that just might have some nice bags.&amp;rdquo;
So I walked over that way and saw a trampoline across the street from the piace (would be great for a few free bounces, but they wanted 300 yen and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to do 300 yen worth of flips).</description>
