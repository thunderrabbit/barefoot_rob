<p>I have been thinking about my morning routine.  Today I came upon a
grand idea to exercise each morning by walking around my local area
for perhaps 20 or 30 minutes on days that I do not have to leave at
5:45 in the morning.</p>

<p>Lin walked with me today, and we saw some interesting old (and not as
interesting new) houses in our neighborhood on streets I had never
previously used.  This could be a fun healthy adventure!</p>

<p>Had a quick meeting with Tariq this morning about
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi">ConSwi</a>.  At this point
there are 2
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues">open issues</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/2">#2</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/6">#6</a>) and Tariq will
adjust the size of the image which shows players to swipe pieces.</p>

<p>After writing this entry, I will go to SOGO for weekly workout and
after that join Lin at Chazu&rsquo;s house in town.</p>

<p>I bought a book that has become my todo book.  It&rsquo;s as portable as my
phone and even more reliable in terms of battery power.  I bought it
on Tuesday and have used it daily since then.  Wow four days in total.</p>

<p>So far I have used a single page per day.  (It&rsquo;s 91mm x 160mm x 6mm,
featuring 96 pages and two covers within the 6mm thickness.  It&rsquo;s
about the same size as my phone.)  If I keep going at the current
rate, (one side of paper per day,) it should last 6 months.</p>

<p>I wrote this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using Complice for a while and I am at a stage where I am reminded to do a few things that I might not have remembered, but I am not excited to craft my things to do.</p>

<p>I think part of the problem is I have a bunch of stuff coming in from Workflowy, which includes little reminders (wear a belt, which I sometimes forget) and (do not eat after 9pm, which I sometimes ignore)</p>

<p>I am just blathering, but if this is a thing that people go through (and has an article written, I would not mind being pointed to it, or) you can just nod and listen</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://complice.co/about-the-team">Malcom</a> from <a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a> wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a thing that probably warrants an article being written about
it! It took me awhile to get to this, but I have now written TWO
articles! One is published, and the other one (which is a more direct
reply to you) is not yet. But here it is:</p>

<p>This is a natural cycle. What you&rsquo;re encountering is a form of
staleness. Complice is in general designed to combat staleness, for
instance by not allowing you to enter a bunch of tasks that you&rsquo;re not
actually going to do today. However, staleness can still show up in a
few ways. The dailies and notdones features were ones that I knew
would introduce sources of staleness into the system, so I did my best
to counter-optimize for that. I think I did a reasonably good job, but
it&rsquo;s not perfect yet.</p>

<p>The WorkFlowy integration&hellip; needs major work. Having established that, there are two levels to it:</p>

<ol>
<li>What can you do differently? (since you&rsquo;re asking)</li>
<li>What can Complice do differently? (since most Complice users won&rsquo;t read this article)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What can you do differently?</strong></p>

<p>It sounds to me like you want to fix your belt problem using
something other than a reminder in your task list. I wrote an article
called
<a href="https://blog.complice.co/post/111442313267/how-to-send-perfectly-timed-physical-messages-to">How to send perfectly-timed physical messages to your future self</a>
which would advocate for a strategy something like &ldquo;when you take your
belt off, put it on top of something that you&rsquo;ll pick up tomorrow
after you have your pants on&rdquo; and then obviously when you go to pick
up that something, you&rsquo;ll first need to pick up your belt, at which
point you put your belt on.</p>

<p>This is a specific example, but the general principle is that doing
your desired behavior automatically is better than doing it by
reminder. And if you do have to use a reminder, the best kind is one
that leaves no ambiguity about whether or not now is the moment. So
for &ldquo;do not eat after 9pm&rdquo;, maybe what you want is something that will
make your phone buzz once at 8:30pm, to remind you that it&rsquo;s your last
chance to eat today, and something to make your phone buzz at 9pm,
indicating that eating is now over for the day.</p>

<p>Another even-more-general principle is: <strong>if something isn&rsquo;t working,
stop doing it</strong>. If the Complice &ldquo;do not eat after 9pm&rdquo; intention
isn&rsquo;t reminding you to stop eating after 9pm, then find something
else. You might still keep the intention around if you want to <em>track</em>
which days you were successful at this, but it&rsquo;s clearly failing as a
reminder.</p>

<p><strong>Triaging staleness</strong></p>

<p>While writing this post, I ended up writing so much under dealing
with staleness that I decided to make it its own post:
<a href="https://blog.complice.co/post/173836925777/making-sense-of-a-single-stale-task">Making sense of a single stale task</a>
The basic gist is that it could be because the thing actually doesn&rsquo;t
matter, or it could be because you&rsquo;re conflicted about it. If the
thing doesn&rsquo;t matter, don&rsquo;t do it! If you&rsquo;re conflicted, either fix
the task until you&rsquo;re not conflicted, or find a way to get back in
touch with why the task matters so that rather than forcing yourself
to do it (and resisting being forced) you&rsquo;re naturally drawn to it
based on your sense of purpose.</p>

<p><strong>What can Complice do differently?</strong></p>

<p>Well, one thing would be if Complice could detect when people might be
in situations like yours, and encourage them to reflect a bit like
this post is doing.</p>

<p>Another piece is that it&rsquo;s currently hard to stop stale WorkFlowy
things that are getting pulled into Complice, from within the Complice
UI. My workflow for this looks like &ldquo;copy the node id from my
intentions textbox, open up a WorkFlowy tab, replace the node id in
that tab with the one from my intentions, then delete/complete/untag
that node.&rdquo; Even though that only takes 10-20 seconds, it&rsquo;s still way
too cumbersome.</p>

<p>Regarding reflecting when things go stale, Complice could notice when
you have an intention N days in a row and it doesn&rsquo;t get done, and
prompt you to think about it a bit more. The notdone propagator
currently does this with one-off intentions, but there&rsquo;s still a major
issue here with repeating tasks either from the built-in dailies or
from WorkFlowy.</p>

<p>St Patrick&rsquo;s Day today and I wrote a letter to Ma, and all of these so
far</p>

<pre><code>2) eat well
2) brush teeth in morning
2) do ten pushups
2) do 40 second plank
2) do 45 kettlebell lifts
&amp;) write quick letter to Ma
6) write Ma's address on envelope
&amp;) target complete above by 10am
3) one pomo try to run on hardware
2) do ten more pushups
2) do 40 second plank again
3) one pomo try to run on hardware
&amp;) target complete above by 11:30am
0) do two pomos of hypnotherapy
&amp;) target complete above by 12:30pm
</code></pre>

<p>Plus started the laundry and spent some time with babychan, who is
also getting her stuff done.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a tiny bit too cold to go outside and walk in sunshine, but I
might do it anyway.</p>

<p>Things I am working on now include this journal entry:</p>

<pre><code>7) write something
</code></pre>

<p>and others:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;) target complete above by 1:00pm
1) one hour building MT3 (https://mt3.robnugen.com)
&amp;) target complete above by 3:00pm
8) P210の単語のページを使って、
8) 漢字の練習と文章を作っておいてください。
&amp;) leave for Japanese circle by 4:30pm
6) go to Japanese men's circle
6) mail check to Ma
2) eat on the way home or meet Babychan somewhere
5) prepare IL Japan article
2) do not eat after 9pm
2) fill in contract regarding food
</code></pre>

<p>I just now got https working again on mt3.robnugen.com.  For some
reason it was set on something other than Let&rsquo;s Encrypt on my
Dreamhost account, but not sure how I might have done that.  Weird.
Anyway, it should work indefinitely until I stop paying or whatever.</p>

<p>Chillin at airport now in Portland, about to go home.  Sad that I did
not connect with Colleen or anyone else who may be here.</p>

<p>Ecstatic about deep transformational work and experience I had.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I am writing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my things to do:</p>

<p>1) copy things to do here
2) add new Complice Goal of Connect with Babychan
3) copy my things to do back onto Complice</p>

<p>Okay so here is step one:</p>

<pre><code>5) get caught up on email
&amp;) process most email
2) brush teeth in morning $wf:r:cdd283568d11
7) write something about my experience $wf:r:6f3d9a1f2ae4
7) write something else
1) day off $wf:r:716d40cb45f8
2) do ten pushups $wf:r:219a438d8f19
2) eat well $wf:r:dec36bfd8499
2) fill in contract regarding food $wf:r:0e1b8532c6b9
8) read something $wf:r:7c12c63d02c2
6) fly back to Japan
6) sleep on plane to get back on Japan sleep schedule
6) go to men's circle
9) go see my babychan
</code></pre>

<p>Okay step two is done.</p>

<p>And neither step one nor step three was required because Complice
saved my work automatically.</p>

<p>I am on track to finish my todo list today on
<a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a>.  I got my AB work
complete, though there is the possibility they will want one more
change on it.  I am prepared for work tomorrow and now just gotta
write this journal entry, studying Japanese, work tonight, Japanese
lesson tonight with Mel, ..</p>

<p>I watched episode 6(?) of Kakegurui.  They did not have the subtitles
added yet, but I could understand the overall meaning because the
acting is so over-the-top, plus explained visually (given that it&rsquo;s a
tv show)</p>

<p>I signed up for beeminder but am not sure if/how/when I will use it.</p>

<p>JUST as I got ready to do one thing after waiting for an answer to do
a different thing, the answer came back to do the different thing
instead of one thing.   bah multi-tasking is dumb.</p>

<p>Go teach GG in Akiba</p>

<p>Go lunch with E in Ueno</p>

<p>Go to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned  (a first for me!)  I&rsquo;m
curious if the difference will be noticeable.</p>

<h2 id="13-00-tuesday-17-january-2017-jst">13:00 Tuesday 17 January 2017 JST</h2>

<p>At the GG lesson I learned a couple interesting things about Japanese
school system.</p>

<p>According to my students, there is a strict rule about how birthdates
correspond to what year of school a student is in.</p>

<p>For kindergarten, all students who were born between March 31st of
one year and March 30th of the next year will start kindergarten this
year.</p>

<p>For elementary school, all students who were born between April 2nd of
one year and April 1st of the next year will start school this year.</p>

<p>Wait what?  So students born on March 31st or April 1st have to wait
in limbo for a year????</p>

<p>Lunch with E featured pizza in Ueno!  She told lots of interesting
stories about the history of the world.</p>

<p>Got my teeth cleaned at dentist.  I can&rsquo;t really tell a difference in
color, but my tongue said they felt different.</p>

<h2 id="16-40-tuesday-17-january-2017-jst">16:40 Tuesday 17 January 2017 JST</h2>

<p>I walked from Yurakucho to Hiroo in 1 hour.</p>

<p>I-group was great.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to Head Heart and Soul on 31
January 2017.</p>
