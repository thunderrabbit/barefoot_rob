      <description>10:32 Sunday 31 May 2015 JST workshop today
16:47 The workshop was quite great, though specifically geared toward teaching children. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to apply some of the stuff I learned to my classes.
Mostly I learned &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not the answer that matters so much; it&amp;rsquo;s the thinking.&amp;rdquo;
This quote might summarize the content of the workshop and the presentation of the workshop itself.
And I tried to play it cool, but I got big crush on K, next to whom I sat during the second half.</description>

      <description>06:34 Sunday 17 May 2015 JST I woke up early to upgrade the server:
sudo do-release-upgrade
&amp;ldquo;Installing the upgrade can take several hours&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;
I read that and noped out! I better let the client know first!
sudo apt-get upgrade for now.</description>
