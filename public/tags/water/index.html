<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>This morning, Jason and I played lots in the lake again, chicken fights and acrobatics of whatever sort we could come up with including Jessica on Jason's shoulders while Jason on my shoulders. We tried some 6-person pyramids, but couldn't get them to work.

<p>We played keep away from Maia with Maia's hat and sunglasses. Actually I did play a bit, but tried to keep the group to remain respectful of her stuff.

<p>Then I took a phat nap before lunch.

<p>Water activity workshop after dark designed by Jen Colbert, included water balloon tossing and a big slip-n-slide.  Frank and I used raquet looking things each with a net to catch the balloons. I think we did quite well considering how dark it was.

<p>Ate plenty of ice cream after dinner.

<p>Then worship led by Tiffany Schneider was basically "break up into groups and talk about your beliefs." I expressed pretty verbosely what I believed and how my beliefs had changed throughout the years.  Afterward, I felt honored when Sean Murray said, "I had always wondered what Rob believed."  Wow.

<p>Back to main cabin for more ice cream and I loved sitting with an informal group listening to <a href="https://www.geocities.com/sunsetstrip/studio/4367">Kris Scott</a> live in concert, guitar and singing his various favorites and taking requests. He is really good and I look forward to seeing his performance career develop beautifully, not to mention purchasing his third tape when it comes out.

<p>Swam after dark and Susan accompanied me both to and from the lake. On the way up there, she held my hand and looked up at the stars the entire way there. On the way back, I held her hand and walked with my eyes closed the entire way back.

<p>Said HI to Chris Anderson, who had a CD pumping loudly from his car.  A german band with a name I can't begin to remember, but which he could pronounce surprisingly well.

<p>Bed now.

<p><p class=note>(transcribed out of my diary)</p>
<p>
Wende and I are in New Braunfels at her parents&rsquo; house.  We went to Schlitterbahn today&ndash;my first time there&ndash;and had a ton of fun.  There are 3 separate parks.
<p>
I was most technologically impressed with the water coaster.  The water pressure accelerated the tube boats up up up so they could slide down then up then down and the key was (of all things) large holes in the bottom of the up ramps which let out the water that was no longer going up so that it wouldn&rsquo;t slow the boat.<br>
Torrents of water fell splashing all over the ground, usually where people could walk &amp; get drenched.
<p>
Second most technologically impresive was the Boogie Bahn, a surfing wave thing with water shootin&rsquo; down into a large trough and then back up and out/over the other side.  I did it twice, much much much better the second time when I stayed surfin&rsquo; (on my tummy on the board) for about a full minute. Very cool.  But we did not bring a camera.
<p>
I really enjoyed circling around a perpetual water circle cycle / wave pool thing.  Went around it about 6 times.  I treaded water for 105 wave cycles in a small wave pool.  I enjoyed the exertion.
<p>
My favorite ride at the first section of Schlitterbahn wound its way through the trees and down down all around and then bububububububububububububub fast down to the end.
<p>
I zipped down a body slide chute and down one that required a board or something like that.  The only thing I did not find was a slide or thing or anything that had blinding white knuckle incredible speed.  Closest was the surf thing and exertion at the wave pool. No speed but exertion.
