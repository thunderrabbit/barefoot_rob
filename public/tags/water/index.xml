      <description>SWUUSI
2:30am Tuesday 28 July 1998
transcribed from my diary This morning, Jason and I played lots in the lake again, chicken fights and acrobatics of whatever sort we could come up with including Jessica on Jason&#39;s shoulders while Jason on my shoulders. We tried some 6-person pyramids, but couldn&#39;t get them to work. We played keep away from Maia with Maia&#39;s hat and sunglasses. Actually I did play a bit, but tried to keep the group to remain respectful of her stuff.</description>

      <description>Saturday 28 June 1997
(transcribed out of my diary)
 Wende and I are in New Braunfels at her parents&amp;rsquo; house. We went to Schlitterbahn today&amp;ndash;my first time there&amp;ndash;and had a ton of fun. There are 3 separate parks.  I was most technologically impressed with the water coaster. The water pressure accelerated the tube boats up up up so they could slide down then up then down and the key was (of all things) large holes in the bottom of the up ramps which let out the water that was no longer going up so that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t slow the boat.</description>
