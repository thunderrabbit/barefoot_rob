      <description>08:40 Friday 15 December 2017 JST Wow we arrive in just 4 hours. I tried to stay up longer by watching a movie, but maybe I should have gotten out my computer. I had had a headache from being up so late so I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I could program well.
I slept most of the flight already, it seems. 11 hour flight, 7 hours down.
It is basically 8pm in our final destination, so I want to sleep again soon.</description>

      <description>08:01 Thursday 01 January 2015 AWST 09:03 Thursday 01 January 2015 JST Hmm. That date isn&amp;rsquo;t correct. My computer battery died while I was writing an email (thank goodness for free wifi and that Gmail saved it in realtime) and I guess the clock battery died as well???
09:08 Monday 17 October 2016 JST Okay this is more likely to be correct.
I slept for a good bit of the 7 hour flight from Perth to Honkers</description>
