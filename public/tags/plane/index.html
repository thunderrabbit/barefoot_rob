<h2 id="08-35-saturday-28-july-2018-jst">08:35 Saturday 28 July 2018 JST</h2>

<p class="dream">
There's an approach to Dallas airport over a mountain, where we fly through a mountain pass, over a ridge, right around an outcropping of rock, and then into a cave which serves as the runway.
</p>

<p class="dream">
This was my forth time to arrive on this runway, and the big screen window in front gives everyone a great view of the approach in real-time.  As usual, everyone shares the same awestruck feelings, ranging from "we are all going to die" to "wow that's amazing", but that's only from what we can see through the window.
</p>

<p class="dream">
This time, I noticed something orders of magnitude more amazing than any other time I have arrived at this airport.  As the plane flew into the cave, we didn't touch down immediately like most times.  This time the pilot slowed us down so once we actually landed, we rolled only 21 meters after wheels contacted the ground.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I pointed out to some of the other passengers who were all duly impressed with the visible parts of the landing, because I was sitting where I could see the tachometer, and how it didn't start counting until we were nearly stopped.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I stepped down off the platform and walked to where the pilots were gathering their bags and talking together.
</p>

<p class="dream">
I shouted "Captain Solo!" to get their attention with a comparison to Han Solo (and his flight skills) because I heard many passengers make the same comparison while witnessing the landing.
</p>

<p class="dream">
They looked up, and I was like "Captain, I have arrived at this airport several times, and it's always amazing, but this time I noticed how we only rolled twenty one meters after touchdown.  I'm so impressed I just had to say thank you."
</p>

<p class="dream">
The older Captain nodded with humble thanks and the younger said "be sure to prepare a present," so I immediately handed over my phone which was open on the back screen to a video clip of us standing dangerously close to the edge of the very same outcropping of rock around which we have to fly during this approach.
</p>

<p class="dream">
They smiled and said like wow nice picture how did you get that? And though it was actually a selfie, I realized it might be in an illegal location, so I was like "oh I just found it online.." and he handed the phone back, saying thanks for showing me; I hadn't seen it before.
</p>

<p>And I woke up.</p>

<p>Wow we arrive in just 4 hours.  I tried to stay up longer by watching
a movie, but maybe I should have gotten out my computer.  I had had a
headache from being up so late so I didn&rsquo;t think I could program well.</p>

<p>I slept most of the flight already, it seems.  11 hour flight, 7 hours
down.</p>

<p>It is basically 8pm in our final destination, so I want to sleep again
soon.</p>

<p>My theory is that I switch my timezone to the destination time as soon
as I get on the plane.  We will be in Dubai just 2 hours so I skipped
that destination in my plan.</p>

<h2 id="20-48-thursday-14-december-2017-03">20:48 Thursday 14 December 2017 -03</h2>

<p>Okay I just switched the clock on my computer.  The &ldquo;-03&rdquo; looks weird
to me, but that&rsquo;s how emacs presented the timezone.</p>

<p>I shan&rsquo;t dig into it now; I want to work on Godot before bedtime.</p>

<h2 id="21-25-thursday-14-december-2017-03">21:25 Thursday 14 December 2017 -03</h2>

<p>Woah we have free wifi on this flight, it seems!</p>

<p>They give a free 20MB taster for 2 hours.  I shan&rsquo;t be watching cat
videos, but it&rsquo;s enough to check email.</p>

<p>It is <em>not</em> enough to push my journal repo more than a few times, so I
will refrain.</p>

<p>Hmm.  That date isn&rsquo;t correct.  My computer battery died while I was
writing an email (thank goodness for free wifi and that Gmail saved it
in realtime) and I guess the clock battery died as well???</p>

<h2 id="09-08-monday-17-october-2016-jst">09:08 Monday 17 October 2016 JST</h2>

<p>Okay this is more likely to be correct.</p>

<p>I slept for a good bit of the 7 hour flight from Perth to Honkers</p>

<h2 id="16-11-monday-17-october-2016-jst">16:11 Monday 17 October 2016 JST</h2>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t see the TV guys when I got out of the airport, but I must say
it&rsquo;s nice to not have to wait in a line 200 people long in order to go
through immigration.  Will it be even faster (not have to fill out an
arrival card) when I have my permanent visa?</p>
