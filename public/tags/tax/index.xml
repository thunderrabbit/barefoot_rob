      <description>10:29 Monday 15 April 2019 JST I filed my US taxes with Taxes for Expats, on time even if I lived in the US! I get an automatic 2 month extension by living overseas. It is comforting to outsource the annoying parts of taxes and they have my back in case of an audit.

      <description>10:59 Friday 16 February 2018 JST I cannot decide if I should care that my accountants apparently cannot spell or cannot hire proofreaders or what. Does it make a difference? Should I complain? Stop using them? Is this just a case of English language changing?
I mean language is a tool to transmit meaning between people and written language is a tool to transmit meaning across time as well. I know what they mean, but could there be a case where it&amp;rsquo;s not clear?</description>
