      <description>08:54 Monday 06 May 2019 JST It turns out I like the bag Lin bought online better than the bag I bought in a shop last year. The wheels on her bag are larger and quieter. That was something I could not test on the linoleum tile floors in the shop. That sounded perfectly smooth there, but out on the street they are raucous.
And this bag has more pockets.</description>

      <description>21:57 Tuesday 27 October 2015 JST I showed Mutsumi how my bag is losing its stuffing which regularly gets stuck in the ports on my laptop. She suggested making a slip for the computer. Wow! I had only thought about buying covers for it, but rejected the idea because they&amp;rsquo;re usually a bit bulky, and almost certainly overpriced. Bah.
Hmmm! Making a cover could be just the thing&amp;hellip; and she said she might make it!</description>
