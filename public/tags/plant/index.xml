      <description>18:08 Wednesday 31 July 2019 JST Today the weather was quite lovely, so I spent some time outside repotting some baby plants that had come from Alex, who froze two winters ago.
The original Alex can be seen in the first two pics here.
     
20:12 Wednesday 31 July 2019 JST I just got super sidetracked looking for Alex pictures, after finding a journal entry with a missing image of Alex.</description>

Alex, our panda ear plant, has been hanging out above our balcony for the past few weeks. I hung him there so he could get more sun. Normally we move him indoors when it rains, but since he&amp;rsquo;s been above our heads, I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen him to remember (and I guess Lin hasn&amp;rsquo;t either). I checked on him now, and he seems just fine.</description>
