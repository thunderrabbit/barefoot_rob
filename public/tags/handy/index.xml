      <description>15:53 Friday 28 July 2017 JST On my way to Gunma today, I stopped by Joanna&amp;rsquo;s to install a ceiling fan which she had ordered. She took me to a restaurant which served everything on (round) tortillas with the sides folded to make them square.
Great to see her again and hear about how things have been going! Been a long time since The Artist&amp;rsquo;s Way back in the day.</description>

I know the nimble cats can jump over it, but hopefully the mean heavy cats will not. There&amp;rsquo;s a small brown cat who likes to chill on our balcony. We&amp;rsquo;re not ready for three (3) cats, so haven&amp;rsquo;t let him inside. But we have been feeding him because&amp;hellip; cat!
However, there&amp;rsquo;s a big bully cat who wants the same balcony space so I blocked the small gap where they usually enter the balcony.</description>
