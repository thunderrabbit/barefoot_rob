      <description>18:41 Wednesday 02 May 2018 JST Lin and I went to Giwado in Kanda, a foot massage shop I like, and got 45 minute foot massages! Ate lunch with Charu after that and then headed back home because we were tired and the weather planned to rain.
Ate ice cream at BR31 after I found my third geocache, the geocache in 新百合ヶ丘駅.
Lin joined me to find my fourth, but we could not find it.</description>

      <description>23:57 Tuesday 12 September 2017 JST Just got home via taxi with Lin after eating ice cream with her near our station. I got Ben and Jerry&amp;rsquo;s cotton candy (which was similar to Baskin Robbin&amp;rsquo;s Popping Shower), and she got cherry by some other premium brand, the name of which escapes me now.
Lin and I took the same train from Noborito to our station. She had gotten on near Shinjuku, and we did not specifically plan to take the same train, but it worked out that way.</description>
