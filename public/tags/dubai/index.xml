      <description>17:18 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 (SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil) 23:19 Sunday 31 December 2017 +04 (Dubai - United Arab Emirates) 04:20 Monday 01 January 2018 JST (Tokyo - Japan) We arrived and went to the baggage claim but, fortunately thanks to Lin checking first, we discovered we could not get our checked baggage in Dubai when staying in hotels in the airport.
But what&amp;rsquo;s awesome: the guy was like beep beep beep and said our baggage would be redirected to Haneda just like that boom.</description>

      <description>14:45 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 I am certainly getting tired. I did not sleep the last 4 hours of the flight as planned. I kept working on Godot and then watched the last couple or three episodes of Lucifer season 2.
The flight was scheduled to be 14 hours, so I have been awake about 17 hours since my last entry.
Okay, yes I woke up at 20:47 and it is now 14:49 the next day.</description>
