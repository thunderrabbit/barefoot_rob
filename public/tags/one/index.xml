      <description>23:15 Friday 12 May 2017 JST After we stood hand in hand for a while, she said she felt very connected to the forest through me. I asked if I could bless her with a hug.. after a few moments of hug, I just started to cry. &amp;quot;It&#39;s so good to see you again. I have missed you so much.&amp;quot; Wow. Thank you. And I caught my train on time.</description>
