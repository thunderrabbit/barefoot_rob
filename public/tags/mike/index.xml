18:51 Friday 14 July 2017 JST Such a nice area! We went to a long cave thing that was apparently dug without modern equipment. It is 400 meters long, and was apparently supposed to go 400 meters more, but life and heavy rock got in the way. Really nice quiet energy there.
Visited a 41.8 meter tall statue which is 10 meters taller than Corcovado in Rio.</description>
