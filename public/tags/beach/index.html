<p>We got to the beach around 10am and it was warm; by the time we left
around 2pm it was hotter than I could stand to walk barefoot on the
sand.</p>

<p>We ate at a vegetarian buffet <a href="https://yoganiigata.jp/">https://yoganiigata.jp/</a> Good for
1600 yen per person.</p>

<p>Dug a hole for myself on the beach but it was too far from the waves
to bury me in the sand.  Headed down to the water a bit more and
meditated with Lin.  Kept moving down toward the water so I was in the
waves from 0 to 40cm deep, avg 2~10cm.  たのしかった</p>

<p>Got Godot app to highlight clicked items today and got it to highlight
subsequent mouseovered items and unswipe backtracked items.</p>

<p>Right now 8:00 at Lin&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s restaurant calling her sisters and he
wants them to sell products in Japan and oldest sister is like False.</p>

<p>But the best news is for MT3.  Her dad gave me hundreds of ice cream
spoons of a shape I had never seen before.</p>

<p>Lin and I just walked along the beach from the restaurante de
churrascos (sp) after pretty much gorging on all the offerings.</p>

<p>I saw some really neat rivulets on the beach (but forgot to take a
picture) where water seems to just spring from the beach.  I guess
that is exactly what&rsquo;s happening; water within the sand works its way
out and then comes down to the ocean.</p>

<p>Great view of semi-fragile sand dunes, but not safe to climb ざんねん.
Hot girls including one with braces.  OMG why do so many adults have
braces here?</p>

<p>Finished algorithm for the app (LeSwipe / ConSwi) to deal with linking
swipes to shapes while chilling in a self made hole in the beach.</p>

<p>(pictures coming soon?)</p>

<p>Quite interesting to see the waves coming in over the very-flat beach,
so it came up significantly farther and farther with each passing unit
of time.  There was a bridge from the steps to the shore but even it
did not stay dry at high tide.</p>

<p>Before taking video of kids leaping from the restaurant balcony into
high tide, I took several pics of the water coming in, which I hope to
make into an animation.</p>

<h2 id="22-18pm">22:18pm</h2>

<p>wow so much to see in Brazil!</p>

<p>Played table football with Artulio(sp) as sister whined or watched
videos.  He never cared that I never understood, and he never tried to
understand when I spoke verbally.</p>

<p>At the end I threw a peace sign and he gently corrected me with throat
slit pantomime.  I guess it is serious bzns.</p>

<p>Relaxing on the beach, we got some delicious drinks: <em>manga con leche</em>
(sp) for me and acerola for Lin.  Mine was sweeet and <em>muito
deliciouso</em> (sp).</p>

<p>A man came by with a young boy in his arms, and we ended up giving him
R10 $3. Then other guys selling shirts, cashews, art, and maybe one
more before we ended up just leaving instead of saying no no no no.</p>

<p>Egad I am missing SOGO again (4 times in a row)</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s nice to see Lisa and Miho!</p>

<p>Actually only Lisa is with us while Lin is driving, and they are all
blah blah blabbin chat chat chattin and missed a turn recommended by
GPS.  Twice.</p>

<h2 id="11-33-sunday-16-july-2017-jst">11:33 Sunday 16 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay we just got Miho yay!</p>

<h2 id="13-07-sunday-16-july-2017-jst">13:07 Sunday 16 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Only 1 hour (4.9km) to go! <del>Yay!</del></p>

<p>I could have fucking gone to SOGO and take the train down to meet Lin
and them. fack.</p>

<h2 id="14-00-sunday-16-july-2017-jst">14:00 Sunday 16 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>We arrived.  So hard for me to understand how driving is preferable to
Lin.</p>

<h2 id="18-31-sunday-16-july-2017-jst">18:31 Sunday 16 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay okay the day turned out to be pretty good.  We had a nice time by
the ocean (not beach; it was all layers of volcanic rocks tilted at an
angle)</p>

<p>After we set up our tent and chairs, Lin found the same little pool
that we enjoyed 2(?) years ago.  I guided Miho there with the fewest
vertical changes, and then carried all our stuff to the spot.</p>

<p>Got into the water slowly; it was cold and wavy over sharp shells.
There is a still pool nearby where the water is a bit warm in the top
meter or so.  The warm pool had some anemones in it which I think may
have stung Lin, Miho, and Lisa.  I got poked by one so went out a
different direction.</p>

<p>We pet the cat at the ice cream shop with a cat and Lin did a cat
impression while I took slo mo video.  Not sure it is worth putting
online, but she seemed surprisingly not embarrassed by it, so she
might.</p>

<p>I climbed with Francois up a slightly steep hill next to the car and
then threw him down to get funny pictures.  Lin tried to throw him
back and he ended up in a place that required judicious use of the
parasol pole Lin bought for this trip.  Glad it came in helpful!</p>

<p>I joined Lin who met her co-workers in Kamakura for a going away party
for one of the managers.  Aki had a Canon <em>film</em> camera with a short
little lens, so I offered to give her the slightly longer lens that
came with my Canon EOS.</p>
