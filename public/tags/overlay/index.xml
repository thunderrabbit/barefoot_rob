      <description>15:00 Saturday 18 November 2017 JST During the livestream today, I watched the (5) clips so far to see which characters have had the ability to pass through tracks. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s easier to let characters pass through tracks, but I think it would be a good subtle thing if some characters (consistently) can, and some (consistently) cannot.
Anyway, I took notes and pinned them to the blue fabric which makes the floor of the set.</description>
