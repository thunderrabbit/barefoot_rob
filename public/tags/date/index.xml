      <description>15:46 Saturday 26 November 2016 JST Lin and I are at a buffet restaurant near Shin Yurigaoka. First time to eat here but probably not the last! I don&amp;rsquo;t yet know the name of the restaurant, but a lot of the food is vegetarian.
It&amp;rsquo;s called Harvest.</description>

      <description>##21:53 Tuesday 27 November 2012
Lin and I went on an impromptu date tonight, first visiting the ramen place adjacent to Kawasaki station, but turning away from its 20 minute line.
We were going to go to the cheap and delicious Chinese place with the cute-nosed waitress, but then I suggested we try Taro&amp;rsquo;s restaurant. Taro stands out on the corner soliciting customers, and has a super genki personality that piqued my curiosity enough to try the place.</description>
