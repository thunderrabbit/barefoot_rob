      <description>12:42 Wednesday 01 April 2015 JST Thanks to MDX for sending his veggies with rootballs included so I could just pop them back in the dirt!

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure which is which, but I think the one in the plastic pot is cabbage, while the others are a bit fluffier.
Hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll all grow and be happy!
Hopefully we can expand our garden from here! This is actually on our neighbor&amp;rsquo;s property, but he gave Lin his blessing.</description>
