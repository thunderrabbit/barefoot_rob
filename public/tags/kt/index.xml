      <description>16:32 Saturday 30 January 2016 CST Great surprise to get an email from kT who was like, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m on my way!!&amp;rdquo; and I finally got her message when she was 15 minutes from Ma&amp;rsquo;s apartment! Whoohooo!!!
I skated down to the front office to meet her and big hugs before walking back to the crib.
HI Lin! Surprise this is kT! and hugs and chat chat as we waited for Ma and Jon before heading out to me and Lin&amp;rsquo;s wedding ceremony!</description>
