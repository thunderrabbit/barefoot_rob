<p class="dream">I was a little bit confused on the train as it went through a tunnel, I realized the train was different than other trains.  It was longer, like one continuous car as it snaked along the route.  The seat next to me was available, so I patted on it to invite the guy sitting on the other side of the empty seat to sit closer.  He ignored me, but I had made the offer, so that was good enough.</p>

<p class="dream">In the train station, I realized it was a little different because we had arrived at 3F instead of 2F.  I was hungry so went to a shop.  I wanted to get something a bit healthy so I settled on a tuna sandwich with wheat bread.  One of the cashiers was checking out a customer, so I took the sandwich to the other cashier, and then realized she wasn't a cashier because she wasn't wearing a uniform.  She assured me my initial guess was correct: she *was* a cashier and was happy to help.</p>

<p class="dream">I didn't have any money, so I used an 1/8th of the tuna sandwich.  I gave it to her and she placed it on a scale.  It was worth twice what the sandwich had cost, so I was like "d'oh! I over estimated." I wondered if she would give me half of the 1/8th back, or give me currency back.</p>

<p>In waking reality, Lin woke up to let Jennie inside which woke me up
and I realized the dream was interesting enough to jot down.</p>
