                        <p>(adapted from my note last night to Mark)</p>

<p>I went to a stand-up comedy open mic tonight and ended up doing a set
(my first ever!)</p>

<p>Several jokes went well, a couple did not; one of those is not
recoverable in any way I can think of.</p>

<p>Soness said it was really good that I used contents of the room for
several of my bits.</p>

                        <p>I am excited about Remembering Past Lives workshop today</p>

<p>(written 17:13 Thursday 12 September 2019 JST:)</p>

<p>Two people in attendance and had a good time!  Great to hear their
questions at the beginning.  One was &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the process?&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>Each participant gets into a relaxed position, usually either sitting
in a chair, or laying down, or otherwise sitting against something
comfortable.

I will spend a few minutes leading you through a relaxation process,
whereby you let your body relax and keep your mind awake.  Once you
are in this mind awake / body asleep mode, I'll invite you to imagine
getting up and leaving the room.  In your mind I will guide you to
travel far away, whether by vehicle, or through a cave, or through a
forest and arrive somewhere familiar.

I will give you a chance to explore the familiar area, including
seeing other inhabitants of the area and moving around and
communicating with them.

I will lead you gently back the way you came, allowing you to have
clear memory of what happened and what you heard and saw.  Once your
awareness focuses back on your physical body, you will have a chance
to write down what you heard and saw.  We will not speak until
everyone is pretty much done writing.

The whole process is a state of light hypnosis, and you will still
have full control and awareness of where your physical body is.  You
will be able to come back in a moment's notice if you choose.

Each process will take about 20 or 30 minutes.
</code></pre>

<p>One participant saw the same place in two of the three excursions we
did.  The other saw some of the same imagery twice, but did not report
as clear of a vision of the place itself.</p>

<p>All in all, a great time!</p>

<h5 id="21-22-saturday-13-april-2019-jst">21:22 Saturday 13 April 2019 JST</h5>

<p>Just got back home, though we left Yomiuriland around 5pm.  Pretty
early from my point of view, but they were both tired.</p>

<p>Good times.</p>

<p>Exciting MKP Tokyo news!</p>

<p>I sent this to my online Integration Group.</p>

<pre><code>I just got confirmation: I will be co-facilitating a 3-week online
MKP introduction called The Men's Work https://mkpusa.org/themenswork/
with Paul Newell, who is currently co-facilitating it in the US.

On Fridays, 7pm - 8:30pm (Japan time), November 3rd, 10th, and
17th, we will do this online training for men in Tokyo.

Once we run this 3 week series of meetings a couple of times, I
will create a new men's circle in Gotanda (Tokyo) on Fridays for
men who are interested.  Once those Gotanda men have sat in circle
for a few months, I will do a Mission Statement workshop with
them.

Once we have two circles humming along, I plan to invite an MKP
man from overseas to Japan to teach facilitation skills to men who
are interested.  My want is to get more and more circles started
in Japan so we can create a groundswell movement to have enough
energy to do NWTAs here in Japan.

<p>I&rsquo;m excited when I think about my vision, and I&rsquo;m scared what I think
about implementing it.</p>

<p>I have been leading Tokyo men&rsquo;s Circle for three years, And my vision
is to create more circles that are empowered to continue doing their
own emotional growth work.</p>

<p>Oh my gosh wow!!!  I like watching construction so I often take
pictures of construction sites.  Today I was having a gander at new
building construction near 金沢八景駅 and I noticed a big digger thing
suspended over a large vertical tube.  Then I noticed the tube was
slowly rotating!</p>

<p>I started taking video with Periscope (so it&rsquo;s online now, even before
this message is written) and stepped over a fence, which gained the
attention from an <em>English speaking</em> security guard!  He explained
that it was in fact a large post hole digger, but not for a building..
They&rsquo;re going to <em>extend the Seaside Line</em> to 金沢八景駅!!!</p>

<p>Right now, the two stations are a few hundred meters apart, but all
that is going to change&hellip; within a couple years, I guess!!  The
Seaside Line&rsquo;s existing 金沢八景駅 will be demolished and the trains
will go the extra 200 meters to help people be lazy!  Yayyy!!???</p>

<p>Got an email from Travis today indicating that he refactored my Hakyll installation.  Whoohoo!!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/TravisCardwell/hakyll-journal/commits/73c097622380ed70f30bcf51306c25c41d25fd92">refactorization he&rsquo;s done so far is visible here</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest changes (in terms of me not understanding them well) are in one file.  <a href="https://github.com/TravisCardwell/hakyll-journal/commit/05416e71fbbf0f910bcc19717ee88d7ae810c9bd">https://github.com/TravisCardwell/hakyll-journal/commit/05416e71fbbf0f910bcc19717ee88d7ae810c9bd</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to put all his changes into the &lsquo;master&rsquo; branch, merge them into my recently created &lsquo;rob&rsquo; branch, then replace my personalized content in master with some generic stuff so it&rsquo;s easier for people to use this repo for their own Hakyll installations.</p>

<p>I apparently have some invitations to hand out, so email me if you want one.</p>

<p>In the first 3 minutes of using it (from my desktop), I archived ~200 messages quite easily.</p>

<p>Thanks you Inbox team!</p>
