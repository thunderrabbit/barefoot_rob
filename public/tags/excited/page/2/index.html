<p>In about 24 hours we will be on a 747 in Los
Angeles going, "oh my god!  We're on a seven forty
seven!!!"</p>

<p>I have just been using my new Handspring Visor
after exchanging my old one for a new one because my
old one was draining batteries at a ridiculously fast
clip.  My thankful intention is that I'll be able to
write tons and tons of great stuff and move it to my
website once I get home.</p>

<p>I will have internet access while in Melbourne, so
I will probably write some directly to my site while
I'm there.  A great bulk of entries will be on my
Visor though.</p>

<p>I'm kinda rambling; definitely in a weird state of
bewildered excitement.  I am SO Greatly looking
forward to taking such a significant trip with
Wende.</p>

<p>We're going to stay up somewhat late tonight to
help us get on Melbourne schedule.</p>

<p><p>Cute Wende is sleeping on the couch here at work.  She now has Thursdays
off from work.  She brought lunch for us from (guess where?) James Coney
Island and then she was lookin&rsquo; pretty sleepy and I encouraged her to sleep.
She was thinking 20 minutes, but it&rsquo;s been longer than that now and I don&rsquo;t
think she has stirred.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ve been chatting over AIM with a few youth and all are excited about
Tulsa Rally this weekend!!  I&rsquo;ll take copious notes. The drive to Tulsa is
pretty long too.  Longer than to Port Aransas&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Work has been cool today, but we&rsquo;ve had some weird email problems.  We&rsquo;re
sending emails to some people and some of them are getting the attachments
correctly and some are not.  They are all on the same system apparently, but
something has got to be different about the setup..</p>

<p><p class=date>5:15pm</p>

<p><p>Oh my gosh!  Laura just appeared with an enthusiastic &ldquo;boo!&rdquo; at my office
door!  How fun!!  She and Wende are talk talk talking.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure about what we may do tonight; my car is at the shop and I
need to go to see Kathy Fey.</p>

<p><p>Oh!!!  I can drive Wende&rsquo;s truck and Wende and Laura can go play until
I&rsquo;m done.  That will work.</p>

<p><p>See ya!</p>

<p><p>Wow!!!</p>

<p><p>This is pretty frikkin&rsquo; fly!  I just received my stowaway keyboard for my Handspring Visor!  I can now write journal entries so crazy super fast anywhere I go!  It fold into fourths and fits into my pocket!</p>

<p><p>It&rsquo;s a bit weird to have the keyboard slightly flexing when I hit keys on the near the ends of the keyboard, like backspace and shift, but I totally love it!</p>

<p><p>For example, whereas it would normally have taken me like 15 minutes to type all this text, it&rsquo;s only taken me about 2 or 3.</p>

<p><p>Sweet!!</p>

<p><p>We have a dial tone at home!!!  I have just moved all my journal entries online from my computer.  Look for names that start with PP up above.</p>

<p><p>From our house, I called Wende on her cell phone.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Hey Wende, do you hear that noise?&rdquo;  I was walking on the squeaky
part of our floor between our bedroom and bathroom.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Is it you farting?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>I could tell she wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to guess.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the squeak by
our bathroom!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; she sounded disappointed.  Then, &ldquo;How are you calling from
our house??&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Thanks to Mike and Edna; whatever they did worked!!</p>

<p>I am out of school.  I am a senior!  I passed Spanish final with a
72.  I got an 86 in History for the last 6 weeks.  That's great!  I
thought I failed.  Maybe we will grab that room in church today.  Good
Night.</p>
