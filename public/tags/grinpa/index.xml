      <description>(actually written 14:12 Wednesday 24 July 2019 JST)
After getting a photo with Kanauknot, we headed toward the roller coaster, but were sidetracked by a tiny house that offered free entry.
(It was inside the house that I took off my shoes; they felt so uncomfortably hot!)
Lin and Mikarin were like かわいいいいい at everything as I looked to see where I could explore. I considered using the upright piano to access the loft, but decided not to.</description>

      <description>05:32 Sunday 21 July 2019 JST One camping spot remained when we arrived yesterday. It&amp;rsquo;s the high season and reservations are recommended. We set up the tent which thankfully came with ropes to keep it from rotate-collapsing.
This tent is &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; to set up because it has a &amp;ldquo;one touch&amp;rdquo; function that kinda springs the four foldable(!) legs into a spidery stance. Without its rain tarp tied to the legs and the rain tarp tied to the environment, it&amp;rsquo;s flimsy af, but with the 6 provided ropes in place, it&amp;rsquo;s reasonably fine.</description>
