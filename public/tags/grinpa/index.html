                        <p class="note">(actually written 14:12 Wednesday 24 July 2019 JST)</p>

<p>After getting a photo with Kanauknot, we headed toward the roller
coaster, but were sidetracked by a tiny house that offered free
entry.</p>

<p>(It was inside the house that I took off my shoes; they felt so
uncomfortably hot!)</p>

<p>Lin and Mikarin were like かわいいいいい at everything as I looked to
see where I could explore.  I considered using the upright piano to
access the loft, but decided not to.</p>

<p>We skipped the coaster because it&rsquo;s actually super slow, powered not
by gravity, but by motorized car tires in the front and rear cars.</p>

<p>Went to ここドコ (or maybe ココドコ) which is a 3D maze with 12 goals
where we can get stamps to find the location of the 13th stamp,
somewhere in the park.  Mikarin and I found 9 stamps of the 12 before
we accidentally ended up outside the maze area and in the exit steps.
The door locked and the structure surrounding the door did not seem
strong enough to let me climb back over to let us back in.  Fair
enough, and we headed out for more adventures.</p>

<p>Lots of mazey climby type things that would be great to play follow
the leader.  Mikarin did a pretty good job of keeping up with me.</p>

<p>Through one maze, there were too many spider webs so even I was like
&ldquo;bah; let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From inside the fenced area, we took a picture of Lin sleeping.  (I
gotta getta license so I can help her drive.)</p>

<p>Then climbed on more stuff than I can enumerate here in a way that
will even partly make sense.  (I gotta charge my camera more
diligently.)</p>

<p>We did the Ferris Wheel after finding the ropes course type thing
called ワイヤーsomething was closed for repairs.  Apparently guests
must wear shoes in there because I saw signs for shoe rental nearby.</p>

<p>We ate lunch and then were kinda headed out of the park before I saw
the unicycle guy near some kinda balance beam type straps.  He said
they were not slackline so we could not bounce on them, but I do not
know what else to call them.</p>

<p>I balanced my way around the four short segments and then he was like
&ldquo;but can you do it backwards?&rdquo; so I walked a bit backwards.  I tried a
couple different things and I appreciated that he did not try to stop
me (though he did point out some dangers (e.g. the angled strap would
be slippery)).</p>

<p>We balanced on a large plastic ball and jumped around on it.</p>

<p>Basically I was in heaven, climbing and balancing on things.</p>

<p>At some point, he told me they had a show scheduled for 1pm.  Sounds
good, so I went to it.</p>

<p>OMG so glad I did!!</p>

<p>One camping spot remained when we arrived yesterday.  It&rsquo;s the high
season and reservations are recommended.  We set up the tent which
thankfully came with ropes to keep it from rotate-collapsing.</p>

<p>This tent is &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to set up because it has a &ldquo;one touch&rdquo; function
that kinda springs the four foldable(!) legs into a spidery stance.
Without its rain tarp tied to the legs and the rain tarp tied to the
environment, it&rsquo;s flimsy af, but with the 6 provided ropes in place,
it&rsquo;s reasonably fine.</p>

<p>I am a bit envious of Taro&rsquo;s larger tent next door, with its three
arcing support tubes, but our setup is pretty sweet, too.</p>

<p>After setting up the tent, we had an lovely dinner including easy-cook
rice in bags that kinda cooks itself in 15 minutes after we pour water
into the rice in the bag.</p>

<p>I had a seated shower at the communal bath house with four shower
seats and one bath.  I apparently arrived at rush hour; there were no
fewer than 4 adults and an average of two boys each in the room.</p>

<p>I read Bedtime for Bear to Lin and Mikarin and then lights out at
10pm, just before a young girl started wailing crying.  She eventually
cried herself out, but apparently started again at midnight, according
to Lin.  This bear was sleeping by then and did not notice.</p>
