Ma came to the baggage claim area to wait for me! We took the subway (subterrainian electric vehicle that ran on rails that looked relatively light) to the hotel and got some food there. I marveled at the size of the portions, but there was no in-flight meal so I finished what we ordered.
The veggie burger tasted somewhat like raw meat. Not sure if I would have enjoyed it if I thought it was real meat.</description>

This morning Colleen woke me up at 6:40 as I hoped to leave by 7am for the airport. I was shocked to know Ryan had already left; I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice him at all while I was sleeping.
I am grateful that Colleen woke me up after I had not set an alarm or anything; I was just able to conk out asleep last night and she handled all the details.</description>

      <description>17:18 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 (SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil) 23:19 Sunday 31 December 2017 +04 (Dubai - United Arab Emirates) 04:20 Monday 01 January 2018 JST (Tokyo - Japan) We arrived and went to the baggage claim but, fortunately thanks to Lin checking first, we discovered we could not get our checked baggage in Dubai when staying in hotels in the airport.
But what&amp;rsquo;s awesome: the guy was like beep beep beep and said our baggage would be redirected to Haneda just like that boom.</description>

      <description>23:16 Saturday 30 December 2017 -02 I think we thought the flight leaves at 00:15, in which case we would begin boarding in 20 minutes or so. But it&amp;rsquo;s at 01:15 so we have 80 minutes or so.
Lin is shopping for souvenirs though our bags are overweight, and will apparently cost $100 in Dubai because *they are very strict there&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <title>headed to GRU airport</title>

      <description>10:43 Tuesday 19 December 2017 -02 En route to GRU via taxi from Rodrigo&amp;rsquo;s aparment. I trust we are on time; our flight is at 12:45pm and the airport is apparently 14 kilometers from here. Traffic has started moving briskly; we are traveling at 80 km/h, so we should ostensibly arrive in less than 14 minutes, so I guess we are good. It&amp;rsquo;s a domestic flight so maybe less stringent through security.</description>
