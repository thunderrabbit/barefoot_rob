<p>Ma came to the baggage claim area to wait for me!  We took the subway
(subterrainian electric vehicle that ran on rails that looked
relatively light) to the hotel and got some food there.  I marveled at
the size of the portions, <!-- and smiled at Meghan's braces, --> but
there was no in-flight meal so I finished what we ordered.</p>

<p>The veggie burger tasted somewhat like raw meat.  Not sure if I would
have enjoyed it if I thought it was real meat.</p>

<p>Ma and I did some real talk about when she and Dad divorced, so that
was nice.</p>

<p>She told me about a play that Jon is in, where his character actually
sits in the audience and interrupts the play near the end.</p>

<p>That sounds amazing, so I hope I can watch it sometime.</p>

<p>I am tired and writing this while sleepy; I am going to take a shower
and go to bed.  I do not have wifi access yet, so will have to take
care of that in the morning.</p>

<p>This morning Colleen woke me up at 6:40 as I hoped to leave by 7am for
the airport.  I was shocked to know Ryan had already left; I didn&rsquo;t
notice him at all while I was sleeping.</p>

<p>I am grateful that Colleen woke me up after I had not set an alarm or
anything; I was just able to conk out asleep last night and she
handled all the details.</p>

<p>Traffic was super smooth toward the airport and smooth experience from
baggage check-in out on the curb to quite polite TSA agents in through
the gates.  Thank you, SEA-TAC!</p>

<p>We arrived and went to the baggage claim but, fortunately thanks to
Lin checking first, we discovered we could <em>not</em> get our checked
baggage in Dubai when staying in hotels in the airport.</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s awesome: the guy was like beep beep beep and said our
baggage would be redirected to Haneda just like that boom. Automatic
scanners and stuff.  I know it&rsquo;s both amazing and meh, makes sense.
Also awesome: we thereby did not have to pay a fee for overweight bags
despite this airport allegedly being strict.</p>

<p>We had to go through security again, but I guess we couldn&rsquo;t get our
bags because they don&rsquo;t want us to escape into the city without visas,
which we don&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>Lin bought eyeliner during our 15+ minute walk to the hotel in
Concourse C, and is buying a T-shirt (and probably other stuff) now.
I showered and considered shaving but nah it can wait until we get
back.</p>

<p>I think we thought the flight leaves at 00:15, in which case we would
begin boarding in 20 minutes or so.  But it&rsquo;s at 01:15 so we have 80
minutes or so.</p>

<p>Lin is shopping for souvenirs though our bags are overweight, and will
apparently cost $100 in Dubai because *they are very strict there&rdquo;</p>

<p>En route to GRU via taxi from Rodrigo&rsquo;s aparment.  I trust we are on
time; our flight is at 12:45pm and the airport is apparently 14
kilometers from here.  Traffic has started moving briskly; we are
traveling at 80 km/h, so we should ostensibly arrive in less than 14
minutes, so I guess we are good.  It&rsquo;s a domestic flight so maybe less
stringent through security.</p>

<h2 id="10-47-tuesday-19-december-2017-02">10:47 Tuesday 19 December 2017 -02</h2>

<p>Now traveling 120 km/h so I am sure we will be fine.</p>

<h2 id="13-16-tuesday-19-december-2017-02">13:16 Tuesday 19 December 2017 -02</h2>

<p>We made it to the gate right at boarding time.  The taxi ride to the
airport was fine, but then we had to wait in line for 30 minutes to
pay extra for a big bag full of presents and stuff.</p>
