      <description>19:03 Sunday 17 June 2018 JST Went to SOGO with everyone and then Cookie Time with Aki, but the line was too long for her so we bounced. Said bye to her at the station and then went back for cookies! Bought a shake, but it was more like blended milk than blended ice cream. Bought a lemon cookie for Lin and headed home.
&amp;ldquo;Oh I forgot my water bottle&amp;rdquo; so I headed back to the park and saw Menya and them leaving the park.</description>

      <description>21:53 Monday 13 June 2016 JST Haha so Lin was painting her desk today and Jennie jumped onto it! Jennie was like, &amp;ldquo;oh sticky!!&amp;rdquo; and ran away, leaving white cat prints on the hardwood floors. Hilarious!
Lin cleaned the feet, the prints, and now we have fun little matte spots on the otherwise glossy hardwood floor.
Fortunately, Lin didn&amp;rsquo;t try to wash the oil based paint of the brushes with water.</description>
