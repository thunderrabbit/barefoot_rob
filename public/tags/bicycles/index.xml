      <description>15:58 Sunday 28 April 2019 JST Today we got our bicycle parking passes, which we applied for in June 2016. I bought a 3 month pass. Lin got 1 month because she is less certain she will like riding more than walking/bussing because of the hills between our place and the station.
I figure 3 months will give me a pretty good sense of how much I like biking to the station (bicycle parking area).</description>
