(transcribed from Book Two of my diary)
I was beaten soundly by Mr Bandecca 4 or 5 games in a row. I kinda felt bad, since he had commented about how he wanted a workout, not to just piss around.. He was very nice about it, and I believe sincere when he said he enjoyed playing. That&amp;rsquo;s cool.
Last night I got a call from Cheri, who said she was going out with some guy who&amp;rsquo;s 31, apparently a real charmer, he&amp;rsquo;s made comments about her nice blonde hair &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;good proportions&amp;rdquo; and commented that he&amp;rsquo;d like to take pictures of her.</description>

Yesterday when I called Christina she was gone. When I called Charmain, she didn&#39;t want to do anything. so I rode around at the school. Today I went to church. Jessica, Cheri, and Emily were there. We talked about AIDS. Dad brought some rubbers there to show us them and teach us about &#34;safe sex.&#34; As if we don&#39;t know.</description>

I just wrote 2 letters. To Christy and Erika. I just got one from Lila. You know what? Lila is awesome! I love her personality and she&#39;s into guys and sex and she gives good back massages... Wow! And I&#39;m gonna get her at OKC. I can&#39;t believe she&#39;s 15 though. I would swear she&#39;s older than me. goodnight. 10:28</description>
