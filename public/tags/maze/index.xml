      <description>18:44 Tuesday 15 December 2015 JST Like the little maze I received because it was broken, but a lot bigger, there&amp;rsquo;s a cool rotating maze at the toy store. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially two radial mazes side by side, with two radial mazes on top of them, geared together so they must turn in anti-unison. Two balls live under plexiglass fixed to the top of the upper mazes and the goal is to get them out, through two holes in the plexiglass.</description>

      <description>18:19 Tuesday 29 September 2015 JST Yoshie canceled her lesson today, so I decided to work on a maze instead. I&amp;rsquo;m starting with a piece I had started already.
19:36 Tuesday 29 September 2015 JST I just finished a piece I&amp;rsquo;ve titled &amp;ldquo;One Teleport Maze&amp;rdquo; because, if it&amp;rsquo;s a maze, and if the start and end points are the bulbous areas in opposite corners, and if the dots are teleports, and if the paths are either the black paths or the swirly paths, I can solve it by using a single teleport.</description>

      <description>22:48 Monday 11 May 2015 JST Today I finally(!) finished a maze for Darcey! Actually I want to put a new background on it, but if I can&amp;rsquo;t find one, it&amp;rsquo;s finished!
Hopefully I remember to upload it tonight to amazeaweek and to my image server.</description>

Hmmm! I received a request on Fiverr from a guy asking for a maze on a postcard to be mailed to his friend.
He suggested a maze like the one I made for a guy on Reddit (no internet access to find the link right now), which starts in the center and then has four arms radiating outward in different directions.
The latest request was to make the maze on the card look like a small part of a larger maze.</description>

Though it&amp;rsquo;s not as smooth as I had hoped, I got a maze made with my gradient on https://www.easystereogrambuilder.com/3d-stereogram-maker.aspx.
If you can&amp;rsquo;t solve the stereogram, look at the mask for the maze.
I think the stereogram z-dimension curves look a lot steeper than the mask.</description>

I spent a few hours working on the 3D maze I started about a week ago. There must be a faster way, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how exactly. Basically for each part of the maze that goes over another part, I make that section its own layer so it can be &amp;ldquo;above&amp;rdquo; the lower layers. Then for each part that goes under another party, I make that its own section so it can be &amp;ldquo;below&amp;rdquo; the upper layers.</description>
