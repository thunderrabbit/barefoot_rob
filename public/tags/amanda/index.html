<p class=date>21:31 Friday 11 September 1998</p>

<p>Today started last night for me.  Manda came over and we talked and chilled and she had brought some Japanese crab burritos or something like that:  Crab, celery, rice, all rolled into a burrito shape with seaweed as the wrapper.  Good stuff.  She ate them mostly with soy sauce, I ate them mostly plain.

<p>Then she showed me the green stuff that came with the meal.  Looks kinda like play-doh.  A bit squishier.. maybe like hummus.

<p>But play-doh is salty, and hummus tastes a bit tangy.  This green stuff was hot.

<p>Oh yes! I recognized Lucian had a tube of this at Con Con!  Like a toothpaste tube, but I wouldn't try brushing my teeth with it. I took a splot of it on my finger.

<p>"This is for Lucian," and smeared it fully onto my tongue and squished it around my mouth <i>ohmygod</i>.  I closed my eyes and zoned on the sensation.  

<p>Tears poured out my eyes. If I breathed wrong, the vapor sizzled my nose... WOW.  To a dull burning the feeling chilled and then began to subside.  I squished the saliva around my mouth and swallowed it all down.

<p>Yeah.

<p>Manda was wide eyed like, "wow."

<p>We finished the burrito things (what <i>are</i> they called?) and at the end the green goop was left.  I smooshed it around with the chopsticks and tasted the hot residue on the sticks.  Hmm.  Again?

<p>Some twisted part of me said "yes" even though Manda was all, "'stotally up to you."  I got a bigger blob than Lucian had done at Con Con. I pondered it..  It only took 10 minutes last time; this couldn't take more than 15.  Smeared it on my tongue and onto the roof of my mouth.

<p><i>sizzle</i> went my tongue.  <i>ha ha</i> went the green stuff.  <i>eeep</i> went the burning sensation through my nose.
My eyes cried and I meditated on the whole process again.  mmmmm

<p>damn that was hot. Even now as I type, 24 hours later, I can still feel my tongue is raw.  Crazy stuff.  Try it!

<p>But what happened all day today?  Houston flooded.  That's what I originally intended to write about.  See the next entry.

<p class=date>April 4, 4:40P.M.</p>

<p>Yesterday Erin left for Oklahoma.  I was going to go see a movie
with Charmain, but she didn't get a ride.  So we didn't.  I was
supplying the money and she was gettin' a ride.  I fell asleep in
front of the T.V. last night.  At 3AM. it went off the air.  This woke
me up.- Weird part: <em>I could not feel my arms</em>.  I mean <b>not
at all.</b>  I could only drag them around.  I couldn't move them.  I
had to literally look for my right arm to see where that dude was.  I
sent a letter to Amanda and Rachel today.  Yesterday Amanda called.
She was totally crying and I didn't even know who it was.  I thought
it was Christina because she cries a lot and I've never heard/seen
Amanda cry.  At first I thought she said her grandmother died.  I
thought Oh Jees.  I hope she didn't say that.  Then I realized it was
Amanda and her cat had died.  I said I was sorry and everything, but
she still just bawled.  The she told me to call Rachel, and I did, and
told Rachel what happened and she said she knew.  That's all.</p>

<p>Now today has been an interesting day.  I was mowing, just cruisin'
along and singing Paul Revere, when the mower started going dead.  I
looked down and gas was pourin' out.  I was about to turn it off and
it caught on fire.  Wow!  I sorta' freaked out. Lucky dad was there.
He just got a water hose and started sprayin'.  He told me to get the
fire extinguisher.  I did and that put it out.  Later, I was scraping
the purple crap off the van windows, 'cause it's hard to see out of
them.  I was trying to take the window out, and Smash!  that dude
cracked up.  We went to Charlie's auto salvage and they didn't have
one.  We found a place that did, and we're gonna get it Monday.  Oh-
it's Saturday today.  Now I'm about to call Christina and see if I can
go over there.  I want to see how much "action" I can get, as Lila put
it.  If I can't, I'll call Charmain to see what's happenin'.  If I
don't go there, I'll ride around by the school.</p>

<p>See you later. Bye 4:59</p>
