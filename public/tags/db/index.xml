AB DB primarily consists of two big tables. Table U has 77k records, and 160 columns. Table B has maybe 40k records and maybe 70 columns. There&amp;rsquo;s a 1-to-many relationship from B to U. Doing joins on them takes about 3 or 4 seconds.
That ain&amp;rsquo;t good, considering the joins are done all the frickin time.
I guess that&amp;rsquo;s why when I got the original data, a lot of what&amp;rsquo;s now in the B table was in the U table.</description>
