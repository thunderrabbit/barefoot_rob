      <description>20:00 Monday 22 October 2018 JST I met Shraddhan in Iidabashi to hear about his Creative Capitalism game. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a full sense of how to play it, but we had fun playing a small version which resulted in six piles of 72 yen each, plus a 5 yen coin in the center.
The idea is that these will be seed money for six different projects.</description>
