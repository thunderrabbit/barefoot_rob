      <description>10:34 Sunday 14 April 2019 JST I am on the way back from Loreatec with another new battery in my computer. I replaced it back in December or so, but it never really acted right. Hopefully this one will do the right things.
Lantz offered this battery at no cost after I tried to pay him. We settled on half price.
10:40 Sunday 14 April 2019 JST Battery has gone from 36 to 31 percent in a few minutes.</description>

      <description>09:05 Monday 01 January 2018 JST The battery on my Mac is so dead that it cannot even remember the date. Today is actually April 12th, 2019, not Jan 1st, 2018.
14:09 Friday 12 April 2019 JST That&amp;rsquo;s more like it.</description>

      <description>21:11 Wednesday 15 November 2017 JST As usual, my phone battery is low after not having charged it today. I charged it at JB the past few weeks but forgot tonight.
My computer battery is charged, so I can read Michael John Grist&amp;rsquo;s rewrite of Sen&amp;rsquo;s adventures in The Saint&amp;rsquo;s Rise.
I am on page 170 or so out of 470 and had hoped to finish by 20 November. hmm.</description>

      <description>15:43 Friday 20 October 2017 JST I bought an AC adapter to use with my camera. Today I had been able to use the battery for about 90 minutes before it conked out. The adapter was 2000 yen from Amazon, but between 6000 and 8000 yen at Bic Camera and Yodobashi Camera. How will this play out in the long term? Bic Camera connect with Amazon Buy Now inside their store?</description>
