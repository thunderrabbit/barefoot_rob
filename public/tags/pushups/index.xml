      <description>01:25 Friday 15 May 2015 JST Okay, now my pushup counter uses Parse&amp;rsquo;s suggested code for logging in and saving data per user.
So, please feel free to enjoy my pushups counter!
Just click login to test it, or create your own username and password to track your own pushups!
Right now, all pushups are saved after clicking save, but the total number of pushups is not displayed. I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that soon.</description>

      <description>18:39 Wednesday 13 May 2015 JST WIthout internet access I can&amp;rsquo;t really run the pushup counter because it&amp;rsquo;s backed by parse.com and a hosted version of jquery. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to get around the parse issue, though I guess I could just store the count in local storage and turn off the variety of stats I had planned to display (# of pushups this day/month/year)&amp;hellip; or heck maybe there&amp;rsquo;s a simple JS interface to a local DB.</description>

      <description>07:28 Tuesday 12 May 2015 JST Pushups with Friends inexplicably stopped counting after 1923 pushups in one month, so I am writing my own.
https://github.com/thunderrabbit/pushups-counter-js
No readme yet as of this writing, but it&amp;rsquo;s backed by parse.com It saves each pushup one by one, but I want to add a local counter and then send them all up at once, to save wear and tear on internets and on my parse budget (currently $0).</description>
