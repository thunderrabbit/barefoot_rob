<p>Lunched with Tomoko and Yukiko (first time to meet her) at SCC,
talking about movies and fears (acrophobia, claustrophobia,
arachnophobia) and then lesson with Midori, talking about spot AC
units which do not need ducts.</p>

<p>I worked for JB at three different locations around Kawasaki Station
today, as I do every Wednesday, at Solid Square, SSC, and JB main
office.  Solid Square lesson went pretty well; we drew mind maps of
our favorite places and then said a few sentences about them.  Then I
had a break during which I Marco Poloed with Richard from ae911truth a
bit and then worked on AB, nearly finishing this ticket since it
received a bit higher priority at our last meeting.</p>

<p>SSC featured lunch with Tomoko and then she reminded me of M&rsquo;s
birthday yesterday and bought a present &ldquo;from me&rdquo; which I wrapped.
Then lesson with Tomoko and head out to JB (via bus cause it&rsquo;s kinda
raining) and I spent some time working on AB and nearly nearly got the
ticket finished.</p>

<p>Four JB lessons each Wednesday: two lessons with kids and then two
with adults.  New student in the kids lessons is pretty genki, and may
have a good effect on the others.  We had them write some letters N+1
times and then practiced language &ldquo;I have a _____&rdquo; using different
plastic fruit.  We had tried &ldquo;I have a _____&rdquo; and &ldquo;I want a _____&rdquo; but
they kept getting &ldquo;have&rdquo; and &ldquo;want&rdquo; mixed up, so I switched it to only
&ldquo;have&rdquo; because I remember not being able to distinguish the words for
library and post office for a long time because I had learned them on
the same day.</p>

<p>In second class I used the same fruit to lay out a fake city, hoping
they would enjoy giving directions with fruit as landmarks.  It did
not work as well as I hoped; they prefered playing various sports with
the plastic fruits (which I can understand, but was frustrating for a
bit).  They finally got into it a little bit, but then <em>really</em> got
interested with Kazu brought in his computer with an animated game
version of giving directions.</p>

<p>In the third class, we used past perfect(?) e.g. &ldquo;I have worked in _____
for ____&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have lived in _____&rdquo; because the language pattern
came up in their banter at the beginning of classes.</p>

<p>In the fourth class, they were not saying much, and I was getting
tired, so I invited them to tell me their favorite fairy tale in
Japanese.  They told me the story of Peach Boy.  Their version seemed
to be missing a lot of possible sub-plots; I wonder how it was
originally written.</p>

<p>I have been writing this on the train from Yako to Tsudayama, and am
feeling super tired.</p>

<p>If I had my way, I would be magically transported home from here.
Thank god for Lin who usually picks me up from our station on
Wednesdays.</p>

<p>Good some good shiz done for AB today.  Ran a DB update last night,
and this evening added some calculated fields to a page.  That was
easy enough, but adding them to the output reports will take a bit
more time to figure out.</p>

<p>Nice to see setting up SSL certificates for Apache 2 on Ubuntu is
pretty easy.  They even automagically set up a cron job to renew the
certificate after two months.  See <code>/etc/cron.d/certbot</code></p>

<p>I had a problem for a minute because one .conf file had a domain and
an alias in it.  I ran certbot for the aliased domain and told it to
go ahead and force https, but then that broke the main domain (which
was the main domain) by forcing SSL <em>and</em> using the certificates for
the test domain.</p>

<p>So I split the .conf files into two different files (This is a
technique called WET (Write Everything Twice)) which might suck for
future me, but now AB is available via https.  Noice!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll write future me a note.</p>

<pre><code>Hey future Rob

testadmin.ab.com exists as a separate file to ensure the correct SSL
certificates are used for the domain.

Feel free to wipe the domain from the map; I don't use it very often.

<p>Sigh.  Worked on AB all morning and then they were essentially like
&ldquo;yeah we don&rsquo;t like it.  Go back to the version that didn&rsquo;t function,
but looked pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand their priorities, but I switched it back.</p>

<p>Yikes my previously-used JQuery CDN isn&rsquo;t responding so I replaced it
and now the main page of the site breaks.  When did that start
happening?  What do I do?  How do I find someone to take over this
site?  (that is my real question / I do not want to maintain it forever)</p>
