<p>Although I have not gotten all the way to the part of MLAPHP that we
are supposed to be adding tests, I am close enough that I can add some
tests. They have helped a <em>lot</em>, like OMG how did I live without
tests?  It hasn&rsquo;t been so long that I don&rsquo;t remember what it was like,
and I sure like this better.</p>

<p>Right now I am working on upgrading to a new version of Datatables so
it can access <code>table.row()</code> but I get the error</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: table.row is not a function
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just not a function&hellip; <code>table.row</code> is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>Maybe 1.10.19 of datatables is not the latest after all..</p>

<p>I had a weird issue with crontab today.</p>

<p>If I editted the crontab while logged in as root, it did not work.</p>

<pre><code>$# whoami
root
$# crontab -e
   ((( make edits )))
crontab: installing new crontab
</code></pre>

<p>But the changes did not work.</p>

<pre><code>$# exit
$ whoami
ubuntu
sudo crontab -e
   ((( make edits )))
crontab: installing new crontab
</code></pre>

<p>And the changes work just fine.</p>

<p>One clear difference was user ubuntu was using nano to edit, while
user root was using emacs&hellip;  But seems weird if that would make a
difference.</p>

<p>The same cronfile was edited both times.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got it working by <code>sudo crontab -e</code> instead of having root
do <code>crontab -e</code>.</p>

<p>One of the AB cronjobs has been throwing errors, but the job is still
running.</p>

<p>I am in the middle of refactoring the code to use Dependency
Injection; I don&rsquo;t know how I broke something, but I cannot really go
back to a previous version.  Rather, I don&rsquo;t know what version to go
back to, and my local dev environment cannot recreate the error.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, my local dev environment cannot even access Ye Olde
Interneffe so I cannot easily revert local files to a previous state
anyway.</p>

<pre><code>both frontend and backend use Localizer::getInstance in these
classes. Inject it instead of reference Singleton

./Data/Unit.php
./DeviceHandler.php
./SiteHandler.php
./Template.php
./Translator.php
</code></pre>

<p>I am in the middle of doing <code>\Data\Unit</code>.  Perhaps once I finish that,
I can push, deploy, and pray.</p>

<p>There are 19 more places to change instantiations of <code>\Data\Unit</code>,
including in <code>\Factory\UnitFactory</code>.</p>

<p>I am curious if I misread or misunderstood the MLAPHP book which said
we are making small incremental changes.  This little change seems to
have blown up a bit, due to classes which instantiate <code>\Data\Unit</code> and
should eventually have its dependencies injected into them as well.</p>

<p>I have been upgrading AB&rsquo;s PHP to the standards described in
<a href="https://leanpub.com/mlaphp">Paul Jones&rsquo; Modernizing Legacy Applications in PHP</a>.
So far I am still in the Autoloading section, but have done nearly
half of the classes.  Almost all of the &ldquo;data&rdquo; classes are done, but
none of the search or factory classes are done.</p>

<p>(I put data in quotes above because I think that is just a name we
came up with ..  not sure if it has a meaning outside our project.)</p>

<p>But that is not why I am writing.  I was just reading Troy Hunt
talking about passwords and want to add the HIBP password check to the
site.  I am glad we do not really limit the passwords (much; we do
crop them at a few hundred characters, but I now know to not do that),
but I am not sure I can get buy-in to require everyone to have good
passwords.</p>

<p>I am thinking I will log if passwords have been cracked, but that may
be a security issue itself.  Not sure.</p>

<p>Still going through MLAPHP for the AB project.  I guess I am about
halfway through the step of naming all the class definition files so
they can be loaded via the autoloader.</p>

<p>During this process I found <a href="https://www.mabl.com/">Mabl</a> which
features a short domain name and some tools for automated testing.
Pretty easy onboarding, and they are giving the site a good onceover
every day.</p>

<p>Eventually need to create a staging system with fake data so they can
give the backend a daily look as well.</p>

<p>Today I got to hear about the production of silicone for the first

<p>I found a solution to all my work woes.</p>

<pre><code>I just had an interesting thought about my computer job, which I
brought up in the meeting on Monday.  My website client is AB.

It is likely that I can find a company that can do the work I am
doing for less money, but it's not possible to secretly act as a
middle man and keep the money due to how payments are done now.

The value for me overall is to reduce the load of this job, which
taxes me physically and emotionally.

Value for AB is to have a real company (Engine Yard) doing the
tedious work I've been doing, and therefore if I die, AB isn't
fucked by losing all their server/website knowledge.

I'll have to do some research, but I can probably still do the fun
part of the job and leave the annoying part to Engine Yard.
</code></pre>

<p>Yay! Why didn&rsquo;t I think of this before?  I heard of them ages ago at
an iOS meeting.  If they can handle the server stuff, that would make
my life sooo much easier.</p>

<p>So I looked up their website
<a href="https://www.engineyard.com/">https://www.engineyard.com/</a></p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/2018_oct_05_engine_yard_does_ruby.png"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2018/thumbs/2018_oct_05_engine_yard_does_ruby.png" alt="2018 oct 05 engine yard does ruby" /></a></p>

<p>Ruby????</p>

<p>Aw man!</p>

<p>I need someone to deal with PHP!</p>

<p>A couple days later, I found that someone is me.</p>

<p>I found
<a href="https://leanpub.com/mlaphp">Modernizing Legacy Applications in PHP</a>
shows how to go from spaghetti to modern framework <em>including unit tests</em>,
without any downtime.</p>

<p>My code is <em>not</em> as bad as the code in the examples, which includes
MySQL and HTML and CSS in the same file, but I definitely suffer from
lack of tests, so rely on crossing my fingers and praying each time I
deploy.</p>

<hr />

<p>While writing this entry, I found I can wrap my app in Ruby Hooks to
deploy it
<a href="https://www.engineyard.com/blog/deploying-php-applications-on-engine-yard-a-how-to">https://www.engineyard.com/blog/deploying-php-applications-on-engine-yard-a-how-to</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181004234913/https://www.engineyard.com/blog/deploying-php-applications-on-engine-yard-a-how-to">https://web.archive.org/web/20181004234913/https://www.engineyard.com/blog/deploying-php-applications-on-engine-yard-a-how-to</a></p>

<p>I will clean up the code first, then see what&rsquo;s up with outsourcing
the server side.</p>

<p>BH set up a Slack space for MKP Japan where we can discuss creating
the organization and setting up some trainings.</p>

<p>I got a multi-month fix done for AB; now users can use the same filter
on their custom list page as they can on the main list.  I don&rsquo;t
recall why it was set up this weird way before, but it is better now.
Oh, and they now have a recycle bin function on the custom list page
so it is easier to hide and restore things from their list.  (It used
to take 3 clicks to hide an item (and they could not be restored) but
now it takes 1 click to hide an item, 1 click to reveal hidden items,
and 1 click to restore each hidden item)</p>

<p>And I glued a single stick in place for Marble Track 3.  It is the
first stick that will be used as a support for the Outer Spiral.</p>

<p>Bah.  I&rsquo;ve been working for like 12 or 16 hours trying to figure out
how to keep a button visible, but I cannot figure out this spaghetti
of code, domains, css, and browsers to figure out what is hiding it.</p>
