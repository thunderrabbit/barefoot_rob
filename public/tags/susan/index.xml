      <description>21:17 Saturday 30 January 2016 CST After the wedding ceremony, we all headed to steak dinner at McCormick and Schmicks, where we were all graciously hosted by Ma&amp;rsquo;s friend Susan.
Super cool that kT and Susan have (had) jobs in similar sectors so they chatted in secret code about that for a while.
Susan has written a book called Bench-Pressed, which she felt compelled to write after serving as a judge within the immigration system in the US.</description>
