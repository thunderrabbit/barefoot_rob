<p class=date>11:30am Tuesday 4 August 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>Woke up and read part of <em>Shield</em> and talked to Torger and Galen and others on staff out on our cabin porch. Then breakfast and sat at the same table with mostly the same group as dinner last night. We talked and chilled a bit and bounced a plastic ring from a coke bottle plastic cap.

<p>At the Spirt Circle I sat between Carol and Jeremy who sang "Greasy Grimey Gopher Guts" for everyone.  Well he started it but didn't remember quite all the lyrics..

<p>I made an announcement encouraging people to write in what we in the Southwest District call the "Big Gray Rally Book," a YRUU diary that is actually volume II. I started volume 1 back in July 1996 at the New Orleans Rally.

<p>Then someone (I think Allison or maybe Mimi) led the "Happy Boy" song, which I didn't know, but many people did and sang along with it.  Something about a dead dog and his guts in a jar.

<p>During the Growth Stages workshop, we did a bonding game and had a ten minute nap, during which I actually fell asleep!  Nice.
Then we shared stories about our first memories before 5 years old.

                        <p><title>Con Con</title></p>

<p class=date>4pm Tuesday 4 August 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>Lunch then chilled and we had a fire drill, bringing everyone to the volley ball court downhill from all the cabins. 

<p>The fire drill was also a sneaky way to get us all assembled for a big ConCon group photo (which I should most certainly scan and put on the web!) for which Jeremy sat on my shoulders.

<p>Then I arrived late for the adult check-in meeting but it was all good and afterward I said HI and talked to Kathryn, advisor from this area. We talked for quite a while. I had kicked off the conversation with, "what do you think happens after we die?"

<p>She gave her thoughts, and I mine, and the conversation spun off to my high school shyness transformation into college craziness and YRUU advising and dream flying and OOBE and awareness of the world in general.  Now we are going to walk to the creek.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>Kathryn is encouraging me to apply for an Adult-at-large position on Youth Council. Part of me is going, "yeah, but" and I am scared to do it but don't know why.

<p>I believe I can do Youth Council and local youth work. I can do it. She just gave me privacy to write.

<p>I told her I had applied for the adult coordinator position for this ConCon. I didn't make it, but that doesn't mean I should try again. What if I quit trying to walk when I fell the first time?

<p>Ah- here it is -- I'm continually wanting to be "experienced" to be grown up..  I want to do "that" (whatever someone else has already done) instead of recognizing that this moment, each moment *is* my experience. My experience is continually unfolding before me.

<p>I'm gonna go for it. I'll talk to Jen Harrison and apply and go for it!

<p class=date>9:20am Monday 3 August 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>I'm in seat 24A of Continental flight 1989 about to leave for ConCon. Celine Dion's "My heart will go on" is playing quietly over the speakers as two boys with English accents talk with their parents behind me, including "if I sit heah, I con't see tha TV."

<p>This weekend I got all my planned activities complete, including transcribing all my SWUUSI journal entries, updating the Houston YRUU (pronounced "why are you you" short for Young Religious Unitarian Universalists) webpage, seeing my mom preach at Thoreau Congregation, and attending the youth worship last night, during which we decided to create a Houston YAC (Youth-Adult Committee) which can make the decisions that need to be made for the YRUU activities in the Houston area.

<p>On Saturday I went to Maggie and John's and met Wende out there for dinner and ate then left around 9pm and met Manda at IHOP after going to say HI to Rebecca at Indigo Angel who wasn't there so I left a note.

<p>Manda and I went to a park and chilled and swung on swings and climbed and slid down slides and rocked on a huge rocking gazebo and talked till like 1:30am. I went home and got to bed around 2am.

<p>The plane is now taxiing slowly through the terminal area.

<p>Last night I did a panic pack, including depositing checks and withdrawing cash, purchasing film and razors at Walgreen's, and finally got all my stuff packed and went to bed at 5am.

<p>Awake at 7am and Manda drove me to the airport and now I'm on the plane and here I am.

<p class=date>11pm Monday 3 August 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>Arrived at the airport from Phoenix after 1 hour flight during which I slept most of the way. I woke at the end to see Ian F (I like the pun "E 'n F") who I met at GA and his sister Kathleen.

<p>Bryan Beck said HI while we were waiting for baggage and then we sat with the pile of youth after collecting Ian and Kathleen's stuff.

<p>I rode on the second bus and met and remet youth: Lucian, Zara, Laura, Laura, Jenny, Chelsea, Chris, Duncan, Brendan, Jeff.. we pretty much only had one person per seat so that was cool.

<p>On the way up the mountain we had to stop once to let the bus cool off and I took a picture that included two road signs: 

<p><pre>ICY</pre>

<p>and

<p><pre>
ROCK
SLIDE
AREA
</pre>

<p>As we pulled into the campground, I was <em>amazed</em> at how small of a road the bus driver drove through.  wow!  <em>CRUNCH</em> as we turned a corner and hit the side of something <em>CRACK</em> as a 2 inch tree branch wacked the side of the bus..

<p>We all stepped off the bus amidst huge applause from those who had already arrived. I got hugs from Southwest District Youth Bryan Beck, Melissa Cain, Maia Cudhea, Jeremy Loomis-Norris, Nathan Ryan, and Emily Stainer (we have a YAC quorum!) and got my picture taken and my nametag made and my secret buddy bag made and talked and talked.  Had dinner with Zara, Cat, Ian, Fannie, Chris, and Arnie (who spelled his name R-Knee) and taught them all the cup game.

<p>At advisor meeting, Bobby handed out trinkets and then we had the main ConCon welcome meeting during which I fell asleep.

<p>Touchgroup meetings at 11pm.  Mine met at Cabin 7: Mara, Kaity, Kathryn, Jenny, Zach, Jeremy, Lucian, and Mimi. We talked and then exchanged favorite music tastes and I got some cool ideas for ambient and stuff.  I'm tired and am going to bed.

<p class=date>Monday 3 August 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>On the ground below I can see huge block letters of green (trees?) on brown dirt background:

<pre>LUECKI</pre>

<p>I wonder what the heck it means (city name?) or where it is...

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>We've been flying for about an hour and I'm seeing some intricate roadways that look like an old circuit board.  Pretty cool, but the weird thing is they don't see to go anywhere. The road ends, but there's nothing there.

<p>But I'm writing now because I think I just saw a particle accelerator, though I don't know of any in this area.  It was perfectly round, not cleared in the middle, and big. I don't really have a way to judge how big, but I'd guess 1/2 mile to a mile across.

<p>(I asked the pilot about it as I left. He didn't know for sure, but suggested it was a mine.  hmmm.)

<p class=date>23 August 1988</p>

<p>
I got back from ConCon 2 days ago.  It was so incredible.  There is simply no way of fully describing ConCon - so I won't do it.  But I will of course tell about some of the stuff I did.
<p>
On August 15 my flight was at 12:20PM and I got there with 45 minutes to spare.  I changed planes in Dallas Love Field after a 50 minute flight.  My next flight was from 1:45 to 2:35.  I met up with a bunch of SW District peoples at Dallas.  Joe K, Gayle K, Rockin' Robin D, Deborah D, Paul K, and a couple other people.  We got to Tulsa and ConCon people identified us easily.  Tie dye shirts, Mr. Happy Condom ("Dress well for every occasion") shirts, juggling balls, riped up pants... So they took us to the baggage claim.  I had no baggage so I continued to where our shuttles (cars of nice UU adults) were to pick us up.
<p>
I got on the next shuttle with 3 other youth.  We were driven to the YMCA where we waited until the bus to take us to the camp.  At the Y, I saw Kelly H again. Actually she saw me first and waded through people to give me a huge hug. She sat on my lap and we talked about old times.
<p>
Eventually there were calls of, "the bus is here!!" echoing through the building.  We piled out of the room to get to the elevator. By the time I got my bags it was almost full but I said, "well, just take my bags" and I slowly put them in the elevator.  Just as the door was closing, I jumped in myself.  There was a big guy in there who was quite impressed. I would later know him as "Donny" (spelled Donne I think) from Michigan.
<p>
We got on the bus which was <b>very hot</b>, like no air condition, and drove for about 1 hour to the camp.  We were the first bus there and we got off in a happy daze. We were directed to the Beacon House to register & choose our workshop. Then we went to the Jet to get our Secret Buddies & make buttons and our mailbag.  My button looked like this:
<pre>

         CON^2 88
         MR. COOL
          yellow
            Rob
              N
</pre>
<p>
except it was yellow and the words were handwritten.
<p>
The workshop that I signed up for was the ropes course.  It was really super incredible. I'll tell about that first.
<p>
Ok- the first day we did different trust things - Trust Falls, Wind in the Willow.  That was neat.  Then we had to group together to solve a problem.  The problem was set in California during an earthquake.  We all had to get on a big wooden spool (halfway stable ground) and get to another spool (completely stable ground) by using a tire, 1/2 a cinder block, and two 10 foot boards.  The spools were 15 feet apart.  We did not have to use all the equipment.  We figured out how to do it in about 10 minutes and we did it.
<p>
The next thing involved a huge spider web (ropes).  It was set in The Dark Forest (or something like that) of JRR Tolkein's <em>The Hobbit</em>.  We had to get everybody through the web without anyone touching the web and without using and of the holes twice.  This was quite a challenge, but we did it in about 30 minutes. Oh- there were 15 people in our ropes course group.
<p>
The next problem involved a giant toothpick (10 foot tall, 10 inch wide steel pipe) sticking straight up out of the ground with 3 lifesavers (car tires) on it. Our job was to get the lifesavers off the toothpick and put them back on in a different order.  rules:  No one can touch the toothpick and only 3 people can touch on tire, 3 different people can touch another tire, and 3 different people can touch the last tire.  We did it.  Chuck and I were bases to get people up high enough to get the tires off and on.
<p>
The last low ground thing we did was the trust walk.  This consisted of 2 X 6 boards bolted to posts in the ground.  We were blindfolded and walked on the 2 inch edge of the 2 X 6s with people holding our hands and telling us where to put our feet.  That was interesting.  Especially since we had people going the opposite direction at the same time.
<p>
This is kinda what the course looked like from above:
<pre>


        |----|
        |    |1
        |    |___
        |       / 
        |      /_____
        |        ____
        |    ___/ 
        |___/ 
          2 

</pre>
Sections 1 and 2 were really steep.
<p>
Also, there were different levels where the boards met - like you would have to step up or down to get to the next board.  After we did all of the low stuff, we were ready for the high ropes course!
<p>
I was the third person to go through it, not including the instructor, Mike, who showed us how.  The course started about 30 feet high in a tree.  We had to use a ladder to get up.  First you walk up a really steep log about 15 feet long.  It was at about a 40 degree angle.  Then we walked along a 3 wire bridge about 60 feet long. Then along a 50 foot long 2 wire bridge.  The next thing was called the cat walk.  It consisted of 2 wires side by side about 1 1/2 feet apart.  It was 12 feet long and 30 feet in the air. (The 3 line bridge started at 35 feet and went down to 30 feet.  The two line stayed at 30)  To cross the cat walk, we had to get down on our hands and knees and crawl across.  In the middle, we had to meow - (it was the cat walk).  Nagel got confused and barked, but that's okay.  Once we crossed that, we had to walk along a level log about 25 feet long - using no hands - just walk across. I did that easily.  Tina, the girl who belayed me was mildly impressed and commented like, "oooooh - look at him go."  I was pleased.  The next thing was a set of three logs all bolted together.  We had to walk or run or trot down them- any which way.  the last two were unsupported in the middle and kind of bounced as you walked across them.  I didn't quite trot, but I definitely went faster than walking across them.  The next thing was a pulley that you rolled down the wire with.  That was neat.  It was about 50 feet long, and we got to go zipping down that.  The last thing was "<em>The Screamer</em>."  A big swing that started about 40 feet in the air.  The wire that it was attached to was about 60 feet high.  We were all tied in and leaned forward... - a bit more, more... and  WHoooooosh!!! we went flying down and up to where we could hit a tree with our foot and then back to give Mike a "high five." Then we just swung until we were almost stopped.  Then some guys slowed us down and unhooked us.  That was so neat.

The last part of the ropes course was at the two towers. Each tower consisted of 3 telephone poles like this:  (top view)

The pole (0) was about 30 feet tall and about 8 feet from the wire (----).
<p>

The two towers were about 60 feet apart.  We climbed on of the towers and rappeled back down.  Normally we would used the zip cord but it was past its warranty date.  That would have been excellent - but oh well.  I climbed and rappelled 3 times.  The last time I got all the way down in one push away from the wall.
The towers were about 35 feet high.
<p>
After I climbed the tower once, I did the last and most amazing thing there.  I had psyched myself up for about 5 minutes before I did it.  I was completely strapped in and then I was ready.
<p>
I climbed the 30 foot pole and stood on the top of it, about 9 inches in diameter.  Hanging from the wire about 8 feet in front of me was a trapeze. It hung about 1 foot below the wire.  I simply had to jump out and catch it.  I focused on the wire and everything else disappeared.  I was mentally standing on ground & I could just as easily walk out to the wire as I could pick my nose.  I just decided to jump out and catch it.  I said, "it's like gymnastics" and jumped.  I felt the trapeze hit my hands and clamped on. I made it. People below were clapping and cheering. I was happy. I did a penny drop off of the trapeze and was lowered to the ground.
<p>
To shorten the story, I'll just say only 2 other people caught the trapeze out of 12 who tried.  The three of us who did it wanted to do it again.  So we came back later in the afternoon.  Graham jumped first but didn't make it. Then Nagel went and didn't make it. I went and made it.  I was definitely Mr Cool.

     Ultimate
     frisbee in
     & had spirit
     circle


</pre>
<p>
We listened to Beastie Boys and Donne and I acted dump and danced to it.  We went outside and saw shooting stars which was kind of neat.
<p>
A typical day:<br>
Wake up, take a shower, eat, go to workshop (ropes course), go to spirit circle, lunch, free time, touch groups, supper, worship, sleep.

(3 November 1988)<br>
(It's been over 2 months so my memory is going...)<br>
I spent 3 nights up on Chapel on the Hill.  The view from there was fantastic. You could see out over a valley & part of the lake.
<p>
Chapel on the Hill was interesting in itself. It was just a metal grate floor, a podium, benches and a roof.  The floor was made of like the grate things you see in front of doors to get mud off.
Like this:

<p> the *s are metal and the rest was open air.
So it kind of hurt to walk barefoot on and was funky to sleep on, but the view in the morning was worth it.
<p>
There was a lot of cool people at ConCon<br>
<ul>
<li>Michelle B with a soft voice and nice brown eyes and sweet personality</li>
<li>Chuck G - who was in the ropes course with me and reminded me all the heck of my cousin Peter. He was a big guy.</li>
<li>Jessica B who can dance and smile and climb trees and play frisbee...</li>
<li>Delayna D with her cute as anything nose that would make her giggle when we pressed it.</li>
<li>Adam L, the most peaceful guy.. he made an announcement at spirt circle, "If something pleases you, instead of clapping, rub your hands together like this." (fingers pointing foward rub back and forth not up and down)</li>
<li>Brian M - who was always late to touchgroup was darn peaceful too.  He did a meditation too.</li>
<li>Lisa N, who ate honey while Dustin, Jack and I did our rap at 4AM on the last night.</li>
<li>Parisa P, who was my touch group leader.  She was quiet and dignified and peaceful</li>
<li>Tex - he was a short guy who was quite a riot. He rode the plane home with me. We met lots of people, and tried unsuccessfully to steal the display oxygen mask. We got caught by some lady passenger who told on us.</li>
