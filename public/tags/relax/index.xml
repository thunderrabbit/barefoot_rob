      <description>14:46 Wednesday 20 December 2017 -03 Relaxing on the beach, we got some delicious drinks: manga con leche (sp) for me and acerola for Lin. Mine was sweeet and muito deliciouso (sp).
A man came by with a young boy in his arms, and we ended up giving him R10 $3. Then other guys selling shirts, cashews, art, and maybe one more before we ended up just leaving instead of saying no no no no.</description>
