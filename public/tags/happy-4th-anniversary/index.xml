      <description>16:17 Sunday 05 July 2015 JST For our fourth anniversary, we went to a climbing gym near our house. Lin told all her co-workers how romantic I am and she thought of the idea and researched the location.
We had a fun climbing and watching a young boy be taught how to climb (and respect his teacher).
I got a few rips on my fingers from gripping the easy level grips on the walls which ranged from 85 degrees to 120 degrees.</description>
