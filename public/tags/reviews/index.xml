Snakes on a Plane
is pretty much a ridiculous movie, but I guess it could give a few shocky moments to those afraid to fly or those afraid hang out with snakes, or those simply afraid to do both at the same time.
There&amp;rsquo;s a few funny lines, well one&amp;hellip; but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t memorable enough for me to remember it. I do remember a great slew of things that simply could not have happened.</description>
