      <description>18:44 Wednesday 11 March 2015 JST  for each kind of nonce
 What does &amp;ldquo;nonce&amp;rdquo; mean in this context? I thought it was a single-use secret number, but it looks like you mean token.. ??
 select the method based on tokens present
 Basically that&amp;rsquo;s what I did: put tokens in the string and make the script brute force through every combination, substituting values in from lists.</description>

(written 10:28 Saturday 28 February 2015) I finished my livemd5 cheater; it went more smoothly than I expected!
In just tens of seconds it can spew hundreds of strings with md5 (hex) hashes which regex match any three digits at the end of the string e.g. /123$/
Too bad everyone else has nearly abandoned the md5sum live count!</description>

      <description>23:07 Monday 23 February 2015 JST Today I made a repo to help find particular md5 strings for Counting with md5sum. It&amp;rsquo;s my live md5 command line cheater.
Also gave 10000 bit tip to a man who announced his wife was pregnant.
And am working on a maze for Angelos, and printed a logo for a photo at Shibuya Crossing tomorrow.
Okay good night!</description>

To simplify Counting with md5sum, I wrote a little javascript thing to recursively look for required md5 strings. Travis wrote a different version which I modified to make it recursive. He had done things like &amp;ldquo;use strict&amp;rdquo; and maybe something else I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done.
Once we got to 100, no one posted for a month. I posted a few:

On the way home from Charu and Toru&amp;rsquo;s house now. Lin is sleeping beside me because her phone is dead (because I used a lot of its battery power to have Wifi while at their house).
I&amp;rsquo;m adding some not-very-extendable code to the md5 cheater thing: it will allow selecting which characters to convert. It&amp;rsquo;s not extendable because I&amp;rsquo;ve just hard coded three sets:</description>
