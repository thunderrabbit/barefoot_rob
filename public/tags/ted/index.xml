      <description>16:07 Tuesday 29 May 2018 JST Liz Gilbert Your Elusive Creative Genius  What elements do you think make this a “quintessential” talk?  Not sure what you mean by the talk being quintessential; I think it&amp;rsquo;s inspired and probably true, but it is not better than other talks on TED.
 What’s your opinion on this talk?  Great to see a &amp;ldquo;famous&amp;rdquo; artist be humble and real about her fears and modeling how she intends to continue doing her work because it&amp;rsquo;s her work.</description>

      <description>16:42 Monday 28 May 2018 JST Actually as I write this, I have only watched the first talk and not answered questions yet, but let&amp;rsquo;s see..
How I teach kids to love science  What elements do you think make this a “solutions” talk?  He presented problems to students who created solutions at least for collecting data in the case of nuclear stuff.
 What’s your opinion on this talk?</description>

      <description>15:30 Wednesday 08 April 2015 JST Ted went outside a couple days ago and hasn&amp;rsquo;t come back. After a discussion about who&amp;rsquo;s more interested in having Ted come back and what&amp;rsquo;s the best way to &amp;ldquo;make&amp;rdquo; him come back, I went outside with Lin as she called his name and tried to coax him out from wherever he may be, which we assume is near our house.
Didn&amp;rsquo;t find him which didn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me.</description>

      <description>22:19 Monday 06 April 2015 JST I apparently left the sliding glass door unlocked yesterday; Ted opened it and got outside. He hasn&amp;rsquo;t come back, though we&amp;rsquo;ve seen him on the balcony opposite ours.
Jennie and Ted usually sleep in the bed with Lin, and sometimes with me, but last night Jennie slept in the bed reserved for cats.
And today when ママ came home, Jennie bolted out the door, looking for Ted, I&amp;rsquo;m sure!</description>
