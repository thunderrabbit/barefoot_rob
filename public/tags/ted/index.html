<ul>
<li>What elements do you think make this a “quintessential” talk?</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure what you mean by the talk being quintessential; I think it&rsquo;s
inspired and probably true, but it is not <em>better</em> than other talks on TED.</p>

<ul>
<li>What’s your opinion on this talk?</li>
</ul>

<p>Great to see a &ldquo;famous&rdquo; artist be humble and real about her fears and
modeling how she intends to continue doing her work because it&rsquo;s her work.</p>

<ul>
<li>How would you summarize this talk in a sentence?</li>
</ul>

<p>I take care of the quantity, God takes care of the quality.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you think this idea was chosen as an idea worth spreading?</li>
</ul>

<p>We need more creative solutions in the world.</p>

<ul>
<li>Had you seen this talk before? If so, what effect has it had on you?</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep on swimming.</p>

<ul>
<li>What action can you take after watching this talk?</li>
</ul>

<p>Be glad I am doing my creative work as well.

<p>Engaging, funny, interesting, relatable, eye-opening.</p>

<p>Thoughts come through us, not from us.</p>

<p>More people need to try to stop taking their thoughts so seriously.</p>

<p>nope</p>

<p>Ted went outside a couple days ago and hasn&rsquo;t come back.  After a
discussion about who&rsquo;s more interested in having Ted come back and
what&rsquo;s the best way to &ldquo;make&rdquo; him come back, I went outside with Lin
as she called his name and tried to coax him out from wherever he may
be, which we assume is near our house.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t find him which didn&rsquo;t surprise me.  I wish Lin could just trust
he&rsquo;s happy with his decision and let him come back if/as he deigns to
do so.</p>

<p>I apparently left the sliding glass door unlocked yesterday; Ted
opened it and got outside.  He hasn&rsquo;t come back, though we&rsquo;ve seen him
on the balcony opposite ours.</p>

<p>Jennie and Ted usually sleep in the bed with Lin, and sometimes with
me, but last night Jennie slept in the bed reserved for cats.</p>

<p>And today when ママ came home, Jennie bolted out the door, looking for
Ted, I&rsquo;m sure!</p>

<p>Lin texted me tonight, saying Jennie got out.  Lin&rsquo;s pretty sad and
worried, but she&rsquo;s never had cats before.  I&rsquo;m on the way home so I&rsquo;ll
find out soon the latest feline antics!</p>
