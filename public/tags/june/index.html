<li>I met Yuri Logo today to talk about making a logo for my brand.
She was recommended by Rin so I was like yay!  She asked lots of
questions and said she had good ideas for it.  I could see in her
smile the excitement and I felt good about that.</li>
<li>I will be working with Rin in a life coaching capacity.  I look
forward to an accountability partner and learning some new
facilitation techniques.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com">Marble Track 3 website</a> now has a
Construction section, which shows some of the snippets.  Not all
the snippets are there, and they are not all fully fleshed out yet,
but I look forward to finishing that section, especially if I can
do it via a data file which can be parsed in differen ways.</li>
<li>Lin has been enjoying her new job and will soon get to have flex
time hours, going from 10am to 6pm.  Hopefully the trains will be a
bit less packed in the mornings.</li>
<li>We bought a laser printer recently.  I did it out of frustration of
buying tons of ink for the inkjet printer, and now I realize what a
great investment it is.  Now I can print pages like wheeee instead
of having a gut wrenching wonder if I would get streaks in the
pages.</li>
<li>I used the printer to print a flyer for our Japanese workshop
coming up in July.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some people could not scan the QR code, so I made one with a normal
square QR code <a href="https://b.robnugen.com/mkpjapan/workshops/2019/Japanese_Journey_of_Heart_July_square_QR_code_2019.png">https://b.robnugen.com/mkpjapan/workshops/2019/Japanese_Journey_of_Heart_July_square_QR_code_2019.png</a></p>

<ol>
<li>I just recently decided to plan on attending a workshop in Houston
in October.  (ShadowWork Facilitator Training) I have not gotten it
sorted out with the organizer yet; I asked him if I have the
prerequisites.</li>
<li>I bought <a href="https://wanb.us/">https://wanb.us/</a> which I might use for my Urbit star, ~wanbus.</li>
<li>I created a template for something like a Five Minute Journal
(which takes more than five minutes, but gives a structure to what
I write).  Kinda like a captain&rsquo;s log, tracking some different
metrics: eating, sleeping, meditation, books, exercise, kisses</li>
<li>I got the idea from Hiro, who has apparently been doing it for years.</li>
<li>After doing these for a few days, I thought it would be cool to be
able to print customized templates for people.  So if you have a
template you&rsquo;d like to print, send it to me and I can print it
out.</li>
<li>I think my knee chair has got to go cause it might be hurting my
knees and hips. I wanna get a yoga ball chair (again).  I will
request one on Freecycling Tokyo.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s now June 5th.  Yesterday I did my first session with Rin, and
came out with seven affirmations, organically discovered by doing
a (n apparently NLP) process that could be called &ldquo;What do I
gain?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What do I gain by not following my dreams?&rdquo;  (snip long chain of
answers and question repetitions featuring new answer) &ldquo;I know
people love me.&rdquo;  Wait, what??</li>
<li>It also makes sense though, in my experience of facilitating
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk&rdquo; hundreds of times.  When I go through that series
of questions, I end up with &ldquo;I will be alone&rdquo; (which is about the
opposite of &ldquo;I know people love me.&rdquo;</li>

<li>I just got home from
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Apocrypha/events/249933126/">Apocrypha #15</a></li>
</ol>

<li>Was up too late last night and did not do much good for myself (porn), but
I on the productive side I read some of MJG&rsquo;s new book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rots-War-Ignifer-Cycle-Book-ebook/dp/B07BCDRQDF">The Rot&rsquo;s War</a>
Ignifer Cycle Book 2</li>
<li>co-gender circle seems to have come back to meeting after a
significant dip in attendance over winter holidays</li>
<li>men&rsquo;s circle has had pretty solid attendance, often with 7 men.  I
might start tracking the <em>numbers</em> of attendees to see if there are
any useful patterns</li>
</ol>

<p>13:41 Saturday 02 June 2018 JST</p>

<ol>
<li>today I got a good start on the outer spiral for the large and
medium marbles for Marble Track 3</li>

<ol>
<li>Still have my MacBook Pro, like 4 or 5 years old now</li>
<li>Lin and I have lived in our house for 2 years yay</li>
<li>Jennie is good and has a cat door so she can come in and go out on
her own schedule</li>
<li>I have been talking to Kristen via Marco Polo recently</li>
<li>I have not been talking to Richard via Marco Polo recently.</li>
<li>Just met T from AB to figure out the next priorities for the
site.  Good meeting, and good to meet with them regularly.</li>
<li>I applied to &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; a symphony orchestra for some event at Muza
on July 1st.  Will find out around 15 June if I got it.</li>
<li>Still have not made any more LINE stickers beyond the first two I
made for Jennie, including &ldquo;Jennie says what&rdquo; which is no longer
for sale (Lin did not like one of the pictures) and &ldquo;Jennie says
yeah&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maybe I will make &ldquo;Jennie says Tomoko&rdquo; and have the name Tomoko
written in various ways around Jennie posed in various ways.</li>
<li>Monday noon lessons at U in Nishi-Azabu are getting better; I seem
to have found a good groove with the students.</li>
<li>dev on ConSwi for Godot has stalled in past couple of weeks. ugh.</li>
<li>Co-gender group meets on Mondays and men&rsquo;s circle meets on
Tuesdays (since early 2018)</li>
<li>I have been studying on Thursday nights with Mel in Chicago for a while.</li>
<li>I have been teaching on Sunday nights with Sarumama near Shinjuku
for a much longer while.</li>
<li>Last week I had a meeting with Michael in UK to talk about ways to create a
program for corporate team building.</li>
<li>Been going to SOGO each Sunday, and Lin&rsquo;s friend Aki has started
to come as well.  She has attended twice in past two weeks and
seems keen to continue.</li>
<li>She asked Junyu how to get more physically fit; he talked for 15
or so minutes in Japanese and I understood 80 or 90 percent.</li>
<li>I could probably say 5% or 10%</li>
<li>I have been using my waterproof Aquos phone for a while..  maybe 2
years</li>
<li>M$ is going to buy Github, which is good for the Github peeps I
guess, but likely bad for open source.  I will move my junk off to
something else.  Maybe.  Fred recently installed Gitlab on one of
his servers.  Maybe I can use it.</li>
<li>Each Monday I have been chilling in Saizeria between Nishi-Azabu
lesson and co-gender circle.  Time to head to co-gender circle soon.</li>
