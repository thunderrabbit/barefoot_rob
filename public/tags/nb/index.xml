Worked at NB on Tuesday, my first lesson there that only lasted 1 hour. Boo. It was okay going all the way there for 2 hours, but just for 1 hour kinda sucks. I hope we can work out something else, like maybe they buy lunch as well.</description>

      <description>17:52 Tuesday 18 July 2017 JST Met new students for a first lesson in Nihonbashi. Five beginner students who all seem pretty genki. Some are more beginner than others.
JB was there to do the introduction and everything went smoothly. See you guys again next week! &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m glad to hear that!&amp;rdquo;</description>
