Ma and I chatted while waiting for Nico to arrive and clear customs. Fun chatting with her and nearly finished solving the latest NYT crossword puzzle. I can see how it would be a good way to keep the ol&amp;rsquo; left brain sharp.
I chatted with the nice driver of the shuttle bus as she drove us to the IAH parking lot a couple miles away from the airport.</description>

      <description>11:02 Sunday 22 January 2017 JST Last weekend I put shelves together in my room, and today I&amp;rsquo;m clearing off my glass desk (old computer desk), soon to be my new marble track desk.
 
13:05 Moved my desk to make it the way I wanted in the first place.
   
15:52 Sunday 22 January 2017 JST And now we finished moving my computer desk and even unpacking the last two boxes I hadn&amp;rsquo;t unpacked since moving here in June 2016.</description>

      <description>14:40 Monday 02 January 2017 JST I think December 30th is the date Lin and I went to Nittori and ordered some shelves for my room. They are almost exactly what I would have designed and built for myself, given time and materials.</description>
