      <description>Mark synchronistically got on the same train car as me and we had a great quick check-in. I was able to dump everything about work and computer things going unexpectedly, and he told me about a cool set of questions he found that may work well in our men&amp;rsquo;s circle.
We did not have long to hang out so just quick stories and then long wave bye as we had to go on separate trains in 代々木上原 station.</description>

      <description>06:11 Monday 12 November 2018 JST Mark rode 4km from the 古民家公園 to our house yesterday to meet Lin and see Marble Track 3 in person. He had some great ideas for MT3:
 Encourage teambuilding among youth by giving them a certain set of track pieces, tools, and time limit to make a track that fits a certain set of requirements. Set my camera so the whole set is in focus.</description>
