      <description>1 October 1997
 Today I felt moved to consult my Runes about my travel plans, and how I am so excited and want to travel now! 
I did a 3 Rune spread. The first Rune (reading from right to left) describes the &amp;ldquo;overview of the situation;&amp;rdquo; the second Rune (center) identifies the &amp;ldquo;challenge;&amp;rdquo; and the third Rune (left) indicates the &amp;ldquo;course of action called for&amp;rdquo;
