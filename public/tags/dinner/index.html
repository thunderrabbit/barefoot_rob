<p>Though I thought things would be winding down here this evening, the
table is being set and everyone is having fun.</p>

<p>Dinner was delicious, especially the dessert consisting of condensed
milk, coconut milk, and prunes as topping.</p>

<p>I am falling asleep here, but I wanted to attend I-group.  I think
most men have checked out.</p>

<p>Hung out with Kai and Mika near Mika&rsquo;s work tonight.  They gave me a
stack of flyers to hand out for a show that Mika and Kai will be
staffing on Monday.  Thanks to Mika for sending my medium rare burger
back to be recooked to well done as I had ordered!  Thanks to Mama for
snacks she brought back today from her trip.</p>

<p>Mika had to head back to work so Kai and I walked her there and then
walked to Tokyo station by way of her English speaking dentist.  We
met a man in the station who is apparently an 江戸子(sp), and talked
about how his ggggrandfather was a samurai.</p>

<p><a href="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2017/funny_guy.jpg"><img src="//b.robnugen.com/journal/2017/thumbs/funny_guy.jpg" alt="funny guy" /></a></p>

<p>Kai and I took the second oldest subway in Tokyo to the busiest train
station in Japan (the world?) and I jumped into a picture with some
guys who were posing next to a sign featuring Snoopy and large text
&ldquo;Pose here&rdquo; or something.  Then the timing worked out that Lin arrived
just after me so we took the same train back to our station!</p>

<p>A-san-su treated us to dinner after we went to Machida with him and
a-san-su-mei.  Lin wanted to drive, which I didn&rsquo;t mind until we got
close to the station and tried to park.  Man we coulda saved a lot of
time by taking the train.</p>

<p>Anyway, they found no souvenirs in Machida area, but got some near our
station.  The we ate at our favorite buffet restaurant and talked
about eating less, esp at night, and eating better, esp in the
morning.  We shall see.</p>

<p>Great to have a-san-su and a-san-su-mei staying with us for a couple
of days!  I met them around the time Lin and I got married, so it&rsquo;s
been a few years since we&rsquo;ve seen them!  Lin&rsquo;s sisters and kids came
over last night for big dinner and lots of laughter.  Middle sister
and I did cheers a couple times with red wine and limone,
respectively.  I tried to find an ordering around the table that would
have a smooth transition between languages spoken.  Couldn&rsquo;t solve it
even with just 3 languages involved.</p>

<p>The kids played with the French vertical labyrinth kinda game, and did
pretty well.  The youngest was the most willing to play.  Middle kid
just watched TV and the oldest focused on social media via cellphone.
We all focused on brownies and ice cream at the end of the evening.
So decadent!</p>

<p>Sisters and kids left around 10pm and then we pretty much headed to
sleep.</p>

<p>This morning I showed aunt and uncle Marble Track 3 so far (finished
first four clips (5 minutes 28 seconds (~3936 frames)))</p>

<p>Now headed to TY.</p>

<p>Lin and I went to Paola&rsquo;s for dinner with some cool peeps including
Jas, Rob, Rio, Ryo, and Tomoko.  Ryo and Tomoko brought their rabbit,
Nana; Rio brought a box of tissues.  Rob works with Jon who had to
work a bit during the evening.</p>

<p>Food, of course, was amazing, and I tried amaretto for the first
time.  Pretty yummy!</p>

<p>Lin&rsquo;s mom made about 6 different Taiwanese dishes for a dinner party
featuring Jas, Jon, Paola, Lin, and me.  Great delicious, though a
couple were a bit spicy for me.</p>

<p>So funny as Jon and Jas got progressively sillier and sillier as they
poured a bottle of shochu(?) for everyone.</p>

<p>It was hard to keep Mama seated long enough to eat much; even Lin is
eating now as I type this after we walked everyone to the station.</p>

<p>On the way there I asked Jon if he knew of anyone he&rsquo;d recommend for
personal investment advice.  Noop.</p>

<p>We stopped by Kaldi and got some chocolate (and the boys got more
beverages)</p>

<p>I took us through Azalea because it&rsquo;s warmer and we stopped by a large
array of products from Kagoshima where Jas offered everyone white
chocolate.</p>

<p>Hugged them off at the ticket gates and Lin and I walked home where
we&rsquo;re now watching &ldquo;Olympus Has Fallen&rdquo; which doesn&rsquo;t seem very
realistic.</p>

<p>##22:21</p>

<p>Holy cats Jas gave us a huge tin of delicious cookies!!!!</p>
