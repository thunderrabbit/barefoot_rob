<p>On my way to SOGO there was a blue car amongst the stalls where people
were selling bread and beads and stuff.  Huh.  Old car looks new.  It
was old, and I asked the guy how old it was.  Older than me by 2 years.</p>

<p>After SOGO I talked to him (in English) for about 20 minutes, and met
his daughter, who has an accupuncture place nearby.  Neat!  Might go
sometime.</p>

<p>Now I've gotten my finances up to date.  Have paid off the balance
on fixing Scott just before I left for SWUUSI way back in July.  Have
paid my credit card off (mostly gas purchases, but also for my website
hosting for the next 13 months) and all is lovely.</p>

<p>Going to put new spark plugs on Scott now.</p>

<p>I got these new crazy spark plugs with <a href="https://www.boschautoparts.com/en/auto/spark-plugs/platinum-4-spark-plugs"> four (4) electrode
things to spark.</a>  Wow.</p>

<p><ul>
<li>
This weekend I purchased a car.  I bought a 1990 Toyota Camry, 5 speed manual transmission, 94242 miles, beautifully clean silver exterior and grey velure interior.
<p>
Wende and I had just looked again at the first Camry I looked at.  I was all, &ldquo;welll ..  maybe I&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo;  Wende suggested that we go see what was available at the Toyota dealership we happened to be passing.
<p>
It was 9pm when we walked in. I told Stan I wanted a 1989 or 90 Camry and he went to check.  They had just received one that day at 4pm. Nice.<br>
We went to see the car, and Stan said their mechanics had not looked at it yet and he had no idea what to expect.  We found the car to be immaculately clean and Wende hopped in the driver&rsquo;s seat.  She couldn&rsquo;t start it.  &ldquo;Push the clutch all the way in,&rdquo; we suggested. Nothing. Stan tried and it started no problem.  Hmmm.
<p>
So I drove us around and we found that the left turn signal didn&rsquo;t work quite properly, and the right front tire was out of balance.  Other than that the car&rsquo;s cool. <font size=-2>( - Jules in <em>Pulp Fiction</em>)</font>
<p>
We got back to the lot and I announced firmly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it!&rdquo; because my inner me said YES for sure. (Other cool things: there is an &ldquo;evolve&rdquo; fish with legs on the back, and a blood donor sticker on one window, and umbrella &amp; windshield shade in the back seat)
<p>
Stan quoted $5000 plus or minus $300 depending on what the mechanics find.
<p>
(I&rsquo;ll keep the story short)
<p>
The next day, I signed papers for $5300 + TT&amp;L for the car.  They had to replace the clutch, and the A/C compressor.  The wheels were still out of balance so the next day I got two new front tires and they fixed the left turn signal. Bonus. Partytime.  I am <em>happy</em>!
<p>
I named the car Scott.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Last night Scott and I went to my dad&rsquo;s house for Christmas celebration with my brother Fred. No tree, no muss, no fuss, just hugs and love and a few gifts.  Fred and I had the most fun with a set of colored blocks that are a gift for Noah, our first cousin once removed.
</li>
<p>
<li>
This morning, my dad and I went grocery shopping. I enjoyed spending the time talking with him.
</li>
<p>
<li>
On the way home today, Scott and I witnessed an accident. I parked Scott and hopped out to take notes. A Blazer had smashed into a pickup truck that hadn&rsquo;t yet moved at a green light, and another pickup truck slightly smashed into the Blazer.
<p>
The cops arrived fairly quickly and I gave them my version of the story and my phone number and stuff.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Now I&rsquo;m at work watching to make sure the computers stay happy.
<p>
When I leave in a couple hours, it will be straight to my mom&rsquo;s house in College Station, 1.5 hours away.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Happy Winter Solstice.<br>
