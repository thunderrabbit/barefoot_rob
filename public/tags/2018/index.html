Toshie&rsquo;s last lesson so we had a party in her honor with all her
favorite snack foods.</p>

<ul>
<li>Marble Track 3 has its own domain, <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">https://www.marbletrack3.com/</a>
hosted as a static site on Netlify</li>
<li>ConSwi is open source under GNU copyleft.  Several outstanding issues,
the biggest of which are
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/25">#25 disallow dragged pieces to go through other pieces</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/conswi/issues/23">#23 Make piece keep up with mouse when dragging</a></li>
<li>I created a
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/marbletrack3">Patreon page for MT3</a> and
have my first patron, Jimmy!</li>
<li>I recently got the fans and battery replaced on my MacBook, but it
still conks out when the battery is at 65%.  I let it run all the
way down to 0 after charging all the way, and did cmd-shift-p-r on
boot.</li>
<li>I have not been writing journal entries very consistently recently</li>
<li>Working on AB, trying to get the code base for both sites up to
snuff with MLAPHP</li>
<li>Working on TY, trying to get the new students up to speed</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 has six (6) different supports for the outer spiral,
and they each have webpages on the website, with shortlinks so I can
refer to them easily enough <a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/1poss">https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/1poss</a> -
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/6poss">https://www.marbletrack3.com/p/6poss</a>  The /p/ stands for &ldquo;parts&rdquo; as
in &ldquo;parts of the track&rdquo; and Nposs stands for the Nth Placed Outer
Spiral Support.</li>
<li>C and E have their wedding party soon (this coming Thursday)</li>
<li>Lin and I had a date tonight, eating ramen at a local cheap ramen
shop.  They deal with money by having a vending machine that
dispenses colored plastic cards which tell what we ordered.  The
cards are as thick as poker chips, but round-rectangular</li>
<li>Jennie is our cat.  She goes in and out through her cat door on the
2nd floor, which leads to the balcony and her little cat stair-bench
to the roof, to the tree, to the ground (and back).</li>
<li>The Marble Track 3 site is on version 2 now, which focuses on the
characters making the site instead of on me making the site.  I
think it is more interesting this way, but it still needs a tweak
before I am like &ldquo;yep&rdquo;.  The top page isn&rsquo;t right yet..  Currently
shows my inspiration for starting the project, but should show
<em>their</em> inspiration (or something), but I do not yet know what that
is.</li>
<li>Lucifer is in its 3rd season, so I have started watching it on Netflix, so far
not bingeing.</li>
<li>I plan to binge the hell out of Rick and Morty seasons 3 - 99 when
they are available.</li>
<li>My primary non-static web provider said my wiki dedicated to Castle
of Dreams was using too much memory.  I need to convert it to a
static site and let people edit it via git.  Fack when will I ever
make time for that?</li>
<li>Been talking to Dora about getting business started.  She introduced
me to <a href="https://www.danpena.co.uk/">Dan Pe√±a&rsquo;s site</a> and it&rsquo;s like damn.</li>
<li>Speaking of castles, how is it that we live like royalty did back in the
day, but compared to back in the day, we still are like slaves?</li>
<li></li>

<li>Dreamhost has decided to stop supporting catch-all emails so I am
looking for a new provider.  The encrypted versions cannot search
nor test for spam very well so I may not be happy with any of those</li>
<li>I am too tired to write this right now so I should go to bed.</li>
<li>For AB, I have started adding arc_cycles, which should save them a
decent amount of time when creating historical reports.</li>

<li>I checked out <a href="https://dayboard.co/">https://dayboard.co/</a> for a couple days, but it has some bugs so am going to skip it for now.</li>

<li>Was up too late last night and did not do much good for myself (porn), but
I on the productive side I read some of MJG&rsquo;s new book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rots-War-Ignifer-Cycle-Book-ebook/dp/B07BCDRQDF">The Rot&rsquo;s War</a>
Ignifer Cycle Book 2</li>
<li>co-gender circle seems to have come back to meeting after a
significant dip in attendance over winter holidays</li>
<li>men&rsquo;s circle has had pretty solid attendance, often with 7 men.  I
might start tracking the <em>numbers</em> of attendees to see if there are
any useful patterns</li>

<li>Still have my MacBook Pro, like 4 or 5 years old now</li>
<li>Lin and I have lived in our house for 2 years yay</li>
<li>Jennie is good and has a cat door so she can come in and go out on
her own schedule</li>
<li>I have been talking to Kristen via Marco Polo recently</li>
<li>I have not been talking to Richard via Marco Polo recently.</li>
<li>Just met T from AB to figure out the next priorities for the
site.  Good meeting, and good to meet with them regularly.</li>
<li>I applied to &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; a symphony orchestra for some event at Muza
on July 1st.  Will find out around 15 June if I got it.</li>
<li>Still have not made any more LINE stickers beyond the first two I
made for Jennie, including &ldquo;Jennie says what&rdquo; which is no longer
for sale (Lin did not like one of the pictures) and &ldquo;Jennie says
yeah&rdquo;</li>
<li>Maybe I will make &ldquo;Jennie says Tomoko&rdquo; and have the name Tomoko
written in various ways around Jennie posed in various ways.</li>
<li>Monday noon lessons at U in Nishi-Azabu are getting better; I seem
to have found a good groove with the students.</li>
<li>dev on ConSwi for Godot has stalled in past couple of weeks. ugh.</li>
<li>Co-gender group meets on Mondays and men&rsquo;s circle meets on
Tuesdays (since early 2018)</li>
<li>I have been studying on Thursday nights with Mel in Chicago for a while.</li>
<li>I have been teaching on Sunday nights with Sarumama near Shinjuku
for a much longer while.</li>
<li>Last week I had a meeting with Michael in UK to talk about ways to create a
program for corporate team building.</li>
<li>Been going to SOGO each Sunday, and Lin&rsquo;s friend Aki has started
to come as well.  She has attended twice in past two weeks and
seems keen to continue.</li>
<li>She asked Junyu how to get more physically fit; he talked for 15
or so minutes in Japanese and I understood 80 or 90 percent.</li>
<li>I could probably say 5% or 10%</li>
<li>I have been using my waterproof Aquos phone for a while..  maybe 2
years</li>
<li>M$ is going to buy Github, which is good for the Github peeps I
guess, but likely bad for open source.  I will move my junk off to
something else.  Maybe.  Fred recently installed Gitlab on one of
his servers.  Maybe I can use it.</li>
<li>Each Monday I have been chilling in Saizeria between Nishi-Azabu
lesson and co-gender circle.  Time to head to co-gender circle soon.</li>

<p>It snowed &ldquo;today&rdquo; and was 2 degrees C all day long.  It&rsquo;s apparently
going up to 16 or 18 degrees C tomorrow.</p>

<p>I chatted with Delayna who I&rsquo;ve known since our mutual YRUU days back
in late 1980s, culminating with

<p>I am on the train and the above is as far as I got before
sidetracking myself with something before having a meeting with TY at
9am then lunch with Lin.</p>

<p>Today:</p>

<ul>
<li>I got my AWS account switched to JPY instead of USD so I can pay
more efficiently.</li>
<li>I said Sorry to Alan of ngrok for letting my account lapse; he
replied immediately after pausing it for me.</li>
<li>Lin and I walked to the train station.  Weather is cold and windy
but features a clear blue sky.</li>
<li>Chatting with Michael a bit; I will meet him on Friday after work.</li>
<li>I forgot to bring</li>
<li>I thought of a reasonable crypto currency to make: Curios, which
will have the feature of being valueless so people who are curious
about cryptocurrencies can get into them without worries.  We will
just give away 10,000 coins to anyone who wants them and just let
people play around with them.</li>
<li>Mel emailed me and I emailed her back</li>

<p>Today is the last day of winter holiday for me.  Lin and I have been
back home for a week, during which I have mostly worked on Godot, read
<em>The Power of Now</em>, watched movies with Lin, and worked a bit on MT3.</p>

<p>This past Saturday, we went to see her family for Happy New Year, and
I have been chatting with her niece in English on LINE since then.</p>

<p>We watched The Last Jedi (Star Wars episode 8) last night in the
theater (Lin slept a little) and then The Phantom Menace (episode 1)
at home via Amazon (199 yen rental for 48 hours) (I slept a little and
Lin slept a lot).</p>

<p>Oh, and this is the time that Meltdown and Spectre are making the
news.  Intel stock is down a bit, but probably not for long.</p>
