      <description>SWUUSI
4pm Tuesday 28 July 1998
transcribed from my diary Missed Spirit Circle tody and I certainly didn&#39;t want to do that; I had wanted to compliment the youth on how well they are drinking plenty of water and to keep it up. I did make breakfast though, and then Drake Baer (theme speaker) workshop, during which I wrote a mythical story about how The Feel Good Net got started. Morning workshops and then I went swimming from 1:25pm to essentially now.</description>
