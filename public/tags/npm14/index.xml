      <description>16:09 Monday 15 December 2014 JST Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s not really a maze; there are no dead ends except for the start and finish points. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a puzzle to figure out how to connect the start and end points.
Anyway, After about 4 hours of work, I&amp;rsquo;ve finished the final draft:

Now I just need to draw all the black lines on the actual panels.

Over the weekend I worked on expanding the four pieces to a larger project. At this point it looks like this:

I haven&amp;rsquo;t got the maze planned exactly, but I want to draw a maze that spans the panels. The points at which the maze goes off the edge of panels will be aligned in a way that the panels seem to fit together in multiple ways.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to call them; they&amp;rsquo;re not really drawings, nor are they paintings.. They&amp;rsquo;ll eventually be pieces of a maze puzzle thing.
I&amp;rsquo;ll draw a maze or two behind them; I drew some dots on the edges where the maze paths would cross over the different panels, but I made a mistake that will require drawing some more pieces. Maybe it was intentional so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have 4 pieces as a set, because four is unlucky in Japan.</description>
