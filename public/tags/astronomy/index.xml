 Virgin Galactic Preps for Liftoff at World&amp;rsquo;s First Commercial Spaceport
Tight. I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed reading articles about astronomy and wanted to be an astro-physicist (actually just wanted my name in Discover Magazine)&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m glad that soon we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to fly so high&amp;hellip;</description>

 We should explore the possibility of generating electric power through single cycle fusion process using Helium-3 on the moon,&amp;rdquo; Kalam said.The former president, who led India&amp;rsquo;s successful missile programme, said energy production through fossil fuel generates 30 billion tonnes of CO2 annually and countries should look for cleaner energy.

Wow wow wow. Quite amazing to see this orbit so elliptical and dwarfing pluto&amp;rsquo;s orbit..</description>

 How We&amp;rsquo;ll Get Back to the Moon
 NASA - How We&amp;rsquo;ll Get Back to the Moon
This looks pretty cool. I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued by the cargo and crew launching separately, but I guess it makes sense to keep the crew away from the heavier launch thing. It will be interesting to see how they will handle disruptions in launching the second vehicle. If the first one is in orbit and then the second can&amp;rsquo;t be launched, how long can the first one stay in orbit to wait?</description>

CERN Courier - General relativity versus Newtonian phsyics
No more need for pesky undetectable dark matter!
What I can&amp;rsquo;t understand is why they used Newtonian physics to confirm Einstein&amp;rsquo;s theories!
My brother explained thusly:
 I actually have no idea about this dark matter stuff, and don&amp;rsquo;t know much about relativity and quantum physics, but I can mention two things:
 1, Newtonian physics isn&amp;rsquo;t actually wrong in relativistic conditions.</description>

Unveiling the high energy Milky Way reveals &amp;lsquo;dark accelerators&amp;rsquo;
In general, this article tells me we know nothing about the universe.
Even so, I like how they&amp;rsquo;re using the atmosphere to detect the gamma rays via Cherenkov light. wow.</description>
