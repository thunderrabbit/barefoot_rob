Hanako and Christy are over from Austin at Hanako&amp;rsquo;s parents, who happen to be our neighbors across the street. Mom came over at 9pm or so and was like, &amp;ldquo;Rob! come over!&amp;rdquo;
After hugging Hanako and Christy I talked to them and ignored Hanako&amp;rsquo;s siblings who were there with family because I was in new-people-overload (doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much, I guess) and selfishly wanted to talk to Americans.</description>
