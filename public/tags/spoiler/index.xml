      <description>23:54 Friday 20 October 2017 JST The human story was fine but the science included a lot of &amp;hellip; fiction. I saw the ending coming a mile away even though at the very end I second guessed my correct original guess. Holy cats they threw away a lot of equipment to kill one little monster. Why would that couple hook up after having apparently been so focused on their just deceased partners?</description>

Monument Valley features fun puzzles and the most unique+elegant+beautiful gameplay I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in an app since that one game where we bounce around bubbles or something.
(I&amp;rsquo;d try to find a link, but I have no internet access now.)
Anyway, I think Monument Valley is worth $3.99 for any puzzle enthusiast.</description>
