      <description>00:51 Saturday 22 September 2018 JST Saw Miyu briefly tonight at Apocrypha #17, a trip to remember. Met Sabrina who I thought was courageous for the story she told about her family. This was Isaac&amp;rsquo;s second event, and it went really well. Yumi told a story about a transformative experience she had, which sounded to me like it could be a mixed gender version of Mankind Project. Chelsea&amp;rsquo;s story also seemed courageous, regarding personal struggles while on vacation.</description>
