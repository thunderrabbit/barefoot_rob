      <description>This morning during meditation I realized I can do Meetups anywhere in the world. Why limit myself to just Tokyo?
Why not lead an eye gazing workshop in Hawaii while I&amp;rsquo;m there?
I am going to go for a walk; I wonder what time the local store opens. Probably 7am.</description>

      <description>07:46 Friday 07 September 2018 JST Walked this morning for the first time in a week or so oops. Good times, including meeting the guy who I usually meet on Wednesdays while he is on his exercise route. Oh, and nodded to the kid who runs around the neighborhood as well.</description>

      <description>16:40 Saturday 30 December 2017 -02 We are going to get on the flight in several hours from now. I wonder when I will start to reverse my sleep schedule. We are 11 hours behind Tokyo, so not as far away as possible, but close.
I have just gotten out my computer (to work on ConSwi) when I realized I should be sleeping.</description>

      <description>07:38 Monday 05 June 2017 JST I feel a bit tired this morning, and am not too sure how I will present today&amp;rsquo;s material; it depends on how long the discussion of &amp;ldquo;What does it mean to be Japanese&amp;rdquo; goes.
07:51 Monday 05 June 2017 JST Egad I am falling asleep.
Also, I just remembered this morning that I still have to test t.CB and m.CB and api.CB before making the new CB server handle live traffic.</description>

      <description>07:50 Tuesday 09 June 2015 JST Funny how I&amp;rsquo;ve not worked on my journal infrastructure for a while. Lin just today asked why it takes me so lonngg to put the stuff back on my desk. I told her it&amp;rsquo;s cause I&amp;rsquo;m careful, but it&amp;rsquo;s also cause I&amp;rsquo;m lazy / busy with other junk.
In the case of my website, it&amp;rsquo;s only because I&amp;rsquo;m busy with other junk.
Yesterday I reinjured my elbow picking up Lin&amp;rsquo;s bicycle to carry over the train tracks on the way to meet Masa at noon in Lazona.</description>
