      <description>20:49 Saturday 08 August 2015 JST Satomi said her friend Kenji liked to climb trees so we should all do so! Today was the day; we met in Yoyogi Park at 4pm. At first it was Satomi and Zakky, and then I showed up and we went into Yoyogi. Kenji and his wife Sherry (sp) came as well, and their friend Ozan lives nearby so joined the fun. He said he wasn&amp;rsquo;t good at climbing trees, but we had fun playing badmitton and throwing a hard tennis ball at velcro mitts.</description>
