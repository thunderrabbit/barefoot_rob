      <description>SWUUSI
12:13pm Friday 31 July 1998
transcribed from my diary Welp, we&#39;re on the way back home from SWUUSI. I was kinda in a grouchy mood when I woke up this morning after missing the talent show last night. Fricke et.al. had written a song for SWUUSI and fuck I missed it and they are graduating. But I felt way better with all the love and hugs and happy happy joy joy throughout the camp, and signing mugbooks and taking pictures and all the fun.</description>
