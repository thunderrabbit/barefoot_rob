      <description>15:17 Thursday 28 January 2016 CST Was fun but definitely not as life changing as I kinda guessed. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll be an addict, but I may go again.
We went twice today. Got it on video the first time; the videographers interviewed us at various points and we were all like rar and stuff, plus Francois is there in the non-flight scenes.
We decided to jump again ($99) and I realized having the camera guys there was kinda じゃま because the second time we just went up and jumped.</description>
