      <description>20:51 Sunday 06 November 2016 JST Today I worked out in the park with a group who call themselves Suns Out Guns Out https://www.facebook.com/groups/sogotko and I can see my endurance and strength have increased since I joined them a couple months ago.
I found out a few days ago that my 7 minute presentation is ON for November 24th; https://www.pechakucha.org/cities/tokyo/events/581bfccc9831a6196b000002 I&amp;rsquo;m putting it together and pulling myself together to make it the best I can.</description>
