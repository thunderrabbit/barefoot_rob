      <description>01:48 Wednesday 30 August 2017 JST The past few entries are dated some hours after they happened, but this one is being written in real time. I gotta wake up in 3 hours. shit shit shit.
Fortunately, I can sleep for a bit on the train. Unfortunately, I can only sleep for 50 minutes on the train and it usually leaves me groggy.</description>

      <description>19:06 Wednesday 18 November 2015 JST I believe you’ve said they should not be able create inquiries to filter the items (and put them on MyList), so at this point I’m planning to remove the filter tab for these users. Oh wait! I can’t remove that list for them, because people who are not logged in already have it. It says “log in to add items to MyList”.. so I think we have to retain this ability for these users.</description>
