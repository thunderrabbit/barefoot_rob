      <description>15:34 Monday 05 March 2018 JST To pursue his dream of travel, Rob gave up his comfortable life in Texas, including house, car, cat, and fiance. Just to see what else is out there. Fascinated with time, Rob has started a stop-motion animation project, likely to take ten years. He has also started writing a novel, which is being presented backwards, one word at a time. Walking around barefoot as often as possible, Rob hopes to inspire others to do what they like, regardless of what other people may think.</description>

      <description>18:56 Saturday 19 August 2017 JST I am using my phone to give my PC access to the web, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t working, so I&amp;rsquo;ll save this email here.
Hi Alex This URL describes the directory structure that I would like to backup. https://helpwiki.evergreen.edu/wiki/index.php/Folder_Structure_-_Dragonframe I am currently using rsync over ssh to save it to my server, but I am open to having it backed up to mutlple places. I guess uploadcare uses its own filenames for each file that is uploaded.</description>
