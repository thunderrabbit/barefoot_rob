Ma came to the baggage claim area to wait for me! We took the subway (subterrainian electric vehicle that ran on rails that looked relatively light) to the hotel and got some food there. I marveled at the size of the portions, but there was no in-flight meal so I finished what we ordered.
The veggie burger tasted somewhat like raw meat. Not sure if I would have enjoyed it if I thought it was real meat.</description>
