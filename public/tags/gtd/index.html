<p>I wrote this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using Complice for a while and I am at a stage where I am reminded to do a few things that I might not have remembered, but I am not excited to craft my things to do.</p>

<p>I think part of the problem is I have a bunch of stuff coming in from Workflowy, which includes little reminders (wear a belt, which I sometimes forget) and (do not eat after 9pm, which I sometimes ignore)</p>

<p>I am just blathering, but if this is a thing that people go through (and has an article written, I would not mind being pointed to it, or) you can just nod and listen</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://complice.co/about-the-team">Malcom</a> from <a href="https://complice.co/?r=pgej30cphu">Complice</a> wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a thing that probably warrants an article being written about
it! It took me awhile to get to this, but I have now written TWO
articles! One is published, and the other one (which is a more direct
reply to you) is not yet. But here it is:</p>

<p>This is a natural cycle. What you&rsquo;re encountering is a form of
staleness. Complice is in general designed to combat staleness, for
instance by not allowing you to enter a bunch of tasks that you&rsquo;re not
actually going to do today. However, staleness can still show up in a
few ways. The dailies and notdones features were ones that I knew
would introduce sources of staleness into the system, so I did my best
to counter-optimize for that. I think I did a reasonably good job, but
it&rsquo;s not perfect yet.</p>

<p>The WorkFlowy integration&hellip; needs major work. Having established that, there are two levels to it:</p>

<ol>
<li>What can you do differently? (since you&rsquo;re asking)</li>
<li>What can Complice do differently? (since most Complice users won&rsquo;t read this article)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What can you do differently?</strong></p>

<p>It sounds to me like you want to fix your belt problem using
something other than a reminder in your task list. I wrote an article
called
<a href="https://blog.complice.co/post/111442313267/how-to-send-perfectly-timed-physical-messages-to">How to send perfectly-timed physical messages to your future self</a>
which would advocate for a strategy something like &ldquo;when you take your
belt off, put it on top of something that you&rsquo;ll pick up tomorrow
after you have your pants on&rdquo; and then obviously when you go to pick
up that something, you&rsquo;ll first need to pick up your belt, at which
point you put your belt on.</p>

<p>This is a specific example, but the general principle is that doing
your desired behavior automatically is better than doing it by
reminder. And if you do have to use a reminder, the best kind is one
that leaves no ambiguity about whether or not now is the moment. So
for &ldquo;do not eat after 9pm&rdquo;, maybe what you want is something that will
make your phone buzz once at 8:30pm, to remind you that it&rsquo;s your last
chance to eat today, and something to make your phone buzz at 9pm,
indicating that eating is now over for the day.</p>

<p>Another even-more-general principle is: <strong>if something isn&rsquo;t working,
stop doing it</strong>. If the Complice &ldquo;do not eat after 9pm&rdquo; intention
isn&rsquo;t reminding you to stop eating after 9pm, then find something
else. You might still keep the intention around if you want to <em>track</em>
which days you were successful at this, but it&rsquo;s clearly failing as a
reminder.</p>

<p><strong>Triaging staleness</strong></p>

<p>While writing this post, I ended up writing so much under dealing
with staleness that I decided to make it its own post:
<a href="https://blog.complice.co/post/173836925777/making-sense-of-a-single-stale-task">Making sense of a single stale task</a>
The basic gist is that it could be because the thing actually doesn&rsquo;t
matter, or it could be because you&rsquo;re conflicted about it. If the
thing doesn&rsquo;t matter, don&rsquo;t do it! If you&rsquo;re conflicted, either fix
the task until you&rsquo;re not conflicted, or find a way to get back in
touch with why the task matters so that rather than forcing yourself
to do it (and resisting being forced) you&rsquo;re naturally drawn to it
based on your sense of purpose.</p>

<p><strong>What can Complice do differently?</strong></p>

<p>Well, one thing would be if Complice could detect when people might be
in situations like yours, and encourage them to reflect a bit like
this post is doing.</p>

<p>Another piece is that it&rsquo;s currently hard to stop stale WorkFlowy
things that are getting pulled into Complice, from within the Complice
UI. My workflow for this looks like &ldquo;copy the node id from my
intentions textbox, open up a WorkFlowy tab, replace the node id in
that tab with the one from my intentions, then delete/complete/untag
that node.&rdquo; Even though that only takes 10-20 seconds, it&rsquo;s still way
too cumbersome.</p>

<p>Regarding reflecting when things go stale, Complice could notice when
you have an intention N days in a row and it doesn&rsquo;t get done, and
prompt you to think about it a bit more. The notdone propagator
currently does this with one-off intentions, but there&rsquo;s still a major
issue here with repeating tasks either from the built-in dailies or
from WorkFlowy.</p>
