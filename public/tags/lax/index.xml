      <description>06:40 Tuesday 26 January 2016 PST Security theater required me to discard new, sealed, branded, small plastic drink containers because they were &amp;ldquo;more than 2.5 ounces.&amp;rdquo; I chugged them, spilling a bit of the second one on the floor in my petty, foolish, wasted, little act of defiance against Chertov and the warmongering punks who sell the idea that 9&amp;frasl;11 was perpetrated by people living in a cave.
I still got a bomb, three hatchets, sarin gas containers, a katana, a cactus, and a 44 Magnum through the security gate.</description>

      <description>12:12 Friday 22 January 2016 PST About 40 minutes before our flight, and I&amp;rsquo;m charging my computer a little bit away from our gate because I&amp;rsquo;m addicted to my computer (and therefore it having power) and don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can get a power fix closer to the gate.
In line at the deli kiosk thing where we grabbed some foodage, We saw the cabin attendant who gave me slippers.</description>
