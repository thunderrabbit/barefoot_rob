Had a great day yesterday at Yomiuriland with Bu and Yen. We pretty much rode everything, and I tried quite hard to ride without shoes on anything, but was pretty much requested to put on shoes every time. I think I made it onto one ride (a kiddy ride) without shoes. Oh and maybe the ferris wheel?
I did a little skit of Francois driving a gocart.</description>

      <description> 09:13 Saturday 13 April 2019 JST Excited to go to Yomiuriland with Lin and Mikarin today!
21:22 Saturday 13 April 2019 JST Just got back home, though we left Yomiuriland around 5pm. Pretty early from my point of view, but they were both tired.
Good times.

Bandit line
##10:58
nice!
##11:01
bicycles line
##11:05
fun! It&amp;rsquo;s actually got hills and brake sections so it&amp;rsquo;s arguably a coaster
##11:10
spinning ride where riders control the altitude on per car basis
##11:13
in line for scary house
##11:20
not so scary. No actors inside to scare (us), though Lin jumped a few times
##11:28
standing looping coaster configuration seems different than I remember from some years ago!</description>
