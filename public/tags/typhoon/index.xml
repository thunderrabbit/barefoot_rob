      <description>(written 19:07 Wednesday 11 September 2019 JST)
We had a typhoon Sunday night / Monday morning. It was fine for us, but a doozy in some parts of our area. People died.
Trains stopped, trapping 13k people in Narita airport (Photo from Kyodo News).

Leaves blown everywhere.
 
Two high tenstion power towers collapsed.
And the one that amazes me most for its precision destruction, a net blew down from a golf driving range and sliced roofs of houses.</description>

      <description>11:39 Sunday 30 September 2018 JST SOGO was cancelled today due to a typhoon (that was also apparently cancelled).
I used the cancellation as an excuse not to go because I am supposed to attend a presentation right after SOGO and need to be clean for it.
Well, I do not need to be clean, but I imagine I will fit in better if my bare feet are not covered in mud.</description>

      <description>07:47 Friday 24 August 2018 JST This morning I walked during the typhoon that passed by Tokyo today. I saw some interesting effects of water rushing down the hill near よみうりランド前駅 I captured them on vertical video on Marco Polo to send to Lin, who stayed home.</description>

      <description>14:40 Monday 23 October 2017 JST When I took the train this morning at 6:24am, it was running on time no worries. However, apparently trains started running late soon thereafter. One of my students happens to live near my same station (新百合ヶ丘) and she said the trains were late, which caused her to arrive late. I am thankful for my policy of arriving 20+ minutes early.</description>

      <description>21:45 Sunday 22 October 2017 JST We are likely to have clear skies for most of tomorrow, but a typhoon is apparently coming tonight. It will be at its busiest around 2 or 3am. I look forward to seeing the river high but not flooding.</description>
