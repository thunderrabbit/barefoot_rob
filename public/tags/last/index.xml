      <description>06:12 Monday 20 November 2017 JST Just found out that Charlie died yesterday. Don&amp;rsquo;t have details (intentional / accidental). I called Dad, but immediately went to voice mail. I guess he is talking to them already.
20:55 Wednesday 29 November 2017 JST I misunderstood. It was Shane, not Charlie.</description>
