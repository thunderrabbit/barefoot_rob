      <description>18:28 Thursday 03 May 2018 JST This could be made into Taxi Turnaround Timelapse, but I do not have an easy way to do that and do not want to spend any more time on it.</description>

      <description>23:56 Monday 01 January 2018 JST We have arrived back in Haneda and are in a taxi back home. Didn&amp;rsquo;t realize trains would not be running very late so yay for 12000 yen for stale smoke flavored taxi.
Last train was at 11:51 and would require two transfers, including from KQ Kawasaki to JR Kawasaki station.
I get to work on MT3 tomorrow yayyy!</description>

      <description>18:55 Friday 15 December 2017 -03 Rodrigo got the days mixed up so was not at the airport to meet us as planned, but helped us by estimating the taxi price; it&amp;rsquo;s 75% of the cash we have handy, but we can make it!
21:22 Friday 15 December 2017 -02 Oh, São Paulo is actually an hour ahead of Fortaleza, so we are in -02.</description>
