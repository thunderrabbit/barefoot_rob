It had conventional fans to keep it aloft, but it was still intersting and a guy climbed onto it to see how it worked. he shone his flashlight inside and saw chsts of drawers whcih surprised us, but then he got off and we let it go, but unfortunately some kids had climbed onto it and they fel one by one.</description>
