<p>Today there were only 1.5 students in my Akihabara class.  This number
is down from our high of like 8 last year when I had to stop checking
homework during the lesson because there ended up being no time for
class.  I guess there would be time with just 2 students&rsquo; worth of
homework.</p>

<p>Anyway, the lesson kinda devolved into a China vs Japan debate.  I
should have nipped it, but I was too tired and I kinda thought the
students would sort it out.</p>

<p>I had some time before the lesson in Akihabara and ended up buying
some squishy toys that were even cooler than the one I bought late
last year.  These have balls inside them about the size of frog eggs,
and the outer balls stretch about as much as a frog&rsquo;s lower mouth.
The inner balls squirt out between fingers and make an awfully squirty
sound that is somewhat between stepping in mud and a cartoon splat.</p>

<p>Best lesson in a long time.</p>

<p>Atsuko read that the pandaball would expand if placed in water.  We
tried it, but it turned out that the balls <em>inside</em> the pandaball
would expand if placed in water.  We tried that instead, and they did
not grow as much as I hoped.</p>

<p>We then removed the rest of the balls so we could count them (Mayumi&rsquo;s
idea).  I guessed there would be 200.  Mayumi guessed 150.  Zumi
guessed 100.  Atsuko guessed 80.</p>

<p>It turned out there were 117 balls inside; Zumi won!  She also was
closest regarding the question &ldquo;guess how big they will get?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mayumi brought chocorooms and chokoboos (I just made that name up) but
I chose not to eat the packs she gave me because I have been fasting
today since 2pm.  Yeah I know it is not long, but by tomorrow morning
it will be longer than I usually wait..</p>

<p>After working 3 hours (5 lessons) near Lazona, I&rsquo;m eating cold lunch
in Akihabara across the street from GG lesson. I have Lin&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s
heavy-as-hell suitcase.  (Now I know why gorillas cannot break them)</p>

<p>Lesson was great; everyone was there!  Yoko, Maki, and Atusko all
brought sweets!  Mayumi and Toshie both did homework!</p>
