      <description>19:51 Thursday 11 July 2019 JST Today there were only 1.5 students in my Akihabara class. This number is down from our high of like 8 last year when I had to stop checking homework during the lesson because there ended up being no time for class. I guess there would be time with just 2 students&amp;rsquo; worth of homework.
Anyway, the lesson kinda devolved into a China vs Japan debate.</description>

      <description>20:43 Thursday 18 April 2019 JST I had some time before the lesson in Akihabara and ended up buying some squishy toys that were even cooler than the one I bought late last year. These have balls inside them about the size of frog eggs, and the outer balls stretch about as much as a frog&amp;rsquo;s lower mouth. The inner balls squirt out between fingers and make an awfully squirty sound that is somewhat between stepping in mud and a cartoon splat.</description>

      <description>17:54 Thursday 14 December 2017 JST After working 3 hours (5 lessons) near Lazona, I&amp;rsquo;m eating cold lunch in Akihabara across the street from GG lesson. I have Lin&amp;rsquo;s sister&amp;rsquo;s heavy-as-hell suitcase. (Now I know why gorillas cannot break them)
19:41 Lesson was great; everyone was there! Yoko, Maki, and Atusko all brought sweets! Mayumi and Toshie both did homework!</description>
