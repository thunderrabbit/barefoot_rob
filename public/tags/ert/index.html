                        <p class=date>26 September 1998</p>

<p><p>Today I was frustrated (again) at my computer so I decided to go to Astroworld.  I have a season pass and I&rsquo;ve hardly used it; I think this is my 3rd time to go this season.  (Strictly speaking I&rsquo;ve gotten my money&rsquo;s worth out of it, but only 3 times??)</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty much tired as heck, so I&rsquo;ll keep this short.</p>

<p><p>I got there around 4pm and paid my 5 bucks to park.</p>

<p><p>Before the park closed at 8pm, I rode Greased Lightning 9 times, Dungeon Drop 4 times, The Viper 2 times, Taz&rsquo;s Texas Tornado 2 times, Texas Cyclone 2 times and maybe Excalibur 1 time.</p>

<p><p>After the park closed at 8pm, the following rides remained open for a private party:  Viper, Excalibur, Mayan Mindbender, Dungeon Drop.  In 2 hours, I rode  Viper 3 times, Dungeon Drop 4 times, Excalibur 8 times, and Mayan Mindbender 7 times.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Mayan Mindbender is a small indoor coaster with no lights on the coaster.  The cars on the train are designed to each seat up to 2 people in a single file manner.  

<p>I sat in the last seat.  The first time, I found that I could get my left leg on the other side of the bar to where my right leg should be.  I rode the ride looking backwards.

<p>The second time, I completely switched my feet and faced my entire body backwards, with my knees down where my feet should go.. I was like kneeling backwards in the car.

<p>Another time I rode, I faced forward, but while sitting on top of the lap bar instead of under it.  I gripped the hand bar in front of me as if riding a motorcycle.

<p>A few times, at the very end of the ride, while the train was moving slowly back into the light, my car was still in the darkened section of the track, and I stood entirely up in my car.

<p>Each time, I was able to get seated correctly again and act like Mr Innocent.

</blockquote>

<p><p>Oh, when I rode Excalibur, I was able to grab leaves and grass from the trees and ground, and I started collecting them in a pile in the &ldquo;garage&rdquo; of the coaster.  That is something I did as a youth at Astroworld 10-14 years ago.</p>

<p><p>Today was really a day for me to play and play.</p>

<p><p>So anyway, it was a private party and I didn&rsquo;t get kicked out because I happened to be wearing a wristband from YMCA Camp Cullen, which I&rsquo;ve had on for like 6 weeks now.  It looked vaguely similar to the wristband that each person in this private party had to wear that I got 2 hours of exclusive ride time.</p>

<p><p>Yeee!!!</p>
