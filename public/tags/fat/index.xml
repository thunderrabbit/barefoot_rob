      <description>18:21 Sunday 23 December 2018 JST Lin and I joined her sister and sister&amp;rsquo;s daughter for a circuit of IKEA and then buffet. I put rechargable batteries into the cart but tried to slow down the rate of other items coming into the cart. Lin wants to buy a new light but did not measure the existing space to know how low a new light could hang.</description>

      <description>09:02 Thursday 22 February 2018 JST Yeah so last night against my better judgement, I ate at night. I mean it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a ton, but maybe 1&amp;frasl;2 kg, including a bunch of sugar.
This morning my stomach is like &amp;ldquo;ugh with a big fat ball of fat&amp;rdquo;
Lin felt about the same, so I made a contract with her to not eat after 9pm, 32 times in the next 38 days.</description>
