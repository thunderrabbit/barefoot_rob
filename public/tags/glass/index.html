<p>There is at least one downside to having glass doors.  I walked right
into one while it was closed.</p>

<p>Jennie has a pet door in our room now so she can go in and out.  The
door has a lock so that it can work both directions, neither
direction, or this xor that direction.</p>

<p>The guy cut a hole in the glass and it was not like on Mission
Impossible.  He used a diamond tip to make a circle and then a smaller
circle, and then a grid of cuts in the middle of the small circle,
then tap tap tapped with a metal rod.  It was nothing like silent spy
stuff in the movies.</p>

<p>Allow more time when going to the glass museum in Azumino.   Or maybe
just go early.  We went around 10:45 and there was a queue for blowing
glass until 1pm.</p>

<p>I did get to talk to a couple of guys down in the glass blowing room.
Was soooo happy that they did not turn me away for being barefoot.  I
could easily imagine a rule, but apparently there was not.  Anyway I
had no problem with glass so it was fine.  Anyway, I also had no time,
so did not get to make a bottle or glass or anything.  Not sure what I
would have made.  Probably a glass, since it would be most useful for
me.</p>

<p>This is the first time I have worked with glass.  Basically melted the
end of a glass rod and tacked some colors onto it after the sensei
wrapped it onto some sort of ceramic to which the glass apparently
won&rsquo;t adhere.</p>

<p>Lin took pictures during the process and then when I finished was like
お疲れ様です。 and I was like まだまだ and asked the sensei if I could
make another.  She was like, &ldquo;of course&rdquo; and Lin was like &ldquo;bye&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For the second one, I asked if I could use two colors within one
bead.  She was like &hellip;. and I was like pleaseee and she agreed
頑張ります。  Yay!</p>

<p>When rolling it onto the ceramic stick, she did a few different
layers, so it will look kinda like a candy cane.  Yay!</p>

<p>Hmm I wonder if I should do one more with opaque glass and clear
glass.  Hmm I think I will.  But she is only here tonight so I have to
do it now.</p>

<p>Yayyyy</p>

<p>After a woman made her own bead, she and her, um, friend watched me
attempt my idea of clear glass surrounding blue glass with yellow
stripes in between both.</p>

<p>Sensei fixed it after I gooped it all up, but I hope it works out
nicely.</p>
