      <description>15:12 Friday 27 October 2017 JST Jennie has a pet door in our room now so she can go in and out. The door has a lock so that it can work both directions, neither direction, or this xor that direction.
The guy cut a hole in the glass and it was not like on Mission Impossible. He used a diamond tip to make a circle and then a smaller circle, and then a grid of cuts in the middle of the small circle, then tap tap tapped with a metal rod.</description>

      <description>12:46 Saturday 19 August 2017 JST Allow more time when going to the glass museum in Azumino. Or maybe just go early. We went around 10:45 and there was a queue for blowing glass until 1pm.
I did get to talk to a couple of guys down in the glass blowing room. Was soooo happy that they did not turn me away for being barefoot. I could easily imagine a rule, but apparently there was not.</description>

      <description>19:30 Friday 18 August 2017 JST This is the first time I have worked with glass. Basically melted the end of a glass rod and tacked some colors onto it after the sensei wrapped it onto some sort of ceramic to which the glass apparently won&amp;rsquo;t adhere.
Lin took pictures during the process and then when I finished was like お疲れ様です。 and I was like まだまだ and asked the sensei if I could make another.</description>
