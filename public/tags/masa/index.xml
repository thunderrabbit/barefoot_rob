SOGO was a lot easier for me this weekend probably because it was not so blasting hot as it&amp;rsquo;s been during the summer. I was basically able to do most of the exercises without giving up partway through as I have done in the past.
After the workout, I joined a small group for lunch at a Thai restaurant. At my table: Asaad, Kino, Alex, Rafaela, Tatsuya, and maybe someone else.</description>
