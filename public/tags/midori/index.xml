      <description>22:07 Wednesday 27 February 2019 JST Actually not lunch, but after the NWTA meeting, I worked on AB and then hung out with Tomoko from 2:05pm to 2:50pm. Midori was off today, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see her. We talked about badminton and Mari-chan, who is in the badmintion group and happened to be with Tomoko when she let me in.</description>

      <description>17:58 Wednesday 14 February 2018 JST Tomoko did well in our lessons in the SSC. She had to give a presentation in English today. Midori does not have to present as soon so she is trying to memorize more, it seems.
Lessons were after we ate lunch together on the 4th floor. I still kinda feel like an outsider there, as if my face and Visitor badge are flashing beacons.</description>
