<p>Lin&rsquo;s friend Mikako came over last night, a night I was originally
scheduled to be out at an ET contact event.  They made gyoza as I lay
on the couch, not feelin&rsquo; all that hot!  Not sure why.  i&rsquo;m feeling
genki 95% this morning, though so I&rsquo;m headed to see Travis, Yumi,
Matt, and Calire, and maybe others.</p>

<p>Last night I was also planning to go to Japanese class, but I skipped
it to chill with Mika.  I showed her how to do LastPass, and she was
like, &ldquo;ohhhhhh&rdquo; and &ldquo;すごい！&rdquo; maybe.  She had seen it before but not
100% seen it in action.</p>

<p>Gyoza was delish (of course) and we stayed up late chatting about
nothin&rsquo; and stuff.  I took an instagram pic of my light and Mika in my
bed from the vantage point of my futon from last night.</p>

<p>During the night I moved from futon to couch and then finally slept a
couple hours on Lin&rsquo;s bed.  It was just like musical beds!</p>

<div class="dream">
In a school, Lin and I walked up some steps to a counter where we were
to pick up our tickets for travel.   The guy was like, do you have
your stripe card? which I had been given but couldn't find at that
moment.  I found it latler in a different pocket of my wallet (change
compartnemtn) and moved it to the first plae I had looked for it,
while thinking of the LPT I had seen regarding this, though Iit was
already a practice I practice.  On the boat, we were headed from Viet
Nam back to Japan and were looking at options for travel.  One way was
shorter but had strong currents against us, but we chose that way
anyway and were turning into the current area when the driver got back
in the boat and I had been turning it.  We were next to some other
boats in this industrial waste wasted sea and there was no food from
the ocean, but a guy had broght ramen.  Lin was looking for food as
she didn't want to eat industrial waste and I was just going to go
hungry instead; it was only one more day.

<p>##18:25 Sunday 21 December 2014 JST##</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the TLDR:</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve just left on our Shinjuku-bound bus.  Basically today was a
great day at Fuji-Q Highland, and based on very limited information, I
think Fujiyama may be the most popular ride in the park. It seemed to
have the longest line at any given time.</p>

<p>We rode big coasters eight times:</p>

<pre><code>Fujiyama * 2
Takabisha * 2
Dodonpa * 1
Eejyanaika * 3
</code></pre>

<p>Also rode several rides on time each (capitalized if I know the (romanji) name):</p>

<pre><code>Hamu Hamu Okuri  (hanging coaster for kids)
bicycles  (pedal powered bike on flat track)
Mad Mouse (mousetrap coaster)
ferris wheel
Red Tower (drop tower)
Tondemina (swinging frisbee)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="end-tldr">(end TLDR)</h3>

<p>I took notes during the day on my phone:</p>

<p>##9:35##</p>

<p>line for Fujiyama</p>

<p>##10:15##</p>

<p>got to pass about 20 people at entrance because it&rsquo;s just me and Lin.</p>

<p>Fujiyama BACK CAR!!! (7.14285714286% chance)</p>

<p>Nice air time on at least three drops!</p>

<p>##10:25##</p>

<p>line for Takabisha</p>

<p>##11:13##</p>

<p>front seats! (50% chance)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s such a lovely smooth ride!!</p>

<p>##11:22##</p>

<p>in line for Ejyanaika</p>

<p>##12:00##</p>

<p>haha I did thinking pose for the photo. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but pretty okay.</p>

<p>##12:12##</p>

<p>in line for Hamu Hamu Okoku, the ride which used to be called Birdman or something back until like 1997 I think</p>

<p>##12:29##</p>

<p>aww man the photo op isn&rsquo;t on the right</p>

<p>##12:33##</p>

<p>no line for bikes!!</p>

<p>##12:45##</p>

<p>essentially no line for 60 meter drop tower, Red Tower</p>

<p>##12:50##</p>

<p>no line for Tondemina!</p>

<p>Haha oops Lin didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>

<p>##13:03##</p>

<p>pizza now. She says good thing we ate after Tondemina instead of before!</p>

<p>##13:24##</p>

<p>in line for Mad Mouse</p>

<p>After a little diversion to see the haunted house line is too long, 70 mins (plus 500 yen to pay the <del>actors</del> <ins>ghosts</ins>)</p>

<p>##14:00##</p>

<p>in line for Ejyanaika. The line is a bit shorter this time!</p>

<p>I did the thinking face again, but it was no better than the photo we bought.</p>

<p>##14:30##</p>

<p>in line for Ejyanaika!</p>

<p>They are only running one train.</p>

<p>The first two times, we took the left entrance. This time we are waiting in the right hand entrance.</p>

<p>I plan to &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; for the photo this time.</p>

<p>##15:16##</p>

<p>sleeping photo turned out okay; Lin really seemed to like it!</p>

<p>##15:41##</p>

<p>riding in clear plexiglass car on Ferris wheel</p>

<p>##15:54##</p>

<p>in line for Dodonpa, which Lin has not yet ridden. The line doesn&rsquo;t even go down one entire ramp.</p>

<p>The first time I rode, I think the line was about two hours long.</p>

<p>##16:24##</p>

<p>in line Takabisha</p>

<p>##17:04##</p>

<p>Lin said it wasn&rsquo;t so scary this time.</p>

<p>##17:07##</p>

<p>in line for Fujiyama</p>

<p>##17:37##</p>

<p>looks like we are going to be in the front car! (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub> chance)</p>

<p>##17:53##</p>

<p>so cold!!</p>

<p>##18:03##</p>

<p>in line for crepes!!</p>

<p>I got blueberry and Lin got chocolate. Now getting postcards.</p>

<p>##18:12##</p>

<p>in line for the bus!!</p>

<h3 id="end-notes-from-phone">end notes from phone</h3>

<p>Lin prepared several bean burgers, which we ate during the day,
interspersed with snacks both from home and from the park.</p>

<p>I got soft serve ice cream from a a stall staffed by a woman who ws a
bit older than me.  I took a picture of the ice cream with Francois
and she mentioned that she had a real rabbit (as if Francois isn&rsquo;t
real!) and I asked to see the picture.  He&rsquo;s white and black with a
Charlie Chaplain mustache; she calls him ロロ, &ldquo;Roro&rdquo;, which is a
shortened form of しろ+くろ</p>

<p>I bought two packs of Mt Fuji postcards which I plan to send to people
via Fiverr.</p>

<p>All in all the weekend was lovely, successful, comfortable, fun, and delicious.</p>

<p><strong>8:29pm Wednesday 10 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>Lin and I were both feeling kinda sick last week. I&rsquo;ve not meditated in a while, though I might start soon. We&rsquo;re feeling mostly better now, but I&rsquo;ve still got some congestion.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m writing. Lin is talking about starting a diary. I&rsquo;m fully supportive of such things, and hope she gets a lot lot lot and tons of benefit from it. Online or offline is fine; I can give her some tips and encouragement.</p>

<p>My main tip for any kind of diary writing, especially if you wanna do it for a while:</p>

<p><strong>write the full date at the top of every entry</strong>. Or the bottom. Or both. But the point is do NOT just write <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> cause I promise, even if you can be sure you meant April 10th and not the 4th of October, you may be hard pressed to remember the year. And even if <em>you</em> can remember the year, someone who finds the diary after you will <em>not</em> remember the year. I use 4 digits for the year (how shortsighted of me!!!), always write the month out as a word, and almost always write the time as well, including am or pm.</p>

<p>The next most important tip might be the most important:</p>

<p><strong>start writing again if you have a lapse.</strong> And don&rsquo;t try to catch up. In my handwritten journals, I remember having stopped writing because I got all busy. I wanted to write again, but I was like &ldquo;ah crap; how will I write everything that&rsquo;s happened in 4 months?&rdquo; That thought blocked me from writing for a month. Then I was like, &ldquo;oh crap; how will I write everything that&rsquo;s happened in 5 months?&rdquo; <em>That</em> thought blocked me for a month until I realized the futility and just wrote what happened that day. I released the need to write about the prior 6 months and just started writing as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Other tips that are not as important, but may be useful</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In a handwritten diary, leave a couple pages in front blank to be an index.  Fill it in with highlights once the book is full</p></li>

<li><p>Every month or year or so, write an overview of your situation. I got the idea from the State of The Union Addresses in the US; I call them State of My Life Addresses.</p></li>

<li><p>Only read old entries if it&rsquo;s been a year since you wrote them.  Otherwise, don&rsquo;t read; just write.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When I got home from the iOS meeting, Lin was watching Shawshank Redemption on TV via our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_On_demand">video-on-demand</a> service. I joined her once the final rape scene was over; up to that point, I don&rsquo;t really like the movie. When the final credits rolled, I said, &ldquo;oh, I thought that was Tom Hanks,&rdquo; and she was like, &ldquo;no that was Green Mile.&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen Green Mile,&rdquo; and she goes WHAT?? and I was like, WHAT??? and she was like WHAT???? and I was like WHAT??? for about a minute.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s been wanting to see A.I. as well so she went and rented A.I. and Green Mile for 100 yen each.   I chose to watch A.I. instead of Green Mile last night because A.I. is shorter, and I&rsquo;ve never known Lin to watch an entire movie (late at night on our couch) without sleeping.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen A.I. a couple of times, and when I watch it, I always think of Chez who was really moved by the movie.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t cry this time while watching it, though I have in the past.</p>

<p>We did watch the &ldquo;making of A.I.&rdquo; this time, whereas I hadn&rsquo;t in the past.  I wonder <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+kubrick+died">how Kubrick died</a> (<em>he types, while seated in front of a portal with high speed access to essentially all of humankind&rsquo;s information</em>).</p>

<p>I was reminded of an interesting article about Kubrick&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Shining&rdquo; as his confession that he helped make footage for Apollo 11 missions.   <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kubrick+shining+apollo+11">kubrick+shining+apollo+11/a&gt;</a></p>

<p>Lin, Ma, and I went to a university library where we were looking for books or something.  I saw Christine and helped her find a book (which was unavailable ever since a KTRU dj had mentioned its greatness on the air).  Christine needed the book for a report due in April, but the book cost $91 so she wanted to borrow it from the library.</p>

<p>It was time to go, but we couldn&rsquo;t find Lin.  I was looking around for her in the crowds of people chilling in the park-like atmosphere of the university campus.  I saw Fred had just arrived and was like, &ldquo;yo have you seen Lin?&rdquo; but he had not so I was like, &ldquo;moe joe where is she?&rdquo; and then I realized I hadn&rsquo;t checked my phone.  I checked and she had listed out all the reasons this is a bad relationship, in some sort of free-form brainstormed list.</p>

<p><code>this is a bad relationship!</code></p>

<p>first the gasoline
then the rice
nb kind of kid</p>

<p>somehow I am passing
my accounting class</p>

<p>yay</p>

<p>no thanks to you</p>

<p>And I started to cry and I slid the phone to my mom, &ldquo;I found Lin,&rdquo; but she didn&rsquo;t hear me. moe joe, so thankful to wake up!</p>
