<p>Lin and I have been talking a lot about her plan to live/work in Thailand for a year.</p>

<p>Being apart for an extended time will be hard; I know!  I see it as an extension of our relationship into a new realm.  What&rsquo;s it like to be together and be apart for a decent bit of time?</p>

<p>Lin has &ldquo;always&rdquo; wanted to travel and see other parts of the world.  That&rsquo;s exactly how I came to Japan, and gave up a whole life with great friends and great Wende to do it.   Even when I found another great life with janette, I was like, &ldquo;yeah, no&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t settle here, all the way up in Dallas, when the original goal was <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> way around the world.   When janette dropped me off at the airport, it didn&rsquo;t hit me until I went through the gate.  Boom crying like a baby &ldquo;what the hell am I doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got on the airplane having never been to Japan, hardly knowing the language (still don&rsquo;t, considering how long I&rsquo;ve been here.  Sorry, old Rob), and I remember how fucking hard it was to have no physical contact once I got here.  I got trolly comments on my journal when I was just wanting a hug.</p>

<p>So, I know it will be challenging, and I also know it will be growth.  For both of us, but especially for Lin.  She&rsquo;s wanted to travel for years but hasn&rsquo;t; she&rsquo;s been taking care of her family over taking care of her own dreams.   It will be growth for me and my desire for hugs.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll buy a (few) FREE HUGS t-shirt(s) to wear around town.   Maybe I&rsquo;ll spend more time in meditation to activate my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini">kundalini</a>, instead of having all this energy in lower chakras.</p>

<p>I think of the whole experience as divine spiritual growth for each of us and both of us together.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve mentioned, but the first time I washed Lin&rsquo;s back, I had a brief experience of déjà vu, &ldquo;wow; Lin and I have done this before!&rdquo; So I know we&rsquo;ve had at least one other incarnation together, and I suppose many many many incarnations together.  In this one, while we&rsquo;re deeply in love, we are planning to be physically apart for a bit.</p>

<p>My part includes maintaining my job and this apartment where Lin can come back anytime.  Her part includes releasing everything so she can live alone for the first time in her life.</p>

<p>I got up this morning thinking I should get some Thai flash cards for Lin, so I&rsquo;ll look for some now.</p>

                        <p>##00:51 Sunday 23 December 2012</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not quite great with the caretaking.  For example, when I came up to the table to just sit, they were like, &ldquo;do you want sushi?  do you want rice?  do you want cake?  which do you want?&rdquo; and I was like, &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo; and then boom a plate appeared and food that I didn&rsquo;t want was presented.</p>

<p>Um.</p>

<p>I noticed how spoiled the kids are. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just <em>these</em> kids, but I&rsquo;ve heard rumors and anecdotal evidence that it&rsquo;s like this for many Japanese kids. Every whine, pout, request, was immediately pandered. Ugh.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t touch the 9 month old baby without washing hands first. Why? Don&rsquo;t we want to build up his immune system?</p>

<p>When the 2 year old was trying to pull Lin&rsquo;s iPad away from the 6 year old who had been playing with it, I saw them doing a little tug of war. I was like, &ldquo;false,&rdquo; and simply removed it from the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>Playing hide and seek with the kids was fun, reminding me of Fred and I playing hide and seek.  But I was bemused by how entertained they were with so few places to hide.  I mean, there were three places to hide:  (kneeling under the table, standing on the lee side of a shelf, and standing behind the door of the room).  Anywhere else would be immediately visible when someone entered the room.  I showed them a fourth place to hide, made by moving the very light couch a bit forward and lying down behind that.</p>

<p>I found an excellent hiding technique which I wasn&rsquo;t able to implement: climb over a counter and through the door to the next room (which was blocked by the counter).  I couldn&rsquo;t use it because the room into which I would vanish was adjacent to the waiting area used by people before trying to find the hiders.  Hmm.</p>

<p>I wore shoes today (for the first time since May *) because it was cold, and wet, <em>and</em> I have three (3) skin splits (as opposed to shin splints?) on my left foot. My right foot is fine.</p>

<p>(* except for the day I went to get my visa, and two days I went to meet my client for business meetings)</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s making some small and big stretches in her life&hellip;  This Christmas she&rsquo;s making some gifts for family (instead of just buying stuff).    (that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m calling the small stretch.)</p>

<p>The big thing about which I&rsquo;m super impressed: she just applied for a new job &hellip;. in Thailand!!  Wow!  She&rsquo;s always wanted to travel, and I&rsquo;ve always said, &ldquo;so when are you going to do it???&ldquo;   I&rsquo;ve kept telling her, &ldquo;no you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> have to have X first,&rdquo; where X for Lin has usually been &ldquo;money&rdquo; or &hellip; I guess permission from her [self/family].</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s definitely got permission from me!  I look forward to visiting her in Bangkok, and taking her to see Chiang Mai!</p>

<p>Lin and I went on an impromptu date tonight, first visiting the ramen place adjacent to Kawasaki station, but turning away from its 20 minute line.</p>

<p>We were going to go to the cheap and delicious Chinese place with the cute-nosed waitress, but then I suggested we try Taro&rsquo;s restaurant.  Taro stands out on the corner soliciting customers, and has a super genki personality that piqued my curiosity enough to try the place.  Plus he speaks English (and German, and Spanish,) and Japanese.</p>

<p>4000 yen for not enough to fill us is not enough to bring us back again.  Sorry, Taro.</p>

<p>SO, we went to the Chinese place to get ramen and gyoza.  The cute girl wasn&rsquo;t there!!!  I was glad she had a day off (she always seems to be there when we&rsquo;re there), but then she came back a bit after we arrived.  Yay!  I mean boo!  I mean Yay!!</p>
