<p>Lin and Ma joined me on the way to SOGO.  They watched from a bench
across from the tree where SOGO peeps generally meet.  Workout was
great fun, though a bit hard since I haven&rsquo;t attended in a while.
Unfortunately I won&rsquo;t be able to attend for two months starting in
October.  I&rsquo;m bummed about that, but work is work.</p>

<p>Egad I am missing SOGO again (4 times in a row)</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s nice to see Lisa and Miho!</p>

<p>Actually only Lisa is with us while Lin is driving, and they are all
blah blah blabbin chat chat chattin and missed a turn recommended by
GPS.  Twice.</p>

<h2 id="11-33-sunday-16-july-2017-jst">11:33 Sunday 16 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay we just got Miho yay!</p>

<h2 id="13-07-sunday-16-july-2017-jst">13:07 Sunday 16 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Only 1 hour (4.9km) to go! <del>Yay!</del></p>

<p>I could have fucking gone to SOGO and take the train down to meet Lin
and them. fack.</p>

<h2 id="14-00-sunday-16-july-2017-jst">14:00 Sunday 16 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>We arrived.  So hard for me to understand how driving is preferable to
Lin.</p>

<h2 id="18-31-sunday-16-july-2017-jst">18:31 Sunday 16 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Okay okay the day turned out to be pretty good.  We had a nice time by
the ocean (not beach; it was all layers of volcanic rocks tilted at an
angle)</p>

<p>After we set up our tent and chairs, Lin found the same little pool
that we enjoyed 2(?) years ago.  I guided Miho there with the fewest
vertical changes, and then carried all our stuff to the spot.</p>

<p>Got into the water slowly; it was cold and wavy over sharp shells.
There is a still pool nearby where the water is a bit warm in the top
meter or so.  The warm pool had some anemones in it which I think may
have stung Lin, Miho, and Lisa.  I got poked by one so went out a
different direction.</p>

<p>We pet the cat at the ice cream shop with a cat and Lin did a cat
impression while I took slo mo video.  Not sure it is worth putting
online, but she seemed surprisingly not embarrassed by it, so she
might.</p>

<p>I climbed with Francois up a slightly steep hill next to the car and
then threw him down to get funny pictures.  Lin tried to throw him
back and he ended up in a place that required judicious use of the
parasol pole Lin bought for this trip.  Glad it came in helpful!</p>

<p>Lin was all set to buy Shungite from Renee, but we ended up with not
enough time to do so after going to Haruka lake and shrine.  The lake
was fine and the shrine was nice, but because we were late leaving
because of this extra trip, neither Lin nor I really took the time to
enjoy it. I did get a couple of pics, but nothing like wow holy shit
this was worth being late.</p>

<p>Once we got back to our car and on our way home, we had 1.25 hours to
travel what is turning out to be 3 hours, or exactly the amount of
time Lin intended to use to get home.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am not interested in being the manager of tours or any
variant of a tour guide.  Gonna have to pass on this one.  Montana
moment and all that.</p>

<h2 id="20-09-saturday-15-july-2017-jst">20:09 Saturday 15 July 2017 JST</h2>

<p>Turned out fine.  The AC guy said because they missed the problem the
first time, they would fix it for free, and we do not have to be there
to let them in because it&rsquo;s related to the outdoor unit.</p>

<p>I joined Lin who met her co-workers in Kamakura for a going away party
for one of the managers.  Aki had a Canon <em>film</em> camera with a short
little lens, so I offered to give her the slightly longer lens that
came with my Canon EOS.</p>

why I get pissed off at people talking over other people.</p>

<p>Breakfast was lots of veggies for me and a larger variety for Lin.
The restaurant had a Pepper robot in front, but it wouldn&rsquo;t follow me
when I beckoned it.  It faced me, but didn&rsquo;t come with me.</p>

<p>Gotta pack and bounce outta here.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m the first person in the departure lounge!</p>

<p>The bus was pretty much full: full sized, and full of people.  Plus
there was another bus which left at the same time.  Plenty of
travelers woke up early in that hotel.</p>

<p>Lin is driving me to Narita airport because my check-in time is 7:25

on time (if I leave from our house tomorrow).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to stay in a hotel <del>(rar)</del> and after she drops me off at the

<p>We drove up to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Bonnell">Mt Bonnell</a> for marriage
ceremony delivered by Ma and witnessed by Jon, kT, and Alicia.  Fred
couldn&rsquo;t join due to migraine.</p>

<p>Up the steps from the parking lot, I walked barefoot, and asked Lin to
take picutres of me for the TV thing.</p>

<p>There were so many people near the top that we couldn&rsquo;t get a very
good view, so we headed down the hill a bit and found a stone on which
we stood for the ceremony.  Ma put on a colorful stole and did a quick
freestyle service, addressing friends and family for our happy
occassion.  We hadn&rsquo;t specifically prepared vows, but Ma asked if we
would hold hands and offer Promises(*) to each other.</p>

<p>I promised to be supportive and a good listener and a couple other
things.  Lin did likewise, and we got cheers from some supportive
onlookers after we kissed!</p>

<p>Super thanks to them, though we didn&rsquo;t take time to meet them as we
had to get back to top then back down for dinner with Susan.</p>

<p>At the top I chose not to climb onto the &ldquo;roof&rdquo; of the overlook
because there were too many kids around.  After Lin and I walked down
to the city side of the view, we came back up and there were kids on
the roof!</p>

<p>(*) Promises were an idea which came from Karina&rsquo;s wedding, which came
from Karina&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s wedding.</p>
