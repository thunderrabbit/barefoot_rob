<p>Usually Lin checks in with me on her way home, but she has not checked
in with me yet.  I wrote this to Mark on LINE:</p>

<pre><code>23:00 barefoot Rob Nugen Just checking in now; Lin is not home and not answering her phone or LINE
23:01 barefoot Rob Nugen It's possible she is out with friends, but usually she tells me if she will be late
23:01 barefoot Rob Nugen I won't seriously worry until after last train
23:02 barefoot Rob Nugen I do not need any support now, but I will let you know if I do.
23:02 barefoot Rob Nugen I assume she will come home, so from your point of view please treat this as
                         no news is good news.  i.e no further updates from me means she came home fine.

<p>She called me; she is fine, just was out with co-workers due to
someone&rsquo;s last day at work.</p>

<p>Lin and I walked around our neighborhood, which couulllddd possibly
count as a Walk that I started doing last year and dropped after
getting to 14 or so.</p>

<p>During this walk, I practiced a process I heard on an Esther Hicks
video recently.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my favorite rock.  You&rsquo;re my favorite leaf.
You&rsquo;re my favorite tree.&rdquo; etc</p>

<p>I found the transcription at the bottom of
<a href="https://grandledgeucc.org/mt-content/uploads/2019/06/sermon_06_09_2019.pdf">this PDF from a church newsletter(?)</a>
I look forward to finding the video where the transcription came from.</p>

<pre><code>1. Meditate for 15 minutes every day. Getting centered and
   clearing your mind can make a world of difference in our feelings.

2. Go outside no matter what the weather and move around in
   appreciation of this planet. Look up and around and find things
   to acknowledge, and talk about them right out loud: say things
   like: you are my favorite bird, you are my favorite flower in
   bloom, you are my favorite flower not in bloom, you are my
   favorite tree, you are my favorite frog, who kept me awake all
   night, you are my favorite rock. etc

3. Buy a notepad, call it your Book of Positive Aspects, and fill
   5 pages of positive aspects about a thing or subject or a person.

4. And the last thing. Every single day look upward and outward,
   best if you do it outside or standing near a window, and
   acknowledge that there are Universal Forces, God, focused right
   at us, and then say: 'I acknowledge that I am the object of
   your positive attention, and I'm appreciating your continual
   gaze on behalf of my well-being, and today, no matter where I
   am, no matter where I'm going, no matter who I'm doing it with,
   I will be in conscious awareness that you too are there with
   me, appreciating me, supporting me, assisting me, acknowledging
   me, inspiring me, guiding me, having fun with me, helping me,
   being aware of me, loving me, showing me, uplifting me...  get
   into an endless loop of that kind of acknowledgement, and watch
   what happens in your life.

<p>Lin and I replanted the sakura tree which we planted (too close to the
wall) last week.  There was a slight gap in the rain so we took the
chance to move the tree.</p>

<p>I was thankful I had done a careful job of packing mud and nutritious
leaves for the tree last week.  I was able to dig those up and reuse
them today.  To be honest I was a bit frustrated by the end and just
wanted to get it done, and then Lin bumped her head quite hard on the
window frame that extends out from the house.  (it sounded like a
heavy rock falling onto the ground).  I wanted her to stop working and
go inside, but she wanted to clean up the final bits of mud.</p>

<p>Most interesting about the whole thing was when Azuma-san came by and
said we didn&rsquo;t need to move it; the tree would have been fine 20cm
from the wall.  He showed us the tree near his wall as evidence.
Hmmm.  It&rsquo;s a different kind of tree, but fair enough.</p>

<p>It turns out I like the bag Lin bought online better than the bag I
bought in a shop last year.  The wheels on her bag are larger and
quieter.  That was something I could not test on the linoleum tile
floors in the shop.  That sounded perfectly smooth there, but out on
the street they are raucous.</p>

<p>And this bag has more pockets.  I thought I could survive with the
number of pockets on the other bag, but this one is way more pockety</p>

<p>Lin and I enjoyed a great productive day today, starting with a romp
after calling my mom on voip.</p>

<p>Main things for me: work on AB, fix bicycles.  Lin wanted to clean the
house a bit so she did that while I worked on AB.</p>

<p>We walked our decrepit bicycles to a local shop.  Mine had to get a
new chain; Lin&rsquo;s bicycle needed a new valve stem and new seat.</p>

<p>While the bicycles were being fixed, we walked to the station to get a
case for Lin&rsquo;s new work phone.   Walked back to the bicycle shop and
road our renewed rides back home.</p>

<p>Just got back home, though we left Yomiuriland around 5pm.  Pretty
early from my point of view, but they were both tired.</p>

<p>Good times.</p>

<p>In preparation for this trip, I started my packing list a few weeks
ago.</p>

<p>I had planned to copy it here, but for now, just imagine it.</p>

<p>I pre-packed most of the list a couple days ago, getting down to
computer, phone, and other
stuff I could not pack because I use it daily.</p>

<p>This morning I woke up early, and repacked everything, doublechecking
the list, and taking pictures of all of it, in some kind of just in
case scenario that will not happen.</p>

<p>This morning Lin drove me to the old man skin clinic to get a bit of
cream for my leg, and then met me at the Narita-bound Limousine Bus
stop at Shin Yurigaoka station.</p>

<p>We enjoyed lunch at Ootoya then hopped on the noon bus, which arrived
in Narita by 2pm.  So sweet of Lin to come with me!  We snuggled and
laughed in the back of the bus, then wandered around Narita for a bit
after I exchanged 10k and 20k yen for 105 CAD and 175 USD,
respectively (plus a bit of yen change).</p>

<p>We got soft serve ice cream and then wondered at all the shops in the
airport.</p>

<p>Sat down for about 30 minutes for more snuggles and then finally time
to say adieu.  After going through customs, I called Lin through Line
and waved bye to Lin looking down through the glass as I stayed in
place, walking up the down-escalator until someone else came.  (Almost
no one in line at security / customs.)</p>

<p>I got a quick pass for my new passport so I can whiz through
immigration in Japan until 2023.</p>

<p>Now I am at the gate, just a few minutes before boarding begins.</p>

<p>Lin and I got off to a later start than I had originally planned, but
we walked an hour around our neighborhood, finding some new streets we
had never used before and arriving via different routes in places we
had been before.  &ldquo;Oh!  we&rsquo;re <em>here</em>!&rdquo; kinda thing.</p>

<p>Wow!  3.9km in 58 minutes, according to Google maps.</p>
