      <description>17:06 Tuesday 23 January 2018 JST I woke up early to take pics of the snow and then helped scoop some of it up. I cleared a couple paths in a couple hours. It was pretty warm while working.
It&amp;rsquo;s about dark now; I have been inside on my computer, preparing to do my US taxes, on time this year (for a change).
Oh and I did an hour of MT3, but did not write an entry for it.</description>
