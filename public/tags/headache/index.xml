      <description>Last night when I finally went to sleep around 11 pm my brain was pounding headachey and my eyes were vibrating in a strange way like, not in a good way.
I chalk it up to too much time spent on my computer.
it kept me awake for a while, but I was finally able to calm myself down into sleep.
I&amp;rsquo;m on my way to the dentist now, recording this with voice transcription.</description>
