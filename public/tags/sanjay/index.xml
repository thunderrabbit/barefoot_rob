      <description>21:14 Sunday 30 December 2018 JST Dear Rob, Glad to see you email. I have gone through the website and there are a lot of improvement which can be done. Please check one of our Hugo based website - https://www.nathanaherne.com – If you’ll see on Home page – we have shown important section of the site briefly and with pictures. Same I’ll propose for this website i.e. we can show 3 or 6 Workers with Images, 3-6 Tracks, One Step with picture.</description>
