      <description>6 May or so 2018 I got a weird bump on my leg. Doctor gave some antibiotics.
  
11:20 Friday 11 May 2018 JST Today is my first health update my journal. I&amp;rsquo;m actually writing via voice recognition because I am not supposed to use my left wrist right now.
I went to the clinic and the doctor took x-rays and said there is some calcification on the bones in my wrist.</description>
