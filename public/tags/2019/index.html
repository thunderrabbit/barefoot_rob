<ol>
<li>Yesterday I walked from Shinjuku to Hiroo, from the men&rsquo;s group new
meeting location to our old one.  Last night we met for the last
time at Takeshi&rsquo;s office, and next week we will be in Shinjuku, at
a place I have not yet seen.  I have booked it for all of September
and October, and trust we can get it for longer if we like it.</li>
<li>I did my first workshop last month (Eye Gazing, on August 17th).
We had a great turnout so I am planning to do it again on September
28th.  Yay!</li>
<li>Last night Mark gave me the idea of doing workshops for a living.
It certainly fits my skillset <a href="/journal/2019/09/03/brain-pounding-eyes-vibrating-too-much-computer/">moreso than programming</a>!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 now features CSFERP (Caret Splitter Feeder
Extenstion Reflection Protection), put in place yesterday by
Reversible Guy.</li>
<li>I have not yet gotten into the groove of writing blog entries, but
recently I have put that on my daily ROBOT pages as a 10 point todo
item.</li>
<li>I have been keeping daily ROBOT pages since May, thanks to Hiro for
the idea.</li>
<li>I had my first session with Dean Ramsden.  It was less illuminating
than I guessed/hoped it might be, but I have different sets of
questions for next time.</li>
<li>Lin and I have been doing better over the past month or more,
mostly because I have been chilling tf out and being more
accomodating for communication styles and grammars.</li>
<li>I got AB&rsquo;s DB moved to AWS RDS.  Yay!  Thanks to Travis for
introducing me to Ansible.  Thanks to Ansible for making things
replicable.</li>
<li>I created a Page on FB.
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/barefootrob/">Barefoot Rob</a>.  I
resisted giving in to the borg for a long time, and still want to
keep my content on my server, but they make it so dang easy!</li>
<li>I am ecstatic with the turnout from
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2465227863708851/">my first Eye Gazing workshop</a>;
14 people attended, incluing myself.  I have scheduled a second
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/493730671447073/">Eye Gazing workshop</a>
for Sep 28th, and a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2054284838201319/">Remembering Past Lives</a>
workshop for September 7th.  Looking forward to both!</li>
<li>I have been fascinated with the idea of channeling information
from non-local sources.
<a href="https://www.bashar.org/">Bashar via Darryl Anka</a> is the first
that I paid attention to, and now Abraham via
<a href="https://www.abraham-hicks.com">Esther Hicks</a>.  I wonder about
developing my own channeling skills.</li>
<li>Jennie is still our cat. Lin recently said Jennie is 7 years old.</li>
<li>I still do not have a driver&rsquo;s license in Japan (nor the US, since
my old license expired).  Lin wants me to get one, but I do not
really want to drive in Tokyo.  Especially not have to drive her
&ldquo;big&rdquo; minivan.</li>
<li>I showed up 25 minutes late to my online group today and no one
was there.  It&rsquo;s like my worst dream come true, after I had just
written a page of gratitude to the men of the group for keeping it
going while I am not in attendance.</li>

<li>My old thunderrabbit router conked out so now we are using a new one
with three antennas and mutiple channels and all that good stuff.</li>
<li>The conking coincided with new printer disallowing login so I reset
the networking and therefore lost the few scan-to-ssh profiles I
had set up.  I have half of them restored and a few new ones
planned.</li>
<li>This allows me to scan A4 pages and upload to my b.robnugen.com
server (b stands for binary).  Most of them are going to be in
<a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/">https://b.robnugen.com/robot/</a> (where robot represents for R.O.B.O.T., which
stands for my personal <a href="https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Category:R.O.B.O.T.">religion I made</a> after reading
<a href="https://archive.org/details/shavinginsideofy00ashm">Shaving the Inside of your Skull</a>
by Mel Ash) whereas others will be in other directories</li>
<li>I have started writing my dreams and scanning them to
<a href="https://b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/">https://b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/</a> In the future I hope to
have an automagic way to display thumbnails, allow paging through
the images, transcribing them, and naming the files nicely.</li>
<li>For now, the filenames created by the scanner include date, name,
topic, and a counter which shows the order in which they were
scanned.</li>
<li>I recently discovered I apparently applied to JB in October 2014 (I
think)</li>
<li>I have recently scheduled two (2) workshops. Oh snap I should
invite people to them.</li>
<li>August 17th <a href="Eye
Gazing Workshop">https://www.facebook.com/events/2465227863708851/</a>, which will allow people to really connect deeply
to themselves and others in a safe heart-filled space</li>
<li>The next workshop is scheduled for September 7th, a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2054284838201319/">past life memories workshop</a>.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s been several days since I started item 9 above, and I just
finished it by adding the link.</li>
<li>The past several days have been filled with working on AB.  I am
pretty close to having a migration path to get them onto RDS with
almost no downtime.  After that will be to have their web server
deployable via script.  Thank you Travis for having introduced me
to Ansible some years ago.</li>
<li>Rainy season has finished so now it&rsquo;s typhoon season. wait, what?</li>
<li>11 people are signed up for the workshop on Saturday.  I&rsquo;m super
looking forward to having a great experience with everyone.</li>
<li>I got
<a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/templates/2019/R.O.B.O.T._Daily_Pages_version_2019_Aug_14.pdf">my Daily ROBOT page</a>
fixed enough that I am thinking of taking the time to make an HTML
version so I can track its history.  I used
<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">Libre Office</a> to make the PDF so I
wouldn&rsquo;t have to muck with CSS, etc.  But now I want to make a
clean CSS version.  Possible?  Nah forget it.  PDF versions are
fine for now.</li>
<li>Our cat Jennie is doing fine.  She sleeps like a log instead of a
bun because it&rsquo;s summer.</li>
<li>Just yesterday or so I started listening to my CDs from
<a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org/">The Monroe Institute</a> which I
bought after taking the week long
<a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org/Gateway%20Voyage%20Program">Gateway Voyage</a>
back in 1996 or 1997. It still works!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 most recently got the Lower Zig Zag 3ban Lower
Support, and the Lowest Largest U-turn Berm glued into place.  I
plan to work on it a bit more today.</li>

                        <p>In two weeks I will be leading an Eye Gazing Workshop near Shibuya
station.</p>

<p>To help plan my first workshop, Rin asked me to choose something that
made me really excited.</p>

<p>I told her I would have to think about it, and a couple days later it
suddenly came to me as the perfect workshop.</p>

<p>After determining what I wanted the final outcome to be, the workshop
plan went through a few iterations, with support from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/babay0ga/">Georgie</a>, Mark Wild,
<a href="https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/">Soness</a>, <a href="https://www.shamanism-asia.com/">Kevin Turner</a>, and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://concreteplayground.com/sydney/event/eye-gazing-2">Georgie has been doing eye gazing workshops for years in Australia.</a></p>

<pre><code>They say our eyes are the window to the soul.  This workshop will give
us a chance to look more deeply into ourselves and more deeply into
those around us.

The process is simple, and the results can be profound.  You may
discover parts about yourself that you didn't know where there.

In this workshop, we will be looking into the eyes of people that we
may never have met before.  We will have a chance to sit with multiple
participants, with a small break in between each person.

It's important to have an intention before each eye gazing practice,
so be sure to have some possible intentions in mind.  Some examples
might be

“I intend to get to know myself better”
“I intend to connect with my intuition”
“I intend to practice acceptance of others”
“I intend to practice acceptance of myself”

Let’s enjoy learning about ourselves and each other.

<p>Location: between Shibuya and Shinsen stations on Dogenzaka</p>

<li>I met Yuri Logo today to talk about making a logo for my brand.
She was recommended by Rin so I was like yay!  She asked lots of
questions and said she had good ideas for it.  I could see in her
smile the excitement and I felt good about that.</li>
<li>I will be working with Rin in a life coaching capacity.  I look
forward to an accountability partner and learning some new
facilitation techniques.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com">Marble Track 3 website</a> now has a
Construction section, which shows some of the snippets.  Not all
the snippets are there, and they are not all fully fleshed out yet,
but I look forward to finishing that section, especially if I can
do it via a data file which can be parsed in differen ways.</li>
<li>Lin has been enjoying her new job and will soon get to have flex
time hours, going from 10am to 6pm.  Hopefully the trains will be a
bit less packed in the mornings.</li>
<li>We bought a laser printer recently.  I did it out of frustration of
buying tons of ink for the inkjet printer, and now I realize what a
great investment it is.  Now I can print pages like wheeee instead
of having a gut wrenching wonder if I would get streaks in the
pages.</li>
<li>I used the printer to print a flyer for our Japanese workshop
coming up in July.</li>

<p>Some people could not scan the QR code, so I made one with a normal
square QR code <a href="https://b.robnugen.com/mkpjapan/workshops/2019/Japanese_Journey_of_Heart_July_square_QR_code_2019.png">https://b.robnugen.com/mkpjapan/workshops/2019/Japanese_Journey_of_Heart_July_square_QR_code_2019.png</a></p>

<ol>
<li>I just recently decided to plan on attending a workshop in Houston
in October.  (ShadowWork Facilitator Training) I have not gotten it
sorted out with the organizer yet; I asked him if I have the
prerequisites.</li>
<li>I bought <a href="https://wanb.us/">https://wanb.us/</a> which I might use for my Urbit star, ~wanbus.</li>
<li>I created a template for something like a Five Minute Journal
(which takes more than five minutes, but gives a structure to what
I write).  Kinda like a captain&rsquo;s log, tracking some different
metrics: eating, sleeping, meditation, books, exercise, kisses</li>
<li>I got the idea from Hiro, who has apparently been doing it for years.</li>
<li>After doing these for a few days, I thought it would be cool to be
able to print customized templates for people.  So if you have a
template you&rsquo;d like to print, send it to me and I can print it
out.</li>
<li>I think my knee chair has got to go cause it might be hurting my
knees and hips. I wanna get a yoga ball chair (again).  I will
request one on Freecycling Tokyo.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s now June 5th.  Yesterday I did my first session with Rin, and
came out with seven affirmations, organically discovered by doing
a (n apparently NLP) process that could be called &ldquo;What do I
gain?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What do I gain by not following my dreams?&rdquo;  (snip long chain of
answers and question repetitions featuring new answer) &ldquo;I know
people love me.&rdquo;  Wait, what??</li>
<li>It also makes sense though, in my experience of facilitating
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s at Risk&rdquo; hundreds of times.  When I go through that series
of questions, I end up with &ldquo;I will be alone&rdquo; (which is about the
opposite of &ldquo;I know people love me.&rdquo;</li>

<li>I will be traveling to the US for 22 days starting March 13th.</li>
<li>Not packed yet, but have it planned for next week.</li>

<li><p>I have just sent a list of workshops to Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle</p>

<p>Men, my stretch was to find workshops that we can do in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I have led #1 and #3 below.  As a group, we did #2 in August 2018
for ourselves, and then again in November 2018 for new men.</p>

<p>#4 can be done online, once a week for 5 to 7 weeks (2 hours per
 week).  This would require some coordination and a trainer from
 the US to help me lead.  I judge it would take a committment from
 6 men to make it worthwhile.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Head Heart and Soul is a 2 hour introduction to the work.  Men
and women can attend.</p></li>

<li><p>Circle of Men, Journey of the Heart is a day long experiential
personal growth workshop.  Men only, but could probably work
for women.  (6-7 hours, including lunch)</p></li>

<li><p>Life Mission workshop lets each man to discover his life’s
Mission, and actions which he can use to bring his mission
present in his life.  This can easily be done in 2 hours.</p></li>

<li><p>Circle Skills training for the classic archetypal MKP-style
integration circle (this gives a solid framework for sitting in
circle)</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>I got a new battery, but it has not worked right.  I understand now I
need to disable sleep mode and let it reallllly run out all the
way.  Dangit.</p></li>

<li><p>Marble Track 3 has over 300 hours of livestream of me making it.</p></li>

<li><p>I probably will not mess with the website for a bit, but the idea
of making it better is tempting.</p></li>

<li><p>The website is at version 2, mostly purple and made by Sanjay and
team in Deli, India.</p></li>

<li><p>The GoFundMe has made $4000+ which more than covers the tickets for my
trip.  We need to set up a company here to keep track of
everything.</p></li>

<li><p>That means I need to start collecting receipts, cause they are
getting pricey!</p></li>

<li><p>I had a killer headache this past Monday from too much
computering, I think.  I can feel another coming on, but I will
head to be soon.</p></li>

<li><p>I am shutting my computer down now/soon and will let the battery run alll the way down</p></li>

<li><p>I think I have a way to fix ConSwi without relying on physics to
keep bricks from going through each other.</p></li>

<li><p>I wanted to work on it today, but did lots of MKP stuff</p></li>
</ol>

<p>2019 is pretty easy to type because the numbers are right next to each
other on both sides of the keyboard.</p>

<p>Lin and I went to her sister&rsquo;s house for new years celebrations.  Went
to karaoke and then a Chinese izakaya (fusion?) before going to the
local shrine where some guys were burning bamboo in metal drums.</p>

<p>We arrived home about an hour before 2019 and took turns taking
showers.  (I got to wear Toru&rsquo;s clean underwear, t-shirt, and dress
shirt.  Thank goodness because mine smelled like smoke after the
restaurant.)  All clean, Charu arrived back in the living room at
23:59:48.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!  Hugs all around and a kiss for Lin then headed home
soon thereafter.</p>
