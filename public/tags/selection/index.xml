      <description>18:43 Tuesday 19 May 2015 JST 柴田さん showed me a new-to-me game at the toy store. Roll a bunch of dice and players take turns selecting as many of the same-color / same-face dice that they wish. The person who is left with the last die is the loser.
She was shocked that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen the game before!
We also played with the tops, one of which was a round block of wood with a pencil for its axle.</description>
