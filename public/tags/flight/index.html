<p>I am certainly getting tired.  I did not sleep the last 4 hours of the
flight as planned.  I kept working on Godot and then watched the last
couple or three episodes of Lucifer season 2.</p>

<p>The flight was scheduled to be 14 hours, so I have been awake about 17
hours since my last entry.</p>

<p>Okay, yes I woke up at 20:47 and it is now 14:49 the next day.</p>

<p>So, call them 20 and 14, so actually 18 hours as of this entry.</p>

<p>It is 01:49 Monday 1 January 2018 in Tokyo, and I should be sleeping
soon, but I guess we won&rsquo;t sleep for 1.5 hours after we land, so about
2 hours from now.</p>

<p>As soon as I thought to write &ldquo;flying home,&rdquo; I got a little pang of
guilt.  Isn&rsquo;t my home Houston?</p>

<p>Anyway, the flight from Perth to Honkers was a bit long, but fine.  I
slept for most of the first six hours and then watched the movie CHiPs
because it was listed as a comedy, but ..  it was pretty dark if it
was a comedy.  Suicide, lotta violence; I turned it off as the final
scene was ramping up.</p>

<p>Before getting on the flight from Honk Kong to Narita, I spoke a bit
with a couple on the flight.  I realized about halfway into the convo
that I had asked him where he was from, but not asked her.  They are
on a 13 day tour in Japan including Hakone, Nagoya, Takayama (not sure
where that is), Kyoto, Osaka.</p>

<p>They are sitting in row 50+ and I am in row 60+, with no one beside me
though I had decided I would make an effor to talk to the person who
sat beside me.</p>

<p>I have been sleeping about 1.5 hours at this point, and now have
written the above while waiting for the commercials before my selected
movie, The Transport, or something.  Ah, no, it&rsquo;s called The Passengers.</p>

<p>We took off ten minutes early, and I&rsquo;ve just had a nice nap.  Got
several neat pictures on the way up, but I wonder if I&rsquo;ll ever post them.</p>

<p>Gonna work on date difference calculator.</p>

<p>ps: I&rsquo;m nearly done with proof of concept of my days old counter, but
I have just discovered the
<a href="https://github.com/xrexonx/dateDiff">dateDiff</a> library I snagged
doesn&rsquo;t allow dates from the 1800s.  Do I care?  Hmmmm.</p>

<h2 id="00-09-thursday-13-october-2016-awst">00:09 Thursday 13 October 2016 AWST</h2>

<p>I cared enough to make it handle dates from 1700 to 2599.  <a href="https://github.com/thunderrabbit/javascript-days-old-counter/commits/master/js/rDateDiff.min.js">https://github.com/thunderrabbit/javascript-days-old-counter/commits/master/js/rDateDiff.min.js</a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re about 25 minutes out.  Lin and I both slept well, so I&rsquo;m pretty
sure we&rsquo;ll have no jet laggin&rsquo; issues.</p>

<p>My sinus is quite itchy sneezy&hellip;  while my mouth was chewing the
grape that came with our breakfast, my nose was like, &ldquo;time to
sneeze!!&rdquo; and I had to work hard to override it!  I was thinking, &ldquo;you
guys want some grapes???&rdquo;</p>

<p class=date>9:20am Monday 3 August 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>I'm in seat 24A of Continental flight 1989 about to leave for ConCon. Celine Dion's "My heart will go on" is playing quietly over the speakers as two boys with English accents talk with their parents behind me, including "if I sit heah, I con't see tha TV."

<p>This weekend I got all my planned activities complete, including transcribing all my SWUUSI journal entries, updating the Houston YRUU (pronounced "why are you you" short for Young Religious Unitarian Universalists) webpage, seeing my mom preach at Thoreau Congregation, and attending the youth worship last night, during which we decided to create a Houston YAC (Youth-Adult Committee) which can make the decisions that need to be made for the YRUU activities in the Houston area.

<p>On Saturday I went to Maggie and John's and met Wende out there for dinner and ate then left around 9pm and met Manda at IHOP after going to say HI to Rebecca at Indigo Angel who wasn't there so I left a note.

<p>Manda and I went to a park and chilled and swung on swings and climbed and slid down slides and rocked on a huge rocking gazebo and talked till like 1:30am. I went home and got to bed around 2am.

<p>The plane is now taxiing slowly through the terminal area.

<p>Last night I did a panic pack, including depositing checks and withdrawing cash, purchasing film and razors at Walgreen's, and finally got all my stuff packed and went to bed at 5am.

<p>Awake at 7am and Manda drove me to the airport and now I'm on the plane and here I am.

<p class=date>Monday 3 August 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>On the ground below I can see huge block letters of green (trees?) on brown dirt background:

<pre>LUECKI</pre>

<p>I wonder what the heck it means (city name?) or where it is...

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>We've been flying for about an hour and I'm seeing some intricate roadways that look like an old circuit board.  Pretty cool, but the weird thing is they don't see to go anywhere. The road ends, but there's nothing there.

<p>But I'm writing now because I think I just saw a particle accelerator, though I don't know of any in this area.  It was perfectly round, not cleared in the middle, and big. I don't really have a way to judge how big, but I'd guess 1/2 mile to a mile across.

<p>(I asked the pilot about it as I left. He didn't know for sure, but suggested it was a mine.  hmmm.)
