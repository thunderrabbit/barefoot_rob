      <description>14:45 Sunday 31 December 2017 -02 I am certainly getting tired. I did not sleep the last 4 hours of the flight as planned. I kept working on Godot and then watched the last couple or three episodes of Lucifer season 2.
The flight was scheduled to be 14 hours, so I have been awake about 17 hours since my last entry.
Okay, yes I woke up at 20:47 and it is now 14:49 the next day.</description>

      <description>10:46 Monday 09 October 2017 JST As soon as I thought to write &amp;ldquo;flying home,&amp;rdquo; I got a little pang of guilt. Isn&amp;rsquo;t my home Houston?
Anyway, the flight from Perth to Honkers was a bit long, but fine. I slept for most of the first six hours and then watched the movie CHiPs because it was listed as a comedy, but .. it was pretty dark if it was a comedy.</description>

      <description>10:19 Wednesday 12 October 2016 JST We took off ten minutes early, and I&amp;rsquo;ve just had a nice nap. Got several neat pictures on the way up, but I wonder if I&amp;rsquo;ll ever post them.
Gonna work on date difference calculator.
10:53 Wednesday 12 October 2016 JST in-flight breakfast!
ps: I&amp;rsquo;m nearly done with proof of concept of my days old counter, but I have just discovered the dateDiff library I snagged doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow dates from the 1800s.</description>

      <description>09:40 Friday 22 January 2016 PST We&amp;rsquo;re about 25 minutes out. Lin and I both slept well, so I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure we&amp;rsquo;ll have no jet laggin&amp;rsquo; issues.
My sinus is quite itchy sneezy&amp;hellip; while my mouth was chewing the grape that came with our breakfast, my nose was like, &amp;ldquo;time to sneeze!!&amp;rdquo; and I had to work hard to override it! I was thinking, &amp;ldquo;you guys want some grapes???&amp;rdquo;</description>

I&#39;m in seat 24A of Continental flight 1989 about to leave for ConCon. Celine Dion&#39;s &#34;My heart will go on&#34; is playing quietly over the speakers as two boys with English accents talk with their parents behind me, including &#34;if I sit heah, I con&#39;t see tha TV.&#34; This weekend I got all my planned activities complete, including transcribing all my SWUUSI journal entries, updating the Houston YRUU (pronounced &#34;</description>

      <description>Con Con flyin there
Monday 3 August 1998

transcribed from my diary
On the ground below I can see huge block letters of green (trees?) on brown dirt background: LUECKI I wonder what the heck it means (city name?) or where it is... We&#39;ve been flying for about an hour and I&#39;m seeing some intricate roadways that look like an old circuit board. Pretty cool, but the weird thing is they don&#39;t see to go anywhere.</description>
