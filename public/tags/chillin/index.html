<p>Ma came to the baggage claim area to wait for me!  We took the subway
(subterrainian electric vehicle that ran on rails that looked
relatively light) to the hotel and got some food there.  I marveled at
the size of the portions, <!-- and smiled at Meghan's braces, --> but
there was no in-flight meal so I finished what we ordered.</p>

<p>The veggie burger tasted somewhat like raw meat.  Not sure if I would
have enjoyed it if I thought it was real meat.</p>

<p>Ma and I did some real talk about when she and Dad divorced, so that
was nice.</p>

<p>She told me about a play that Jon is in, where his character actually
sits in the audience and interrupts the play near the end.</p>

<p>That sounds amazing, so I hope I can watch it sometime.</p>

<p>I am tired and writing this while sleepy; I am going to take a shower
and go to bed.  I do not have wifi access yet, so will have to take
care of that in the morning.</p>

<p>I think we thought the flight leaves at 00:15, in which case we would
begin boarding in 20 minutes or so.  But it&rsquo;s at 01:15 so we have 80
minutes or so.</p>

<p>Lin is shopping for souvenirs though our bags are overweight, and will
apparently cost $100 in Dubai because *they are very strict there&rdquo;</p>

<p>First time to hang out with Michael one on one.  We ate at a cafe in
the station and then went barefoot out on a balcony where we talked to
a mom waiting for her kid to come back from school.  Michael chatted
with her a bit, introducing us.. I was kinda amazed because even
though my Japanese is better, I&rsquo;m not as willing to break the ice with
people.</p>

<p>We went barefoot out to the river and came across some peeps playing
soccer so we joined them for a bit.  Had some good fun and ended up
with business cards to their restaurant in the area.</p>

<p>Helped a guy by the river who had gotten a fishhook caught in his
shoe.  We were not able to get it out (even though I could not find a
reverse hook on it; maybe it was much higher on the hook), but we cut
the fishing line to which it was attached.</p>

<p>Then played Follow The Leader for a bit, and Michael surprised me by
walking on a rail adjacent to the river.  Nice!  We will play again
sometime.</p>

<p>Talked about internet and stuff until after dark and then headed back
to the station.  His shoes were gone from where he had put them.  We
found a security guard who led us to them down in their office.</p>

<p>After working in Ebisu, I walked to Shibuya then took the train to
Harajuku and hung out with Mike R for an hour in Harajuku.  He said he
was feeling much better after his schedule opened up.  Looks like he
will attend Tokyo Men&rsquo;s Circle soon as well.</p>

<h2 id="1-20-monday-1-february-2016-cst">1:20 Monday 1 February 2016 CST</h2>

<p>Okay Fred and I have been up playing Minecraft.</p>

<p>Before that, we ate ice cream, and before that, we went to H.E.B. to
get ice cream and fun toothpicks.  Before that, we ate at Serranos
(sp), and before that we took pictures after playing Sorry!</p>

<p>Before that, we hung out in the garden and I climbed the tree in the
front yard.  Before that we sat with the dogs on the stairs after
arriving at Dad and Karen&rsquo;s house.  Before that Fred drove us here,
and before that we said bye to kT at First Church after saying bye to
the YRUUers there after saying bye to Jackie and Paul after saying
Hello to the YRUUers after arriving at the church after getting
overnight stuff at Ma&rsquo;s apartment after eating at Magnolia Grill with
Jackie, Paul, kT, after hanging out at Ma&rsquo;s apartment after Paul and
Jackie came, after kT arrived after 10am.</p>

<p>or something like that.</p>

<p>After an oopsy trip to Chiba, we went to the station after Yokosuka.
Got some Chinese food at a small shop with Chinese proprietors with
whom Joanna spoke a bit in Mandarin.</p>

<p>Went to see Eric&rsquo;s old house in the area, and in the same neighborhood
met an Australian guy named Geoffrey who had just moved into his house
9 months ago and has been reforming it since then.  Wow!  It looked
really nice, and he said it&rsquo;s the third house he&rsquo;s reformed in this
type of way, so Lin and I got his infos to see if we can have him work
on our new house, whenever we end up getting it.</p>

<p>Yesterday Chris and I were both a bit later than normal leaving our
lesson so we missed the train that we usually take.  The next train
comes 5 minutes later, but due to his train connections, Chris arrives
home 21 minutes later if he takes it.</p>

<p>I was like, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t gonna run, but feel free to if you like.  OR, we
can chill at the (next) station!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turns out the trains at the next station were late anyway, so chillin
was a great option!</p>

<p>I mentioned MJG&rsquo;s next book The Lost (which I&rsquo;m pre-reading now), and
Chris told me about his book/blog idea which I think could work!  I
told him I&rsquo;ll bug him about it to encourage its development.</p>

                        <p>##23:28 Sunday 04 January 2015 JST##</p>

<p>Today was our last day of vacation.  I worked on AB and chatted with
Lin a bit about ayahuasca.  Lin watched <em>Disclosure</em> and <em>The Green
Mile</em>.</p>

<p>Today, in remembered order:</p>

<p>##9pm</p>

<p>Around 9pm I was all &ldquo;Moe Joe I have a headache; I&rsquo;m going to lie down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>##daytime</p>

<p>I worked on AB website, adding to the reporting system.  The first
thing I tried resulted in code that ran way long, so I broke third
normal rules to make it run lightning fast.  Now I need to write some
code to populate the non-third normal bits.</p>

<p>#8pm</p>

<p>I took a shower and hot bath because I was feelin&rsquo; a bit blah after
coding so long.</p>

<p>#spoilers</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t seen <em>Disclosure</em> before, but I noticed Tom&rsquo;s phone didn&rsquo;t get
hung up when Meredith jumped his bones. I was like, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s either a
movie error or a plot device!&rdquo;</p>
