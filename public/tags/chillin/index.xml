Ma came to the baggage claim area to wait for me! We took the subway (subterrainian electric vehicle that ran on rails that looked relatively light) to the hotel and got some food there. I marveled at the size of the portions, but there was no in-flight meal so I finished what we ordered.
The veggie burger tasted somewhat like raw meat. Not sure if I would have enjoyed it if I thought it was real meat.</description>

      <description>23:16 Saturday 30 December 2017 -02 I think we thought the flight leaves at 00:15, in which case we would begin boarding in 20 minutes or so. But it&amp;rsquo;s at 01:15 so we have 80 minutes or so.
Lin is shopping for souvenirs though our bags are overweight, and will apparently cost $100 in Dubai because *they are very strict there&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>00:08 Saturday 09 September 2017 JST First time to hang out with Michael one on one. We ate at a cafe in the station and then went barefoot out on a balcony where we talked to a mom waiting for her kid to come back from school. Michael chatted with her a bit, introducing us.. I was kinda amazed because even though my Japanese is better, I&amp;rsquo;m not as willing to break the ice with people.</description>

      <description>20:49 Monday 22 May 2017 JST After working in Ebisu, I walked to Shibuya then took the train to Harajuku and hung out with Mike R for an hour in Harajuku. He said he was feeling much better after his schedule opened up. Looks like he will attend Tokyo Men&amp;rsquo;s Circle soon as well.</description>

1:20 Monday 1 February 2016 CST Okay Fred and I have been up playing Minecraft.
Before that, we ate ice cream, and before that, we went to H.E.B. to get ice cream and fun toothpicks. Before that, we ate at Serranos (sp), and before that we took pictures after playing Sorry!
Before that, we hung out in the garden and I climbed the tree in the front yard.</description>

      <description>17:13 Sunday 10 January 2016 JST After an oopsy trip to Chiba, we went to the station after Yokosuka. Got some Chinese food at a small shop with Chinese proprietors with whom Joanna spoke a bit in Mandarin.
Went to see Eric&amp;rsquo;s old house in the area, and in the same neighborhood met an Australian guy named Geoffrey who had just moved into his house 9 months ago and has been reforming it since then.</description>

      <description>05:23 Thursday 23 July 2015 JST Yesterday Chris and I were both a bit later than normal leaving our lesson so we missed the train that we usually take. The next train comes 5 minutes later, but due to his train connections, Chris arrives home 21 minutes later if he takes it.
I was like, &amp;ldquo;I ain&amp;rsquo;t gonna run, but feel free to if you like. OR, we can chill at the (next) station!</description>

      <description>##23:28 Sunday 04 January 2015 JST##
Today was our last day of vacation. I worked on AB and chatted with Lin a bit about ayahuasca. Lin watched Disclosure and The Green Mile.
Today, in remembered order:
##9pm
Around 9pm I was all &amp;ldquo;Moe Joe I have a headache; I&amp;rsquo;m going to lie down.&amp;rdquo;
##daytime
I worked on AB website, adding to the reporting system. The first thing I tried resulted in code that ran way long, so I broke third normal rules to make it run lightning fast.</description>
