      <description>08:49 Saturday 26 May 2018 JST Please support Net Neutrality. Otherwise, you are going to have to pay to get your message out to constituents.
In short, I want you and all your fellow member of congress to vote the opposite of whatever Ajit Pai suggests. As you can see on the ArsTechnica(1) website, Pai&amp;rsquo;s so-called &amp;ldquo;light-touch approach&amp;rdquo; of the previous 20 years actually consisted of much heavier regulation than exists today.</description>

      <description>08:45 Thursday 11 May 2017 JST Dear FCC, The FCC should stand up for Internet users by safeguarding net neutrality. The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to hand the ISP monopolies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping consumers of the necessary privacy and access protections we demanded and so recently won. I’m concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because I would like my small business to have a fair chance of success.</description>

Came in to work today to move AB from server which we didn&amp;rsquo;t totally control to one which we control a lot more. We still don&amp;rsquo;t have to touch the hardware, but now we have sudo access as needed.
The move was smooth; the longest part was waiting for DNS to update.</description>

      <description>##10:27 Sunday 17 February 2013
Regarding the new Safari search bar:
I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I can just type keywords and Safari knows I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to search for the invalid URL https://funny%20cat%20videos
But now all I see is &amp;ldquo;funny cat videos&amp;rdquo; where I would like to see the URL https://www.google.com/search?q=funny+cat+videos
The interwebs are based on the concept of hyperlinks, not hypersearchterms. It&amp;rsquo;s a pain for me now to use Safari to create links for sharing.</description>

2:51am Thursday 10 January 2013 as I write this. Just now about to go to bed after chatting with Lin a bit about the best way to get Ma and Fred to Shinagawa station. She wanted to rent a car to Shinagawa, but I think a simple taxi ride one way to Kawasaki will be faster and cheaper overall.
Chatted with Fred at the monthly apartment while he packed.</description>

I put an in-progress snapshot of Colleen&amp;rsquo;s painting on Koalas to the max.
Each time mouse cursor enters a circle, the circle will split into 4 circles, slowly revealing the picture (down to 7 levels of splits).
How many circles are in a fully revealed image?
(I think it&amp;rsquo;s 4^7, or 16384)
I posted an image in the Koalas to the Max! thread on trackmill forums</description>

This is a view from inside the hole I&amp;rsquo;m digging as part of a Minecraft art project I&amp;rsquo;ve got in mind. I plan to put a stop-action animation of the hole being dug on youtube. Earlier, while researching stuff for work, I found bigdinosaur.org, on which a blog entry was posted about something work related. mySQL or Javascript or some such. Anyway, in the side bar he mentioned he liked Minecraft.</description>

Not this URL, but this one: https://www.longbets.org/601/, or so the bettor suggests. I&amp;rsquo;m sure the URL will work fine, along with its friend https://longbets.org/601/ as well as future URIs in to-be-developed retrieval systems.
Anyway, I just thought the bet was interesting, so I took a couple screenshots.


I wonder if the URL for this blog entry will still work; I&amp;rsquo;ve been debating ditching Wordpress for another home built system, perhaps using an upgraded version of my old system.</description>

Regarding WiFi in Japan vs the US, Jesse wrote:
 We already have 4G in Japan&amp;hellip;. and it is already too slow but boasts speeds of 100mbps. 3g is only good for non-mobile systems. It only goes a max of 384kbps for mobile systems, and that is if it has a good connection&amp;hellip;

beacause the US is so concerned with &amp;ldquo;preserving the free market&amp;rdquo;, our government refuses to mandate a standard.</description>

Writely, the online word/blog processor, allows one to read/write/upload/save/collaborate text documents online, including, apparently, posting to one&amp;rsquo;s blog, which I am testing now.Props to writely crew for doing such a good job that Google has recently scooped them up in its plan to replace local storage with infinite storage online.Registration to writely is closed, except via invitation. Special props to Piet for inviting me!</description>

 Although ice cream can be easy to make at home, it is actually a very complex substance. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll learn how it&amp;rsquo;s made, what goes into it, and who invented it.

Wow! I never knew the complexities of ice cream!

This is the first post I&amp;rsquo;ve written after installing Ravi&amp;rsquo;s GeoPress - Wordpress Plugin for tagging your posts with location. I have put my West Gray address below this entry, and labled it 1211WGray. Clicked Embed Map and Save this location.
Now clicking publish&amp;hellip;.
No embedded map.. I wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s a problem with the string I put in the address field. It was &amp;ldquo;1211 West Gray, Houston, Texas, 77019&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m going to change it to &amp;ldquo;77019&amp;rdquo; and publish again.</description>

      <description>##18:32 Tuesday 08 November 2005
Just found a new site called YouTube, which has just received funding, which means to me they could have a good thing going.
The front of the site looks so much like google and gmail&amp;rsquo;s front page that my brain thought it must be associated with google.
Sign up by clicking here and I&amp;rsquo;ll get a referral.
I&amp;rsquo;m quite impressed with the site. I just uploaded two videos; it made thumbnails, permalinks; gave me HTML code to embed videos on my pages&amp;hellip; and it&amp;rsquo;s fast and free.</description>

 Google proposed to build an IEEE 802.11b/g Wi-Fi mesh network that delivers more than 1 megabit per second of capacity throughout the city.
 PCWorld.com - Google Describes its Wi-Fi Pitch
This would be pretty fresh&amp;hellip; A city where we could just walk around and be connected&amp;hellip; This would drive a market for cameras that upload to a blog and realtime wearable video cameras&amp;hellip; Wow.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog entry without being connected to the internet.? I wrote the one on Patch Adams, and then carefully saved the text so I could close flock and not lose what I wrote, but then when I open it back up&amp;hellip;?</description>

A few minutes after downloading, (given that I&amp;rsquo;ve already got a blog
set up (thanks, Dude!)) I am writing to my blog from flock&amp;rsquo;s
interface. I sure hope they don&amp;rsquo;t abuse my password which I&amp;rsquo;ve given
to my flock browser.
I think I should be able to do things with the blog entries listed
in the flock blog window (like edit the one on flock instead of having</description>

flock.com promises to be a new type of web browser, which breaks the concept of just being a single user in search of the last page of the internet. It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to let people&amp;rsquo;s browsing experiences merge together in some sort of internetally related hyperweb (I just made that term up) of similar interests that organically come out of browsing and linking slash bookmarking things we like.</description>

Wow. Google Earth rules.
I am 99% certain I have found Scott, my favorite car parked at my office at FSD about 3 or 4 years ago in Houston. That is awesome.
I sent a &amp;lsquo;bookmark&amp;rsquo; to myself (and Dude and Fred); I wonder if I can post it in here somehow.</description>

automatic image categorisation
This seems pretty sweet. Google could use this technology to further optimize its image search. I could use this technology to get the pictures on my website arranged!
Amazing to imagine that we are now living in a time that computers don&amp;rsquo;t recognize what&amp;rsquo;s in photographs. Seriously.</description>

Schmidt&amp;rsquo;s Google To Buddy Up With NASA - Forbes.com
This one looks pretty damn cool.
According to another article, Google will open up a million square feet worth of office space in NASA Ames research center.
My goodness it would be good to have a few hundred GOOG shares right about now.
Barring that, I look foward to seeing Google Mars and Google Moon. I want to see how they represent the alien station on the far side of the moon.</description>

This awesome extension is like a dream come true for getting into free registration sites.
mailinator.com is quite nice, but this is even faster.
btw, mailinator has a cool new look and more functionality, such as a semi-realtime spam map, showing where the most spam is coming from right now&amp;hellip;.</description>
