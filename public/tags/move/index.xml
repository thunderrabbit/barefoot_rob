      <description>14:11 Wednesday 01 June 2016 JST It&amp;rsquo;s actually more like packing, dismantling, finding cat pee, tossing. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a list on https://workflowy.com/ to help me keep my brain free. Jennie probably knows something is up, but does she suspect her whole life will magically transform into a new wonderland of places to pee?
How much of this shit should I throw away?
Should I go through and toss everything I haven&amp;rsquo;t used in a year?</description>

      <description>Okay, I&amp;rsquo;m moving my site again. Even though it was never totally moved in the first place. However, this new ISP webquarry.com seems like it will be a much happier place for my site to live. I&amp;rsquo;m messing with a lot of perl stuff, and the other ISP just wasn&amp;rsquo;t conducive (sp) to easy perl writing. I asked them if I could have access to the error output of my perl scripts and the answer I got was, &amp;ldquo;if you have an error in your script, you just need to have someone who knows perl go over your code with you.</description>
