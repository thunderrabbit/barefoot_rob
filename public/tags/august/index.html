<li>My old thunderrabbit router conked out so now we are using a new one
with three antennas and mutiple channels and all that good stuff.</li>
<li>The conking coincided with new printer disallowing login so I reset
the networking and therefore lost the few scan-to-ssh profiles I
had set up.  I have half of them restored and a few new ones
planned.</li>
<li>This allows me to scan A4 pages and upload to my b.robnugen.com
server (b stands for binary).  Most of them are going to be in
<a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/">https://b.robnugen.com/robot/</a> (where robot represents for R.O.B.O.T., which
stands for my personal <a href="https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Category:R.O.B.O.T.">religion I made</a> after reading
<a href="https://archive.org/details/shavinginsideofy00ashm">Shaving the Inside of your Skull</a>
by Mel Ash) whereas others will be in other directories</li>
<li>I have started writing my dreams and scanning them to
<a href="https://b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/">https://b.robnugen.com/journal/2019/dreams/</a> In the future I hope to
have an automagic way to display thumbnails, allow paging through
the images, transcribing them, and naming the files nicely.</li>
<li>For now, the filenames created by the scanner include date, name,
topic, and a counter which shows the order in which they were
scanned.</li>
<li>I recently discovered I apparently applied to JB in October 2014 (I
think)</li>
<li>I have recently scheduled two (2) workshops. Oh snap I should
invite people to them.</li>
<li>August 17th <a href="Eye
Gazing Workshop">https://www.facebook.com/events/2465227863708851/</a>, which will allow people to really connect deeply
to themselves and others in a safe heart-filled space</li>
<li>The next workshop is scheduled for September 7th, a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2054284838201319/">past life memories workshop</a>.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s been several days since I started item 9 above, and I just
finished it by adding the link.</li>
<li>The past several days have been filled with working on AB.  I am
pretty close to having a migration path to get them onto RDS with
almost no downtime.  After that will be to have their web server
deployable via script.  Thank you Travis for having introduced me
to Ansible some years ago.</li>
<li>Rainy season has finished so now it&rsquo;s typhoon season. wait, what?</li>
<li>11 people are signed up for the workshop on Saturday.  I&rsquo;m super
looking forward to having a great experience with everyone.</li>
<li>I got
<a href="https://b.robnugen.com/robot/templates/2019/R.O.B.O.T._Daily_Pages_version_2019_Aug_14.pdf">my Daily ROBOT page</a>
fixed enough that I am thinking of taking the time to make an HTML
version so I can track its history.  I used
<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">Libre Office</a> to make the PDF so I
wouldn&rsquo;t have to muck with CSS, etc.  But now I want to make a
clean CSS version.  Possible?  Nah forget it.  PDF versions are
fine for now.</li>
<li>Our cat Jennie is doing fine.  She sleeps like a log instead of a
bun because it&rsquo;s summer.</li>
<li>Just yesterday or so I started listening to my CDs from
<a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org/">The Monroe Institute</a> which I
bought after taking the week long
<a href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org/Gateway%20Voyage%20Program">Gateway Voyage</a>
back in 1996 or 1997. It still works!</li>
<li>Marble Track 3 most recently got the Lower Zig Zag 3ban Lower
Support, and the Lowest Largest U-turn Berm glued into place.  I
plan to work on it a bit more today.</li>

<ol>
<li><p>Today was the first day to teach at a restaurant in Hiroo. 10
students, most of whom are beginners, but all were able to get
through some language, including, but not punctuated as, &ldquo;how many
in your party please follow me here you are here is the menu what
would you like to drink please let me know when you are ready to
order&rdquo; and &ldquo;this is sirloin sukiyaki may I help you prepare it we
recommend rare but how would you like it cooked this is our
original sauce dip the sirloin in egg wrap it around rice and
enjoy&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Today was the second of five nights I substituted for Patrick at
AK.  At first, Eiko told me about how job and drew some pictures of
how plastic containers are made.  Then I reviewed the homework at
Mifuyu&rsquo;s request and suggested an article which she tried to print,
but wasn&rsquo;t able to, so I will print it and bring a copy next week.</p></li>

<li><p>Today is the first day back after the Gunma trip.  We have been
talking about it on FB; there were quite a few problems, but the
proprietor has been clear in how most of them were not her fault,
so it is hard for me to give further feedback.</p></li>

<li><p>I plan to do it, though; probably via email.</p></li>

<li><p>Goodness I almsot just fell asleep.  (I plan to leave that
misspelling of almost because it is indicative of my state.) I am
currently on the train headed to our station from Noborito, but I
was up at 5:10am or so and have not yet caught up on sleep after
the weekend.</p></li>

<li><p>I just realized that next week is the mikoshi thing but I do not
want to go.  I would rather join SOGO at the beach.  I need to RSVP
for SOGO, so if I forget to do that, I will do the mikoshi thing in
Kawasaki.  Gosh it would be a bummer to miss the beach.</p></li>

<li><p>Next station is my destination.</p></li>

<li><p>Today I missed my destination by two bus stops.  Then I went back
but missed it again, not knowing that on the way back the bus stop
names are not aligned across the street.</p></li>

<li><p>I have done 13 hours on Marble Track 3.  I plan to work on it
tomorrow.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not done enough work work recently (according to part of my
brain) so I plan to work some on paid website work this Friday and
Saturday.</p></li>

<li><p>Good to talk to Steve yesterday about IT stuff while he drove us
home (and dropped me off in Takasaki station)</p></li>

<li><p>Tomorrow night is the 1st or 3rd Tuesday of the month, so
therefore men&rsquo;s group.  Oh, I made a website
<a href="https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/">https://tokyo.mypowercircle.org/</a> I think it should be mkptokyo or
mkpjapan or tokyo.mkpjapan maybe.</p></li>

<li><p>We have one cat (Jennie) and no other pets or kids or anything.</p></li>

<li><p>I have not drawn any art for a long time.  I still own
amazeaweek.net but have not touched it nor wiki.robnugen.com for
quite a while.</p></li>

<li><p>Dealing with the aftermath of our Gunma trip may take a while, but
I am optimistic for getting it done by next week.</p></li>

<li><p>I walked from Tokyo Tower to Shibuya station today (with teaching
at the restaurant as a two hour pit stop in the middle)</p></li>
