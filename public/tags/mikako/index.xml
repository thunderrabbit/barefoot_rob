      <description>18:14 Friday 27 July 2018 JST Driving to Niigata is taking ages because of the speed limit and stuff, but we are having fun with Mikako in the car with us as Lin drives. I have never gotten a driver&amp;rsquo;s license in Japan, but it is long trips like this that kinda make me want to have one. Highway driving is no problem for me. It&amp;rsquo;s just the squirmy little streets near our house that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to navigate in a car (especially not a relatively big ass mini van like we have).</description>

      <description>11:49 Sunday 07 June 2015 JST Lin&amp;rsquo;s friend Mikako came over last night, a night I was originally scheduled to be out at an ET contact event. They made gyoza as I lay on the couch, not feelin&amp;rsquo; all that hot! Not sure why. i&amp;rsquo;m feeling genki 95% this morning, though so I&amp;rsquo;m headed to see Travis, Yumi, Matt, and Calire, and maybe others.
Last night I was also planning to go to Japanese class, but I skipped it to chill with Mika.</description>
