<p>I wanted to swap the commas a bit so I rewrote the commit messages
with <code>git rebase 68a8c08</code>.  Now the top of <code>git log --oneline --graph --decorate
--all</code> looks like this (sans colorization):</p>

<pre><code>* 7dc0917 (HEAD -&gt; master) back
* 10b1b54 some,
* 35be077 well,
* 0bd1c8b several
| * 84efab7 (norigin/master, github/master, bitbucket/master) some
| * 143640e well,
| * a8b25db several,
|/
* 68a8c08 years
* 34b1460 ago
* b62b05e when
* 8f33818 he
* 7ce3602 was
</code></pre>

<p>After writing this, I started composing a message on <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/">english.stackexchange.com</a></p>

<pre><code>I am writing a story in which an US American man is being
interviewed.  The man is relaying a story which happened in the
past.  To describe how long ago it happened, he uses the word
&quot;some&quot; and then wants to revise it to &quot;several (years ago).&quot;

Without punctuation, it would be transcribed as

... that was back some well several years ago when he was still ...

I am debating between adding commas to indicate pauses either as

A. that was back some, well, several years ago when he was still ...

or

B. that was back some well, several, years ago when he was still ...
</code></pre>

<p>but ended up not posting it as there are several answers already.</p>

<p>I broke my upload process, but I think it is fixed now.</p>

<p>Yep.  It took 65 seconds to process and upload to my server, but it
works.</p>

<p>When trying to get that number down, to a few seconds, I
mis-remembered how it was set up and destroyed the <code>public/</code> directory
of my Hugo-controlled site thinking Hugo can rebuild it, but since the
Hugo directory is already a Git repo, it was conflating the two, and
things got really confuzzed.  Including my brain.</p>

<p>I am considering removing dates from the content itself and just keep
them in the frontmatter.</p>

<p>What if I make them small like this:</p>

<h5 id="16-19-friday-14-september-2018-jst">16:19 Friday 14 September 2018 JST</h5>

<p>I<del> guess i</del>t will be an h5 tag, cause I put five # marks in front.</p>

<p>The above shows a weird thing that happened to my git repo while I was messing with Fossil.  The commit 6086901 is the first, and the commit 354c77e is the last, but it was shown right in a row.</p>

<p>This is the current top of the commit. Turns out the weird append was due to two different branches having identical, but non-related histories.</p>

<p>I <code>git push --force</code> to break it and fix it again.  Not sure if I went
with the original history or a new one.</p>

<p>I wrote the comments above to fix the layout of the commits.</p>

<p>For some reason when I <code>fossil push</code> it says wrong project, and it pushes the project properly.</p>

<p>New regular students in SS lesson this morning; Kaede stopped coming
relatively soon after joining last year, and Chika apparently took my
bitcoin advice (whereas I did not haha) so she moved overseas.
Satoshi has not come recently, and Sayuri said she was busy today,
plus said Ayano something something so could not come.  Nonoka and Ai
came today.  Ai helped Nonoka with some phrases and months of the
year.  We played a little month game asking the date of Christmas,
Halloween, Tanabata, White Day, etc.</p>

<p>Now I am in a cafe on ground floor of Muza watching pigeons and peeps
walk, fly, and or meander through the breezeway.</p>

<p>Fossil is awesome, but I am not ready to switch quite yet.</p>

<p>Can I get Fossil to host my journal like I have Hugo doing now?
Should I?  The point was to have it as a static site, so I guess not,
but it seems weird to use something that can host sites just to track
the site content and not host the site.</p>

<p>ConSwi is not open source, but it is sufficiently small and
not-production that I might try.  AB is equally not open source, but
definitely not small.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>So far, I only know a couple commands in Fossil and they seem longer
than equivalent git commands, but I have not read even a, well, I have
read a fraction of the Fossil docs, but not a lot.</p>

<p>Goofing around with Fossil, I discovered my commit message project has
been going for a bit over a year.</p>

<h2 id="23-13-wednesday-11-april-2018-jst">23:13 Wednesday 11 April 2018 JST</h2>

<p>Ack I can&rsquo;t start Fossil on ConSwi right now because I have a bunch of
unstaged/uncommitted changes as I do open heart surgery on the project</p>

<p>I need to go to sleep instead of trying to think about how to sort
this out right now.</p>

<p>I created a subdirectory in my git repo, initiated a git repo in it,
then added the subdirectory to the parent repo.  Boom it looks like
it&rsquo;s a submodule.</p>

<p>I got my repos sorted today; all the journal entries have had
frontmatter lobotomies if Middleman can&rsquo;t deal with the different
dates, and my main Middleman repo includes the journal entry repo as a
submodule.</p>

<p>However, turns out netlify doesn&rsquo;t clone recursively (yet).  I
mentioned this to Mathias and he was like, &ldquo;hmm you&rsquo;re right&rdquo; and said
he would look into it.  But, he said politely, he was planning to go
home for the night and didn&rsquo;t want to push any possibly-breaking
changes before going to bed.</p>

<p>HAHhahaa most def.  We&rsquo;ll see if they get it sorted out soon!  Then
I&rsquo;ll have a temporary space for journals before I figure out how
Middleman does deploys natively, decide what URL to use (hakyll?  but
it&rsquo;s not Hakyll anymore&hellip; hmmm), and set it all up.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll go with new.robnugen.com until it&rsquo;s a site that can take
over for all the crap on robnugen.com now (fat chance?) then kill
robnugen.com as I switch new.robnugen.com to www.robnugen.com.  Damn
what a lot of <del>broken links</del> <ins>redirects</ins> I have
planned!</p>

<p>Today I made a repo to help find particular md5 strings for
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/live/thjep4nr9895">Counting with md5sum</a>.  It&rsquo;s
my

<p>Also gave
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BitTippers/comments/2wthev/parenthood_giveaway/cou3aof">10000 bit tip to a man</a>
who
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BitTippers/comments/2wthev/parenthood_giveaway/">announced his wife was pregnant</a>.</p>

<p>And am working on a maze for Angelos, and printed a logo for a photo
at Shibuya Crossing tomorrow.</p>

<p>Okay good night!</p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>I thought it would be a good idea to hardcode my directory into my
Hakyll binary, so now, until I remember how to build the Hakyll
binary, I have to have it work from the ~/journal directory.  However,
I now want my ~/journal directory to be my new repo consisting of only
journal entries.</p>

<p>I moved the Hakyll version of ~/journal to ~/journal-hakyll and moved
my real journal to ~/journal, then added ~/journal as a subrepository
of the Hakyll journal in ~/hakyll-journal.</p>

<p>That required some gymnastics each time I wanted to test the repo.  To
test the Hakyll journal, I had to swap the directory names back and
then do the test.  But to import any changes from the new journal repo
into the Hakyll journal, I had to re-swap the names to their new
configuration.</p>

<p>Bah, so I manually replaced &ldquo;journal&rdquo; with &ldquo;journal-real&rdquo; in
~/journal/.gitmodules then did a pull to get the latest changes.</p>

<p>Kablam!  git pulled <em>itself</em> as its submodule and my repo got hosed
beyond what I could untangle without access to internizzle.</p>
