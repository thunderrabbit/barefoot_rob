      <description>15:40 Wednesday 27 December 2017 -02 Lin and I ate lunch with R &amp;amp; D and D&amp;rsquo;s auunt R and three of R&amp;rsquo;s nephews. I took the longest to eat due to chewing chewing chewing. The meat was a bit tough given that we arrived near the end of their lunch session. D drove me, Lin and his aunt R in the Range Rover, while R drove his three nephews in a rental car.</description>

      <description>17:52 Monday 26 June 2016 JST Yay! Mitsue came to the second half of the TESOL course taught by Rob Waring. We both found it to be quite useful. Went for non-alcoholic drinks at convenie afterward and I griped about the state of Apple as I see it.
No gripes about seeing Mitsue!</description>

      <description>13:00 Monday 25 January 2016 PST Great to get some extended time with closer family. John (who danced like a pro last night), Karen, and Maya (who politely refused to dance last night) all had to leave a bit earlier, but we hugged them bye and chatted about 35 more minutes during which time Mike de-res&amp;rsquo;d, and Lin presented Karina with the にゃんがる hoodie featuring cat ears and a pouch for cats (1 at a time, probably).</description>

      <description>12:57 Sunday 05 April 2015 JST Just finished lunch with peeps after seeing Miraikan first floor exhibits. I forgot to write during lunch; we&amp;rsquo;re leaving now.
13:04 We&amp;rsquo;re in line for the floating flower garden.
Downstairs there were several interesting interactive exhibits. My favorite was a table with 300cc colored wooden blocks. Cameras above the table would detect the blocks and lights above the table would project rivers between blue blocks, planes flying between yellow blocks, railroad between red blocks, and highway between green blocks, and maybe helicopter landing pads on purple blocks (maybe).</description>

Lin and I are headed to Paola and Jon&amp;rsquo;s for lunch, and then I&amp;rsquo;m going to meet Nate at 3pm. Skype Nate at 5:30pm.
Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m still grouchy because of infuriating XCode, though I&amp;rsquo;m getting over it by doing something non-Apple related.</description>

Going to lunch with M, with whom I zip lined on Sunday.
##15:00:11
We ate at Wired Cafe on the east side of Shinagawa station, then walked two blocks east, then south along the river, then across the river on a blue bridge, and saw some bicycle rental place called &amp;ldquo;bike sharing&amp;rdquo; though we&amp;rsquo;d have to pay.
Continued south on the east side of the river to a large black metallic structure shaped like an O when viewed from the river, but like an n when looking parallel to the river.</description>
