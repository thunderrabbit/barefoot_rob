      <description>13:53 Friday 04 August 2017 JST I tried getting Cyberduck to talk to Amazon S3, but could not do it as easily as I was able to get it to talk to Dream Objects S3.
Last time I used duplicity, I included GPG in the mix, so the files are encrypted. I apparently did not put the key in a safe place so they are effectively bricked.
This time, no GPG, and I have set the files to be public (but I do not know where / how people can access them).</description>
