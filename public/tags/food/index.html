<p>Lin and I joined her sister and sister&rsquo;s daughter for a circuit of
IKEA and then buffet.  I put rechargable batteries into the cart but
tried to slow down the rate of other items coming into the cart.  Lin
wants to buy a new light but did not measure the existing space to
know how low a new light could hang.</p>

<p>Yeah so last night against my better judgement, I ate at night.  I
mean it wasn&rsquo;t a ton, but maybe <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> kg, including a bunch of sugar.</p>

<p>This morning my stomach is like &ldquo;ugh with a big fat ball of fat&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lin felt about the same, so I made a contract with her to not eat
after 9pm, 32 times in the next 38 days.</p>

<p>Good time at Gekko, though a bit expensive overall.  4500 yen for 3
hours of all we can eat; 2 hours for <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> the price would have been
better for me..  BUT we got to have grilled bananas with cinamon, so
yeah that was pretty good.</p>

<p>Talked to Sebastian, Tim, Mi-chan, Sayori.  Sayori got progressively
intoxicated and entertaining, though it may have worn out after much
longer.  Funny that after we all got up to leave, her group took off
before everyone was out of the restaurant.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to eat in Kawasaki at my favorite Chinese restaurant.</p>

<p>##20:28pm</p>

<p>yay!  My favorite waitress was there!  She&rsquo;s the one who, on my
birthday when I asked 誕生日チュは？ exclaimed &ldquo;ヤダ！&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to quit writing down what I eat.  It takes up to much room
and doesn&rsquo;t do much good.  1st Period - I wrote an outline for my
research paper and I turned in a thesis statement.  Miss Carter wrote
it (thesis) though.  2nd we graded tests.  Donald Martin graded mine.
I got a 47 on it but he wrote it so it looked like a 97.  That&rsquo;s
pretty neat I think.  I just hope Mrs. Roach doesn&rsquo;t notice.  3rd- (physics) we
took a test.  We got back a previous test.  I got a 94 on the previous
one.  Also on the previous one I solved the bonus and <em>no one</em>
else did.  We had to show that the earth receives 1/(2 billionth) of
the sun&rsquo;s energy&hellip; given the radius of the earth and the radius of
earth&rsquo;s orbit.  Pretty good!  4th. We turned in our extra credit
stories.  I stayed up &lsquo;till 2:30 last&hellip; nevermind it&rsquo;s already
recorded up there.  5th Nothin&rsquo; great 6th. Mr Reagh told us his theory
of how mathematics should be taught.  Kids should have no formal
schooling in math until 6th or 7th grade.  At that point they should
be given algebra.  Ultimately they would be 2 years ahead of
normal. 4:05</p></p>

<p>I had 2 bowls of Crispix for breakfast.  For lunch, I had a roll,
tea, and pizza and veggie sticks.  For a snack I had a piece of cake,
milk, slice of meat, and graham crackers.  1st pd.  Library.  I worked
on my paper more. 2nd I failed a test.  I have about a 50 in there.
3rd. We found out what is on our test tomorrow.  4th Oral grades.  I
got 18 out of 20. 5th Some jobs and a Timed Writing  6th.  Went over
test I got a progress report.  Today I found out that Christina's mom
is mad at her because we've only "been out" twice.  I swear her mom is
dumber than Christina.  It used to be that we were getting too
serious. What does she want??? Yesterday Christina gave me a matching
pen and pencil. They are nice, but the pen writes blue and the
pencil's lead is too big.  Today she gave me a list of 200 song
titles.  I don't know why.  I gave Charmain her "Beastie Boys" tape
back.  I borrowed it to copy it, but I didn't copy it. 4:15PM</p>
