      <description>18:21 Sunday 23 December 2018 JST Lin and I joined her sister and sister&amp;rsquo;s daughter for a circuit of IKEA and then buffet. I put rechargable batteries into the cart but tried to slow down the rate of other items coming into the cart. Lin wants to buy a new light but did not measure the existing space to know how low a new light could hang.</description>

      <description>09:02 Thursday 22 February 2018 JST Yeah so last night against my better judgement, I ate at night. I mean it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a ton, but maybe 1&amp;frasl;2 kg, including a bunch of sugar.
This morning my stomach is like &amp;ldquo;ugh with a big fat ball of fat&amp;rdquo;
Lin felt about the same, so I made a contract with her to not eat after 9pm, 32 times in the next 38 days.</description>

      <description>18:09 Saturday 21 October 2017 JST Good time at Gekko, though a bit expensive overall. 4500 yen for 3 hours of all we can eat; 2 hours for 2&amp;frasl;3 the price would have been better for me.. BUT we got to have grilled bananas with cinamon, so yeah that was pretty good.
Talked to Sebastian, Tim, Mi-chan, Sayori. Sayori got progressively intoxicated and entertaining, though it may have worn out after much longer.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m going to quit writing down what I eat. It takes up to much room and doesn&amp;rsquo;t do much good. 1st Period - I wrote an outline for my research paper and I turned in a thesis statement. Miss Carter wrote it (thesis) though. 2nd we graded tests. Donald Martin graded mine. I got a 47 on it but he wrote it so it looked like a 97.</description>
