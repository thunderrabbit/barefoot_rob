                        <p class=date>Saturday 25 October 1997</p>

<p><p>
This day the LRY helped the Schweitzer Club with building their haunted house for the younger kids at church! Normally this project belongs to the Schweitzer Club, but they have only a few members this year and asked for our help.
<p>
My task included bringing big boxes for building whatever they wanted to build. Wende had brought a large box from work a few days previously, which stood grandly in our living room until Saturday morning.<br>
In the past, we&rsquo;ve been able to find tons of boxes at her work, but not this day. Almost all the boxes were smushed and bailed for recycling.  Doh!! There were a couple of long panels of cardboard, so we grabbed those. We also grabbed one big huge thick box that probably wasn&rsquo;t meant to be recycled just yet.
<p>
Wende stayed at work cause she had to work, and I drove our box collection back home to get everything else ready for the day.
<p>
As I was sending <a href="/writing/old/fgnet/index.html">The Feel Good Net</a>, Jon W called and indicated he hadn&rsquo;t gotten quite as much completed with the Construct-O-Con Registration forms as he wanted.
<p>
No problem! We went to Kinko&rsquo;s with what he had completed, and totally blatantly used the OKC Rally Registration form as our form. We got the whole thing completed and all good in about 25 minutes.  Awesome.
<p>
Drove to the church, and in a huge collision of cardboard, 3 mil plastic, staple guns, weird lights and youth, they built a haunted house.
<p>
The greatest part is the youth design it, the youth direct the creation, the youth are in charge of their own project! I got to crawl inside a big box and simply watch it unfold.
<p>
At around 5 or 6 in the pm, the haunted house was declared complete. We chilled and chilled for a while, waiting for a couple youth to return from whatever they had to do, and decided what to do the rest of the night.
<p>
Finally, it was Sarah L, Paul R, Laura M, Adam W, Wende and I who went to 59 Diner to munch before we cruised out to The Haunted Hotel. Unfortunately, Laura began to feel blechy and had to call her parental units to come pick her up. I finished my Diner Salad and went outside with her to wait. We intended good health for her, and hoped she&rsquo;d be able to come see us at church the next day.
<p>
The rest of us drove to Haunted Hotel, but the line was like 5 million people and we were all &ldquo;no way!&rdquo; and rented <em>The Exorcist</em> instead.
<p>
We got back to the church around 11pm. Sarah had to leave and kT joined us to watch the movie and spend the night. So at this point it was me, Wende, Paul, Adam and kT.
<p>
Paul and Adam watched the movie. I watched it mostly from such an oblique angle that the image was all distorted and really didn&rsquo;t seem quite as scary. kT kinda watched and kinda bounced around the room on warm Dr Pepper energy. Wende did not watch, instead spent her time making bead bracelets.
<p>
kT and I each made a bracelet for one another. I made her a green one and she made me a blue one. I love it.
<p>
Then at 2am (or is it 1am because we set the clock back?) we crashed for the night.

<p><p>
Wende and I went to Taco Cabana for our Weekly LRY Hangout thingy. I was amazed that we made it on time; Wende had been in College Station about an hour previously. She said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t exactly get here legally.&rdquo;
<p>
Paul R arrived essentially on time and we waited for a few minutes for any stragglers. We talked physics and about the Mars Sojourner and the Mars Sample Return programs.
<p>
Wende got more involved with the conversation once kT and Dennis arrived, talking about school and French III classes and all kinds of fun stuff.
<p>
At some point, Dennis said something really funny and kT snarfed her tasty beverage. Conversation turned to various snarf stories, and I think snarfing warm orange juice was the worst. (Who would drink warm orange juice in the first place??? (Apparently Dennis))
<p>
The goal quickly became &ldquo;who can make kT snarf again?&rdquo; and we all started getting silly silly.  Dennis made a crown out of his cup, but it wouldn&rsquo;t stay on his puffy hair. (It wouldn&rsquo;t stay on my lack of hair either&hellip;) Dennis started throwing bits of tortilla, and I made a tortilla mask out of mine.
<p>
Once the silliness sobered up, kT went to use the phone. I put my tortilla mask in her jacket pocket, which seemed appropriate since conversation had turned to pocket watches. Why not pocket tortillas??
<p>
As far as I know, she didn&rsquo;t figure it out until after we all left. Heh.
<p></p>

This night Jon W and I went to the Board meeting at church to request permission to hold the Houston Rally at Emerson Church this year (well, January 1998). I let Jon do essentially all the talking and he did great and we got it!
<p>
Pam B said &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; before he even finished asking the request; she helped the rest of the members understand the value of the event.
<p>
After we left, Jon and I talked for easily an hour about spirituality: Allies, god, Pleiadians, Mayans, the end of the 3D world, and about awareness techniques: lucid dreaming, opening one&rsquo;s third eye, meditation, and astral projection.
<p>
&ldquo;I see my hands, therefore I am dreaming.&rdquo;

Today at work I talked with Marc Loustau of the youth office, and he more fully described to me the ConCon staff position for which he had encouraged me to apply.
<p>
Turns out the position is not just advisor, but adult coordinator, the one and only adult who acts as advisor for all the other adult advisors. (Does that make sense?)<br />
<p>
It makes sense to me, and I feel greatly excited about the possibility of holding that position.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Also while at work I got some of the details worked out for getting youth to San Antonio Rally. We&rsquo;re going to have a fabulous time!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
After work, Wende and I went to La Jaliscience, the local inexpensive and quite tasty Mexican restaurant for dinner. I had a chicken burrito. Wende had a beef fajita burrito. Yumm-eee!

Last night Wende and I went to CiCi&rsquo;s Pizza, and invited our youth group to join just for fun.  Laura was there promptly at 7.  We talked about school and her trips to Disney World and stuff.  Actually Wende had more to say than I; I&rsquo;ve never been to Disney World.  <em>sniff!</em>
<p>
I encouraged Laura to get involved with Houston Rally planning, telling her how awesome the experience has been for many youth.
<p>
Today I have finally gotten caught up with my journal entries.

<p>
Today at church, the youth group got some great plans underway for this year&rsquo;s activities.  First on our calendar is planning for a church-wide fund raising (for Unicef) Talent Show!
<p>
I absolutely love how the youth are brainstorming, planning, organizing all their own activities. Wende and I are just there to help guide them but let them pretty much do their own thing.
<p>
Next planned thing (which will actually occur before the talent show) is a lock-in / haunted house creating day on the weekend of the 26 of October. We&rsquo;ll come in early on Saturday and help the younger kids build their haunted house. Once we&rsquo;re done and they&rsquo;re gone, we&rsquo;ll go to a professional haunted house and then come back and play and whatever until Sunday morning.
<p>
Sunday morning we&rsquo;ll help run the kids&rsquo; haunted house or whatever. Should be great fun.

                        <p class=date>29 September 1997</p>

<p><p>
This past weekend I met with the rest of the district YAC and Marc Loustau for our Summit pre-planning meeting. We completed all our goals and had a great time to boot. Marc&rsquo;s knowledge and experience proved to be a great asset to our cause.
<p>
We met at Horizon Church in Carrollton, TX. Jason Fricke and I drove up there together. Well, I drove, and he offered to drive anytime I got tired. Heh. He played some of his CDs, indoctrinating me in various forms of punk rock, from ska to 3rd wave ska, and 3rd wave punk, and some old school punk. I enjoy learning all the terminology.. I wonder if I&rsquo;ve got it right. ;)
<p>
I called Annette, our contact person with the key to the church as we passed the exit to Mars, south of Dallas. I told her that some of the youth were probably gonna be there soon, or may already be there, so she left her house to meet us at the church with the key.
<p>
The high-energy rally-induced excitement filled the church as we greeted everyone with hugs and happy energy. And it wasn&rsquo;t even a rally!
<p>&ldquo;Tia! I brought all my nine inch nails CDs!&rdquo;  We had wanted to compare collections for quite a while. (Our collection of Halos is pretty much the same, although she has an import version of halo four, and I have the mini disc version of halo five. She had several more bootlegs than I do, but we have a couple bootlegs in common.)
<p>
&ldquo;Bryan! I brought Vanilla Ice!&rdquo; For some crazy reason, we both love beatboxin&rsquo; &ldquo;Havin&rsquo; a Roni&rdquo; from this CD. We did it for the talent show at SWUUSI, and Arlene (I think) brought a picture from that night.
<p>
Once crazy happy energies had stablized, I left for DFW airport to pick up Marc Loustau from the youth office, and Tera Little, who flew in from Arkansas. DFW is <em>huge</em>!! There is an 8 lane highway that flows between all the terminals with enormous signs indicating arrival flights and times. It&rsquo;s well labeled; I was able to drive straight to where Tera and Marc had just walked outside to meet me. I didn&rsquo;t see them, though, but I heard &lsquo;em.
&ldquo;ROB!!&rdquo; I stopped and looked back and yay Marc and Tera!
<p>
They tossed their junk in the back of the truck and off we went back to the church. I mis-anticipated the direction I would have to turn to go back north, so &ldquo;whuups!&rdquo; as I halted traffic for a bit to drive across a lane of traffic and a curb to get to where we needed to be.
<p>
Marc was all, &ldquo;!!!  well, I guess this is a truck!&rdquo; They must not have pickup trucks in Boston.
<p>
Tera and Marc mostly just talkity talked the whole way to the church, where the youth bounced up to greet us as we arrived.
Big hugs were given all around, and everyone finally met Marc who we&rsquo;ve been expecting since early September or so.
<p>
That first night we just played and ate pizza that someone ordered.
<p>Tera, Melissa and I went to get groceries for the weekend. Coolest things there were stickers advertising Melissa Brand squash of various types. I asked the manager dude if he had some extra stickers in the back. He did not, but said I could take a couple off the squash. I grabbed one off the spaghetti squash, and the brightly colored turban squash.
I thought it was great fun to get the manager to look for stickers for me!
<p>
Oh, and I tossed two 12-packs and a 2-liter of SURGE into the cart. Yum.
<p>
At midnight or so, after Arlene and Aaron arrived, we had a worship led by Marc and Austin. We started by each lighting a candle and bringing to the group the skills and/or energy of one person who was not present. Then we each wrote on paper our goals for the weekend, and drew a visualization of two of the goals. Then we had a hand creme finger orgy: <br>
<blockquote>eyes closed, everyone reaches into the middle of the circle and grabs someone else&rsquo;s hand. Then turn palms up and Marc dribbled hand lotion onto our palms. We wiggled and squirmed our fingers together for what seemed like several minutes with our eyes closed. That was a cool worship activity I had never done before.
</blockquote>
<p>
After that we mostly just stayed up and talked until people crashed asleep between 2:30 and 4am.
<p>
At 8am I woke up. Melissa was already awake; we went outside to share the bright sunshine and cool dew covered grass. I only remember talkin&rsquo; about her minister, but I don&rsquo;t really remember what about.
<p>
People started waking up and we got to work around 10am I think. We looked through all the bylaws of other districts, took the best parts from each of those and broke up into small groups and just got a lot of shit done. We played frisbee and took quick energy breaks to get blood pumping again, but mostly we worked diligently. I won&rsquo;t bore you with details, but the work was quite effective and rewarding.<br>
The funniest energy break started with the group in a circle with your left hand facing up toward the person on your left and your right hand facing down on the person-to-your-right&rsquo;s up turned palm.
Then your right hand makes a circular motion, first clapping against their palm, both of your own thighs, the bottom of your own hand then the top of your hand twice. This clapping made up a six beat human metronome as Marc began singing the words to Edelweise (sp).  But the <em>funniest!!!</em> thing was that Jason simply started clapping and snapping and then movin&rsquo; and groovin&rsquo; dancin&rsquo; a crazy dance as I laffed my ass off watching him and most everyone else hummed the words that we didn&rsquo;t know. Jason stopped when Marc stopped singing, &ldquo;c&rsquo;mon everyone sing!&rdquo; and we were like, &ldquo;we donno the words!&rdquo; and Marc started again and Jason immediately danced even crazier! I couldn&rsquo;t stop laffin&rsquo; he was so fuckin&rsquo; hilarious!!
<p>
We went to dinner at Arby&rsquo;s (cause we couldn&rsquo;t find anything better and the Frosty machine was broken at Wendy&rsquo;s) and then hung out in the back of the truck in Arby&rsquo;s parking lot for about 20 or 30 minutes. Crazy fun. Bryan Beck and I beatboxed and traded lines from DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince; Jason and I play fought while I stood on the side of the truck bed; everyone had a fun time just relaxing and stuff.
<p>
Back to work at the church we went, broke up into groups and got even more stuff done than we had expected to the entire weekend.
We were not quite as focused this time and by about midnight, some were getting kinda fiesty and gripey, but we were still struggling to get more finished.
<p>
Marc interjected: &ldquo;You guys have accomplished so much this weekend. Do you realize that we achieved all our goals before we went to dinner? You have grown together and bonded as a group like I&rsquo;ve never seen before. I suggest that we wrap it up for the night.&rdquo;
<p>
We all agreed. Jason goes, &ldquo;how about Bish Bish??&rdquo; Several people including I said naw, and then we were like, &ldquo;wait&hellip; there is absolutely no one else in the church&hellip;..&rdquo;<br>
I haven&rsquo;t chanted Bish Bish (maybe once) in the more than a year I&rsquo;ve been advisor. That night I shouted it like never before. Wow that felt great!!! (If yer goin&rsquo; &ldquo;what is Bish Bish???&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll have to ask me via email.)
<p>
After we cleaned up, everyone except Jason and Austin played Silent Football outside on the lawn. Marc was Dictator and he gave quite a different flavor to the game. Different motions and names and nearly random penance points awardance and it was crazy. For example, he gave us all <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> penance point for essentially no reason in the middle of the game. He was quite talkity while people were tattling, and he awarded points before people had even tattled on something. We still had great fun. (If yer goin&rsquo; &ldquo;what is Silent Football???&rdquo; Go to my &ldquo;friends on the web&rdquo; page.)
<p>
I stayed up talking to Marc for about an hour or so until like 2am and then talked until 2:30am to the youth in the kitchen who were making rice crispy treats for Tera&rsquo;s birthday (yay Tera!)
<p>
Then I slept until 7:30 and woke up to my beeper alarm. I played &ldquo;wish&rdquo; by nine inch nails really loud to get blood moving as we cleaned and stuff. After we had all cleaned up, most of us went in search of breakfast.
<p>
We ended up at McDonald&rsquo;s cause it was the only place open that early in the morning. The great thing was that Arlene climbed up the spiral tube of the indoor playground thing! We waved like proud parents to her crouched in the little room at the top, and then most of the youth climbed through it too. I actually did not; I was eating my salad and by the time I was done, some little kids were playing on it.
<p>
To the airport Tera and I drove with Jason and Marc sleepin&rsquo; in the back of the truck. I&rsquo;m glad they were sleepin&rsquo; because a cop was driving behind us for a couple miles. Eeeps!<br>
I stopped at the departure place corresponding to where I had picked up Marc and Tera 36 hours earlier. Big hugs were given and we looked forward to seeing everyone again at Little Rock Rally in December.
<p>
Jason and I drove home, engaging discussions on flag burning, abortion, drug use, and various genres of punk rock. As we were driving through Houston area, conversation turned to rock climbing and roller coasters and twisty flippy turning rides commonly seen in parking lot traveling fairs.
<p>
I said HI to Jason&rsquo;s mom and was too tired to figure out a problem she was having with a printer error she had on her computer. I went home and slept from 5pm till 7:30 am this morning.

<p>
I&rsquo;m not totally sure what I&rsquo;m doing with this webpage; it&rsquo;s
been idle for a while.  I haven&rsquo;t been working on my novel, or writing Wild Skating Adventures, or out of body adventures, or
much of anything.
<p>
So what <em>have</em> I been doing?
<p>
I&rsquo;ve been working at work as a professional programmer, but that is not what I want to do all my life.  (More on that in a second)
<p>
I&rsquo;ve been an advisor for high school youth in my district. I love it. The work is absolutely rewarding; it&rsquo;s the one part of my life where I feel like I&rsquo;m actually making a difference in the world. The youth love me and I do everything in my power to help  their spiritual, emotional, physical growth. I love them all dearly.
<p>
This weekend the YAC members are meeting at Horizon Church in Carrolton, Texas.  We are planning for our Summit meeting in mid-October. This is the first lock-in this new YAC has experienced; I expect it to be quite fun and productive.
<p>
Jason Fricke and I are driving up from Houston tomorrow, picking up the key to the church from my friend Carrie Bruce and then I&rsquo;ll drop off Jason at the church so we can let everyone (who has  arrived) in. I&rsquo;ll go to DFW airport where I&rsquo;ll pick up Marc Lousteau and Tera Little. Then back to the church and the weekend begins. Yay!
<p>
Right now as I type this at work, I am listening to nine inch nails remix version of &ldquo;perfect drug&rdquo; as loud as my little CDRom headphones will let me. Nice, but I would like it louder.

SWUUSI 1997 by Rob<br />
</p>
<p>
26 July 1997
<p>
Drove up here after Bobby, Erika, and Nathan drove to Houston and spent the night at our apartment.  Altogether we had Me, Jason Fricke, Mike Noyse, Bobby Hall, Erika Hewitt, and Nathan Ryan.
<p>Stopped a couple times along the way and Nathan needed a white t-shirt, so we stopped in at Albertson&rsquo;s in Denton.  Found a package that was open, so we got two shirts for two bucks. Cool.
<p>Drove drove drove and then over a hill and wow- beautiful Lake Texoma longer wide than we could see. It has been 10 years since I crossed this bridge to get to SWUUSI back in my halcyon days of YRUUdom. 10 years! And the memories flooded back.  I have to totally
go see where we used to hang out..  The Point,  where Karina and I made a pile of rocks using only our feet until it was tall enough to reach out of the shallow water. Bayview Lodge, where we piled everyone into 2 beds, made potato print t-shirts, ..  everything.
<p>But not this year.  This year our biological nature station thing is nestled beautifully in the trees overlooking the lake. Breathtaking!!!  We need to get a poet up here!
<p>We fell out of the cars like puppies, excited to greet our new home for a week.  We hugged Andy Andrews, Amanda Hovland, Daniel Polk.   Wow wow wow!!!!   First thing we went for a walk down the asphalt drive down to the boat docks.  First thing I
noticed on the way down is that the asphalt was HOT.  Hot hot hot hot hot.  Amanda pointed out that I wasn&rsquo;t wearing shoes.   Hmmmm.
<p>I went out the rocky peninsula as the rest of em went into the covered boat dock area.  We tossed the frisbee back and forth between me and them, taunting the wind to blow the frisbee into the water.  Close- but we were able to get it out with a stick.
<p>
And then up to the rooms!!  Amazing with couches and desks and bunk beds and air conditioning and separate fridge and a door to the patio out back!!
<hr><p>
We just had the SWUUSI planning meeting.  Wonderful to watch the youth deliberate and determine the rules that were appropriate, allowing freedom for fun, safety from danger and stuff.
<p>
I grabbed my pizza colored dogbone pillow as I lay on the floor looking at many pictures taken by Arlene Dormio from the New Orleans Rally.  Lots of fun memories from there.
<p>Now it&rsquo;s dinnertime.</p><p>
After a wonderful dinner (where I had to wear shoes) we decided to swim.  I got my trunks on, and went running with frisbee toward the lake.  I threw it into the wind and caught it a couple of times and then I realized I had lost my toe ring!  Doh!!<br>
So I walked carefully searching the ground for where I had been running and did not find it.  Jason, Andy and Dane helped.  After not too long, Dane found it.  Yay Dane!!  It had split at the seam; I&rsquo;ll have to get it re-soldered when we get back.
<p>Walked toward the beach and   <b><b>OW!!</b></b> big cockleburs had stabbed deeply into my foot.  Dang dang dangit!! Dane helped me pull them out, and then carried me on his back to the lake.  Then, much to my (almost) surprise, ran straight into the water without regard to his jeans or shirt or wallet (or my
shirt)..    The water is orgasmically fabulously, astonishingly wonderfully warm.   Awww  yeah warmer than a bath!  Well, as warm as a bath.  Incredible.<br />
<p>In our warm wonderful bath, we splashed around, played mar<br>c</br>o polo, had chicken fights, had non-chicken fights, waved to a jet skiier, and just had a great time.  The best silly fun for me was when we found some tires half buried in the bottom of the lake and Jason and I played King of the Tire.  That was
cool.  Bryan Beck and Dane Dormio joined after we played for a while and we goofed around, pushing each other off the tires, while trying to stay balanced.<br />
<p>The sun went down, and we decided to get out.  I left my shirt spread out over the rocky shore, hoping it will be dry when I get it tomorrow.<br />
<p>Mike Noyse walked up to me and was all, &ldquo;check this out.   Here hold this in your left hand near your chest.&rdquo;  He handed me an orange.  &ldquo;Okay hold out your right arm.&rdquo;   I did this and he pushed down on my right arm.  It didn&rsquo;t go down very far.    &ldquo;Okay, now hold this in your left hand near your chest.&rdquo;  He handed me a cigarette.  Ewww!  Then he pushed down on my right arm and it went way far down. Well that&rsquo;s just cause I was grossed out by the cigarette.  Or was it?
<p>I went outside to find the other advisors and show them this new experiment.  They were already doing it. We attempted to make it more scientific by making the item holder close his or her eyes and having them hold items of equal feel but different healthy-factors. Nothing was proven, but it&rsquo;s certainly an interesting concept.
<p>We are practically out in the middle of nowhere.   This is incredible.
<p>It&rsquo;s now 2:00am Sunday..<br />
<p>We had our YAC meeting, our first one as the &ldquo;new&rdquo; YAC.   We planned to plan our budget, planned some of our plans for the year, and it was generally a productive meeting.<br />
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to Wednesday morning, when I&rsquo;ll present the bead workshop. That will rule. And then Thursday morning when we discuss the most important thing in the world.<br />
<p>So- right now we&rsquo;re planning our budget.  And just now I had some fun 2am humor:
<p>Arlene:  &ldquo;Where should we have our YAC retreat?&rdquo;<br>Rob: &ldquo;What would really be cool is we could go camping  set up the tent, be cookin&rsquo; some beans over the fire..&rdquo;<br> Arlene:&ldquo;I think we would spend more time camping than meeting- just trying to survive.&rdquo;<br>Rob:&ldquo;&lsquo;Ohmygod there&rsquo;s a bear!  I move that we adjourn the meeting!&rsquo;   &lsquo; I second!!&rsquo;  &lsquo;All in favor??&rsquo;   Aaaiiiiieeeeee!!!!</p>
<p>After we were done budget planning, Bryan Beck, Melissa Cain and I walked outside just to see what we could see.  The sky was not as spectacularly starry as we had expected, but it was still beautiful.  As our eyes got more adjusted to the dark, we could see the arm of the Milky Way stretching over us.   Awesome.  Awesome enough that I ran and got my sleeping bag and we spent a couple hours talking and stargazing.  Before it began to get light, I was falling asleep and they kept on talkin&rsquo;.   As it began to get light, I was fully asleep and they decided to continue their conversation elsewhere.  I woke up this morning at like 7am.
<p>Slept from 7:20 till breakfast, ate breakfast and then we were on the scramble to get the YAC response to a letter sent to the district board about the YAC.  Bryan typed the thing on my computer, then I realized I didn&rsquo;t have a floppy drive on my machine.  So he retyped it on Arlene&rsquo;s computer and we copied it to disk, drove to the main camp, but had no printer with which to print it.  We helped Connie Nolen set up her computer, but she didn&rsquo;t have software that could read the format.  We finally found Ann Jacobson&rsquo;s computer and set it up and YAY!! And we printed it and found an extra copy of the bylaws and got everything signed and copied and at exactly 3pm and had to borrow the stapler from the front desk and Tia and Jeremy zipped up to Room 229 and wow.  Done.  At least my end was done.<br />
<p>Bryan Beck, Kristian Captain Shallin Kazoo Kris Scott, and I drove back to the Biological Research Center and here we are! Youth are arriving and the energy level is spiraling up and up.
<p> John Thompson from Fatetteville and I decided to go swimming.  We asked if anyone else wanted to go, and soon ended up with a group of about 10 people to go swim. Swimming were (I don&rsquo;t know last names yet) Abe from California, Emily, Lindsey, Nicole Catrette, Mike Moren, Rob Nugen (me), Scott, John, Maggie, and one other dude whose name I have forgotten.
<p>When I got to the beach, I was thrilled to see rocks carefully placed on my shirt, which I had left to dry the previous night.  They  spelled, &ldquo;HI Rob&rdquo; and then had a smiley face at the bottom.  The people here are so wonderful!!
<p>Everyone slowly made it into the water and we mostly kinda floated around until we did a couple chicken fights, then tried a couple of rounds of the knot game.  The freakiest thing was that minnows started to nibble nibble nibble our backs and it was tickly to me but unbearable to some.  Pretty funny, I thought.
<p>Then we played marco polo. We played until several  people got bored and got out and then everyone else got out until it was just me standing in ankle deep water leading Mike &ldquo;Marco Forever&rdquo; Moren out of the lake.
<p>I chilled on the beach for a second to relax and then went to pick up my shirt.   I didn&rsquo;t think to take a picture of the &ldquo;HI Rob,&rdquo; but I will always remember it in my heart.   Thank you.
<p>Dinner was dynamic now with 70 crazy bodies instead of only 10.   And then the first timers meeting full of jokes about &ldquo;Debe&rsquo;s gonna take you down!&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Debe couldn&rsquo;t take an elevator down!!&rdquo;
<p>Then Opening circle, which went quite well, outside on the basketball court by the pavilion.
<p>Then touch groups.  I&rsquo;m in Aaron Ivener&rsquo;s group, along with Keith Lawlor, who recently went to the Pavement concert, Riley from Arkansas, whose town is smaller in population than this conference, Frank Roesler from OKC, who I don&rsquo;t remember what, and Eric Morrow, also from OKC, who just got a car and drove to SWUUSI this year (and got lost).
<p>After touch groups, Dane and Bryan were walkin&rsquo; down the hall with clippers, planning to cut Bryan&rsquo;s hair.
<p>Hmmmm.   I buzzed my hair using the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; guard on Friday before SWUUSI.  I buzzed my hair using no guard tonight.  It is short.  Feels like velvet.  I love it.
<p>Now it&rsquo;s 10:30pm and I&rsquo;ll be an Awake, Aware Alert Advisor until 5am.
<p>Wow- so my hair has been growing for 6.5 hours now..  The coolest things I did were laying out in the field with several youths, watching the stars, and the other was listening to Kris, Aaron, Daniel, and Susanne all play guitar.  What a fabulous source of love and positive joyful energy!!!
<p>I just now walked in from outside and nine inch nails &ldquo;burn&rdquo; was on the CD player.  I cranked it up and let the music grind into my skull for the last 5 minutes of my AAAA duty.
<p>Peace out, G.  It&rsquo;s 5am Monday.   I&rsquo;m going to sleep or going to shave my head all the way.  Don&rsquo;t know which.
<p>2:40pm Monday.  I shaved my head all the way.  Bald.  I did it myself with Bobby&rsquo;s disposable razor.  It&rsquo;s quite an interesting experience.   It doesn&rsquo;t look all that different, but it sure feels different.  I totally loved it, though I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d be comfortable like this all the time.    I got a couple pictures taken of me last night then I slept for a few hours and then had breakfast.
<p>During breakfast, a memorandum was passed out to the various tables.  Full of grammatical errors, it reminded us that foul language is not appropriate, &ldquo;specifically the m.f. word overheard last night&rdquo;<br />
<p>Hilarious in some ways, the letter made it into the Big White Rally Book.  However, we want greatly to respect the facilities and their rules, so we&rsquo;ll watch our language..
<p>Then was Jenny Weils&rsquo; time to speak as our theme speaker on spirituality and some other stuff.  It was wonderful. We did a couple of exercises, including a check in, where you tell your name and then give yourself a more immediately appropriate name.  Another exercise we did was get into pairs of people and one person says, &ldquo;I <blah blah blah>&rdquo; and the other person after each sentence says simply, &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo;  This exercise went for about 3 minutes.  It&rsquo;s really hard to tell someone about only yourself for that long!
<p>I mentioned something about how people like to talk &ldquo;about themselves&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s not really about themselves, as this exercise required.<br />
<p>Jenny said, &ldquo;yes- people like to talk about things that are right beside themselves.&rdquo;
<p>Then we kinda talked about what we&rsquo;ll discuss for the rest of the week.<br />
<p>After the spirituality workshop, we molded Fimo, various colors of claylike stuff that you can bake so it retains its shape.  I made a flaming chalice shape with peace symbol colors.<br />
<p>We played with the Ballzak at the swimming beach thing a couple of times.  That&rsquo;s pretty fun.  Mostly we tried to just volley it and keep it from hitting the water.  Erika and I found that it will skip across the water quite nicely if you bounce it with just the right amount of backwards spin.<br />
<p>After dinner, I was walkin&rsquo; around taking pictures.  The funniest ones were of Tiffany, Suzanne, Sarah, and Maggie catching soap bubbles on their tongues.  Then they played a game of improv tag, which I joined for a bit until it was time for the special event.  At one point, one of them was on the ground, so I froze it and took her place.  I re-did a scene from Houston Rally 1986, which Shawn McDaniel did with me.  I said, &ldquo;mom, I want to get a job as a speed bump.&rdquo;  She wouldn&rsquo;t let me, so I complained, &ldquo;you never let me do what I want!  You always said I should get a job doing something I love, and I love to lie down!&rdquo;
<p>She proceeded to show me what it would be like and tried to drive over me.  I was laying there yelling, when the scene got frozen again.  Sarah took her place and now suddenly I was birthing a baby!  I kept yelling and she reminded me to breathe so I did my Lamaz breathing and couldn&rsquo;t take the pain, so I (gently) grabbed her hair and yelled, &ldquo;I want morphine!!&rdquo;  She gave me an injection to the skull and I began to float around, gently cooing and singing..   We were frozen, and someone took my place and turned it into a ballet.  Soon, one of them missed a cue and fell to the ground or something, so I became the director, yelling, &ldquo;cut!  Cut!  It&rsquo;s time for the special event!!&rdquo;
<p>The special event was Casino Night!  This time with pixie sticks as currency, there was the roulette wheel used at Houston Rally 1997, two craps tables and two poker tables.   I quickly lost all my money at roulette and craps, and I even laundered some empty pixie sticks.<br />
<p>I took several pictures, and then was asked to run a craps table.  I was a bit overwhelmed by all the bets that were being placed, &ldquo;$100 on odd!&rdquo;  &ldquo;200 on even!&rdquo;  &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll roll an eight!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Odd!&rdquo; so I just started calling, &ldquo;if you lose, slide &lsquo;em in, hold &lsquo;em up if you win!&rdquo;  That seemed to work just fine.
<p>My bank had great fluctuations in value, but ended up with lots of cash.  The betting was ended and the auction began! I embezzled the bank I had been working, and waited until Jason held up the gumball machine.  &ldquo;$1000!&rdquo; &ldquo;$1500!&rdquo;   &ldquo;$3000!&rdquo;  &ldquo;$5000!!&rdquo;  Then I called, &ldquo;Sixty Nine Thousand Dollars!!!&rdquo; Jason hollered something like, &ldquo;Rob!!  You stole that!&rdquo;  So I ran up toward the booth and then out the door, just being silly.  I walked back in after a second and turned in my loot. The rest of the auctioning was full of excitement and fun.  I enjoyed watching everyone have a great time. At the end, all the pixie sticks were thrown into the crowd.  Yay!!!
<p>My hair feels like 80 grit sandpaper.
<hr>
<p>Now I am at home.  Today is Sunday, a couple of days after SWUUSI, and all I have are a few sparse notes and wonderful memories.
<p>I attended the Worship Workshop, where we designed the worship for Wednesday night, I believe.  Most of the ideas we used were given by Tiffany Schneider.  I gave essentially zero ideas, but just pointed out a couple of possible problems that they may encounter.
<p>Outside, I took my frisbee and began to toss it way into the air and catch it myself.  Soon a few youth joined me and we played catch for a while.  I got to give a few pointers on how to throw.  At some point, I got to make several throws to John Thompson and Chris Cusak.  These were fun throws because John and Chris wanted me to throw as far and as hard as possible so they could practice running, catching and everything. They did quite well.
<p>The Young Adults came that afternoon while several of us were in a great game of Ultimate (frisbee).  It&rsquo;s one of my favorite games in the whole world!  Paul, who had just arrived with the young adults, joined us.<br />
<p>Everyone played hard and had a great time.  At the end, we were all <em>totally</em> sweaty and tired. Unfortunately, there were 3 injuries during the game.  Frank Roesler re-injured a bruised bone in his foot (I think), I twisted my right ankle, and Scott Burrington twisted his left ankle.
<p>Despite my ankle, I went swimming, wanting the warm buoyancy to keep me off my foot.
<p>We swam until it began to get dark, pushing the limits of, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not dark yet!&rdquo; until it really was pretty dark and I realized one of the balls was floating    I swam after it and finally caught it.  By the time I got back toward shore, it was totally dark.  But I had recovered the ball.  Yay!
<p>The worship that night ruled.  This is the one that I watched in the planning stages.   The worship the previous night  hadn&rsquo;t been as great as it coulda been since people kept talking.  So we set the mood of this worship from the very beginning.  Everyone lined up in the hallway and were led toward the library in which all the lights were off except for a few candles.  As each individual entered, they were greeted with a hug and a piece of gum was placed into their mouth.   Everyone sat quietly in a circle until everyone else had entered and been seated.  The candles around the perimeter of the room were extinguished, and a chalice was lit in the center of the circle.  Tiffany read a wonderful poem she had written, describing matches and candles,  and then the next portion of the ceremony was presented.
<p>Each person approached the chalice and lit a small candle for someone (who may or may not be at SWUUSI),  and placed the candle in the sand around the chalice.  Then put their gum on a small plate beside the sand.  (Actually the plate was a lid to a peanut butter jar)    This process took way longer than expected.  However, everyone was silent during the entire ceremony.  Silent! (oops i mean silent)
It was incredible.  After everyone had lit their candle and placed their gum (except for myself who forgot to place my gum and swallowed it instead) a last candle was lit and stuck into the pile of gum, representing the entire community working together.
<p>Emotions were incredibly high.  As the worship ended, tears and hugs were everywhere.  About 15 people stayed and we endlessly sang &ldquo;we are a circle within a circle, with no beginning and never ending,&rdquo; arm in arm around the chalice, watching the candles burn.  A few people were there until every candle had burned completely out.   I understand the experience was unlike any other.
<p>That night I slept with ice on my ankle for several hours on a couch in the front room.
<p>The next morning, Jenny Weils 1.5 year old son joined us during the spirituality workshop.  If I remember correctly, Maggie, Sarah, Jordan and Amber took care of him during this time.  The workshop this day included a discussion on prayer.  What is prayer?  How is it different than meditation?  To who/what are we actually praying?  Does it matter who/what?  Does prayer actually work?<br />
<p>At noon that day I led the bead workshop.  We had about a million beads and about 10 youth and plenty of creativity.  I showed them how to make a simple daisy and then gave it to the first one who held out their hand (I think Jordan).  All variety of bead necklaces, bracelets, rings, etc were created mostly in silence.  It turned out to be a pretty good type of meditation for most.
<p>Soon, I had to leave with 4 youth members of YAC for a meeting with district boards members at the main lodge.  The meeting started as a get-to-know-ya meeting, but quickly turned into a let&rsquo;s-all-meet-and-rewrite-the-yruu-bylaws meeting.   The logic behind this is to keep the YAC from being turned down year after year by the SWUUC board.  If bylaws are designed by everyone who must approve them, then the approval should be much easier.  This seemed to be a good idea to most, and I was happy with it because the entire YAC is invited to this Summit.  The YAC Summit will be held in Austin 10-12 October 1997.  If you would like us to present any ideas, let YAC know by 12 September 1997.
<p>That night was the Lammas ceremony.  The coolest thing-as we were driving up to the site, I saw my mom walkin&rsquo; toward it!  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my mom!  Let me out!&rdquo;  So I hopped out of the car and walked with her to the site.  We briefly exchanged stories and ideas until the ceremony began.  I highly enjoyed talking to her as an  what an interesting experience!
<p>Karen Rinehart-Morgan, now in the young adults group joined us in the circle.  She and I hung out and sang out throughout the entire ceremony.  The circle was cast, and the entire group requested the power of the four directions/elements in turn.  We were nourished with bread and then performed the round and round wiggly crazy spiral dance hand in hand while endlessly chanting/singing &ldquo;we all come from the Goddess, and to her we shall return like a drop of rain, flowing to the ocean&rdquo; and &ldquo;hoof and horn hoof and horn, all that dies shall be reborn, corn and grain corn and grain, all that falls shall rise again.&rdquo;   Then we thanked all four directions/elements and the circle was opened but not broken and everyone laughed and hugged and talked and it was beautiful.
<p>A small fiasco was required to get all the youth into the vans/cars so we could go to our customary pancake place for wild and crazy pancake night!
<p>We entirely filled the pancake place.   Shortly after we arrived, I noted that some of my old rally buds were there!   I had just seen Shawn McDaniel at Ft Worth, so he wasn&rsquo;t too hard to recognize.  I remembered Joe Kast&rsquo;s name, but I couldn&rsquo;t think of Gail Keen&rsquo;s.   But isn&rsquo;t that amazing???   10 years ago we used to play!!!
<p>The waitstaff handled us fabulously well;  youth were almost bouncing off the walls after such an energy boost as Lammas.  I was equally nutty, and I mostly remember myself, Bryan Beck, Austin Roth, and maybe someone else going crazy  beat boxing out in the parking lot.  Bryan said that last year they got in trouble for being so loud.  We didn&rsquo;t  have that problem this year.
<p>I stayed up all night , high on sugar and love and happiness.   Soon after we got back, I put on  Beastie Boys on the CD player in the main living room area.  Several youth were alert but crashed on the couches, while some others were buzzing alert playing cards.  I danced my brains out to Beastie Boys and then put on much slower gentler Tori Amos and lay down to listen to her.
<p>Once I had recovered, I played the &ldquo;Set&rdquo; game, owned by Melissa Cain.  It&rsquo;s a pretty interesting/almost complex pattern matching game played with cards.  Once I figured out how to play (although not as well as the youth), I joined Charlotte Benbenek-Price, Marie Shallin, and Marsha Murphy (I think) in a long game of Egyptian Rat Screw.  We were silly!!   Actually, it was mostly Marie who was quite the silliest.  Charlotte and I shook our heads in amazement, while Marsha, being at her first YRUU anything, just kinda let it slide.
<p>During this game, I kept on saying &ldquo;Whassup Dog?&rdquo; or &ldquo;go, dog!&rdquo; or whatever, using the pronoun &ldquo;dog.&rdquo;  Charolette would reply, &ldquo;Cat?&rdquo; and then we&rsquo;d both say,  &ldquo;Swordfish?  Trilobite!!!&rdquo; with all the intensity that 5am humor can bring.  I can&rsquo;t begin to tell you how funny that was at 5am.
<p>At about 6 or 7am I went to bed for about 1.5 hours.
<p>This day, Thursday, after the final spirituality workshop with Jenny Weil, I went into the main room looking for anyone who wanted to participate in the discussion on The Most Important Thing in the World.
Dane Dormio, Tiffany Bush, and I think Laura Andrews and then Erika Hewitt, another advisor joined us.
More precisely, this was a discussion on &ldquo;What is the most important thing for humans to do in the world?&rdquo;
We wondered at first if there could in fact be a most important thing to do in the world.
Assuming there was, we determined it is something like being nice to people and having fun in life.
What I remember most is that Dane and I have almost exactly the same view of the universe, briefly, that each person is an aspect of God, learning about God&rsquo;s self.  As Dane was describing his view, I was amazed at how well it matched mine.<br />
The next most memorable thing was how astonished Erika became as I told her my version of Joe McMoneagle&rsquo;s near death experience.  Then after reading a portion of his book, Mind Trek,she was really amazed!  If you&rsquo;re interested, read the whole book; it&rsquo;s quite good.
<p>That night was the wild wacky wild crazy nutty zany talent show!  It started out tamely enough, with Adam Lock telling a really bad martian joke, and then me not telling the joke that begins, &ldquo;One day there was this . And he really loved clowns.&rdquo;   Instead, ck_scott and Aaron Ivener played some guitar song and then Dorthea Micklea danced with them to a cover of &ldquo;Groove is in the Heart&rdquo; by Deee Light.
Then something else and then the great Spam eating performance, and another something else and about the time that Frank Roesler did an improv version of  some song, and Bryan Beck and I performed our cover of  &ldquo;Havin&rsquo; a Roni&rdquo; by Vanilla Ice, the Groovy Juice kicked in and the whole place got crazy.
Next thing I remember is Willy Wagner, Daniel Kaminsky and Nathan Sexton performing as the 3 Headed Wonder, and then I think that&rsquo;s when Jason Fricke and Austin Roth(?) carried Bryan Beck, giggling uncontrollably, and dumped him on the stage.  Then Jason Fricke, Jeremy Loomis-Norris(?) and I each drank a third of a 2 liter of Surge and it was great.
Just as everyone thought the show was over, we advisors called them all back for the last performance, our version of &ldquo;Yogi Bear&rdquo;   Instead of each verse describing Yogi or one of his friends, each verse described one of the advisors!  Mine went something like, &ldquo;Rob thinks he&rsquo;s an adult, . Yeah, right&rdquo;
We had great fun.
<p>Then the YAC had a meeting, which proved somewhat difficult for our concentration, so we discussed a few issues and decided to move the rest to our next meeting.
<p>Then the last and most beautiful worship.  We started with an Angel Wash, where each person walks between two rows of people who use their hands and brush over the aura of the person walking through the line.  Then we sat in a circle and offered thoughts about the week.   I cried, listening to the incredible level of emotional sharing between the youth.  I was not alone; I could hear many sniffles throughout the room.  It was beautiful.
<p>Afterwards, many people stayed and hugged forever.  After probably 20 minutes of hugs all around, the several remaining people agreed that now would be a great time for a dance!
<p>Beastie Boys, that crazy Seasamee Street song (twice!) and tons of stuff until we were just soaked with sweat.  Then it was declared to be a great time to watch the videos John Thompson had candidly recorded during the week.  Most hilarious was stuff from the talent show.
<p>The movies began to get kinda long and not quite so entertaining, so I went to sleep.   It was probably 4:30 in the am.  I slept until about 7:30, ignoring the insanity that began at 6:30, starring Debe running through the hallways, banging a pot or something, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time to get up!!  Wake up and get your stuff packed!  We gotta have this place clean in 2 hours!!&rdquo;
<p>I meditated as I packed, remembering all the greatness of the week, making certain I packed everything I had brought.  I woulda forgotten my copy of Mind Trek, but it ended up on the lost and found ping-pong table.  I had given up on finding my SWUUSI shirt, but I got it back because when I first got it, I had immediately written my name on the tag.
<p>Many many many hugs were given all over the place.  We had a surprise for Julie Sexton when she came to pick up her son Nathan.  Everyone crowded between her and him, and we told her we had a surprise.  She told us to &ldquo;part like the Red Sea&rdquo; which is pretty ironic because, surprise!  Nathan not only had magenta hair, his whole torso was practically red.  This was a result of the tie dye workshop, through which I had slept.
<p>While we were waiting for parental units to arrive, someone called me over.  &ldquo;Hey, Rob-  who is your step sister?&rdquo;   I hugged Alicia Montgomery, much to their surprise.  It&rsquo;s true!!  The craziest part is that my dear rally friend Karina Montgomery (Alicia&rsquo;s half sister) and I knew each other way before our respective parents met and got married.<br />
<p>I waited until Alicia was picked up by her dad, and then Jason Fricke and I cruised.
<p>On the way home, Jason and I worked on YAC stuff.  We essentially proved that youth from the various churches must design the rallies, and Jason sketched out a structure of responsibility from YRUU up through YAC to the district board.  I think the idea will work wonderfully; it&rsquo;s quite ingenious.
<p>Also on the way home, we each ate about 30 pixie sticks.  Maybe more.  And when we stopped at Dairy Queen, I ate a medium M&amp;M Blizzard.  Lots of people were staring at us- buzz haircut, belt with studs, and white tank top.
<p>We both stayed awake the rest of the way home.  I had Jason teach me some lyrics to his favorite songs, and he taught me the difference between punk, ska and oi, his favorite musical genres.</p>

<p><p>What an incredible trip.</p>

<p><p>Until San Antonio,</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

</p>
<p>
SWUUSI hasn't even started, but I've already had a lot of fun.  After 
a relatively short trip, I got here at about 4:00 pm.  I came early 
because my mom's on staff.  There was a staff meeting going on when 
we arrived, but I passed the time talking with Nathan Ryan, who was 
in the same predicament as me.  In what seemed like no time at all 
the meeting was over, and the few of us who were here already went 
walking after a short lunch of roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy, 
peas and corn.  (otherwise known as "the first clash with the lunch 
ladies")  Rob and Jason threw a frisbee back and forth across a small 
part of the lake that juts in, and of course it ended up in the 
water, so Rob swam in to get it.  Later Rob lost his toe ring while 
running across some grass, and I saw him and Jason walking around 
looking for it.  I went to help, and following my instincts I found 
it in about two minutes.  Coincidence?  Then I piggy-backed 
bare-footed Rob across the burr-filled grass to save his feet, and 
dumped him and myself into beautiful lake Texoma.  I probably should 
have remembered to take my wallet and everything else out of my 
pockets before I jumped in fully clothed and shod.
</p>
<p>
The water was body temperature, perfect for an evening swim.  The 
lake is great, only two stone's-throws from the main building, but it 
seems longer if you happen to be carrying Jason Fricke on your back.  
And the main building is nice, too, although the game room has an 
annoying smell.  The grounds are nice, large and sprawling, or they 
seem that way to me, although I'm sure they will be cut down when the 
boundaries are enforced tomorrow.  We're in a nice, secluded spot, 
with lots of trees where I can hang my hammock.
</p>
<p>
Several of us  stayed in the water for a couple of hours, playing 
Marco Polo and Chicken and King of the Tire (a frustrating game), and 
waving and yelling at passing pontoons.  We all went in before it got 
dark and I have just been hanging out since then.  There's a YAC 
meeting going on right now, tying up most of the people, and I am in 
the oddly-scented room writing this.  Nancy Mauldin, Julie Sexton, 
Debe Barnes, and Emily Sessions are discussing plans and food, with 
occasional helpful comments from Nathan Ryan.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of food, I think we'll have to be careful in the cafeteria 
as best we can, because the cafeteria ladies were a little, um, 
disturbed today at lunch.  One of them asked one of the advisors if 
we were "troubled teens".  Isn't that a bit redundant?  Yes, of 
course.

Monday<br>

4:54 pm<br>

</p>
<p>
I just got done attending Debe's mud workshop, but I have no idea 
what went on because the air conditioner was so loud that I couldn't 
hear.
</p>
<p>
Last night kicked a lot of ass, but I should start writing where I 
left off last time.  Most of Saturday night and Sunday morning was 
spent in preparation, doing business stuff.  I waited around 
impatiently most of the time while everybody else worked, since I'm 
not on staff.  The first person to show up was Joanna Hessel, forty 
minutes early, and they flowed in pretty steadily after that, until 
everybody was here a couple of hours later.  The last one to arrive 
was Santiago Webber.  He got here earlier today.  This is pretty 
small for a group camp.  There are a total of around seventy people, 
I think seventy-three to be exact, including the advisors and Bryan 
and Tia, the co-deans.
</p>
<p>
The mood last night was joyous, and the activity  didn't stop all 
night.  The main event started when Bryan wanted to shave his head, 
and when we started to do that about six other people decided to do 
the same thing, so it turned into a grand fiasco.  Rob's hair had 
been freshly cut down to 1/8th of an inch, but I cut it even shorter 
with my clippers.  When everyone was finished we were left with some 
thermally-enhanced clippers and a mess of hair on the floor which had 
to be swept up.  We finished with Maia Cudhea being bald (she was the 
first one earlier that evening), and also Rob, Bryan Beck, Keith 
Lawlor, and Frank Roestler had a mowhawk, Adam Lock and Alex 
Riefenstahl had new undercuts, and Tia Lawlor had the back of her 
hair shaved underneath.
</p>
<p>
After that things calmed down a bit and rolled on steadily until 
morning.  Writing this, I have a feeling like I'm leaving out 
something important but I can't think of what it is.
</p>
<p>
This morning when I was going to breakfast I noticed that Rob's head 
looked a little funny, so I felt it and realized that he had shaved 
it all the way down to the skin with Bobby's razor.
</p>
<p>
Um, that's all the important stuff I can think of, and I'm tired of 
writing now.  Signing off.
</p>
<p>
In a good mood,<br>

Wednesday<br>
7/30/97<br>
2:42 am<br>
</p>
<p>
The fimo workshop was yesterday, as well as the mud workshop.  The 
special event was casino night, with pixi stik wannabes used for 
money.  I'm sure it was a lot of fun, but I didn't go.  Worship was 
in the library after it, but I didn't go to that either.  I started 
to, but for some reason I just wasn't up to it.  I was in that 
restless mindset where nothing I do feels comfortable.  I feel that 
way a bit now.  All the emotional energy from worship 
tonight built up and then dropped.  I don't think I'll skip worship 
anymore, though.  Tonight's service reminded me how good they can be.
</p>
<p>
The body painting workshop was this morning, and worship planning 
and lamas and candle decorating were later.  I didn't go to any 
workshops today, mostly I just hung out in a lazy fashion.  The 
special event this evening was the visitation by the young adults.  
That was really cool.  I almost went to sleep before worship, but as 
soon as I got into the library I woke up.  For the ceremony, everyone 
was silent while we went around in a circle, each person walking to 
the middle and lighting one of many small candles from the big flame 
in the middle, and discarding the gum we had been given on the way in 
on a saucer representing the community.  Then afterwards we got 
emotional and did lots of hugging and took a picture of all the 
candles melted in the sand.  It turned out that there were exactly 
the right amount of candles for everybody.
</p>
<p>
After worship I tried to do some meditation guided by our chaplain 
Peggy Cheney, but things went wrong and it didn't work.  Maybe next 
time.
</p>
<p>
I know people complain about the whole cafeteria situation, i.e. 
wearing shoes and a shirt, and no swearing, , but for all the good it 
will do here are my thoughts on the subject.  The cafeteria rules are 
a blessing in disguise.  If everything went smoothly then group camp 
would be a lot less exciting.  Variety is the spice of life and our 
problems are a subtle form of variety.  The situation we've been put 
in has sparked a lot of useful creativity.  It's not very hard on us 
at all, but instead is challenging and very entertaining.  I have 
enjoyed all the jokes and pranks that have been a result of the lunch 
ladie's stinginess.  So give them a bow.  They deserve it for making 
group camp more entertaining and memorable.
</p>
<p>
In a lighter mood now,<br>

<p>


Friday<br>
8-1-97<br>
3:00 am<br>
</p>
<p>
I skipped writing for two whole days this time, so I have some 
catching up to do.  Workshops yesterday were beads and dream 
catchers, and later, in the afternoon, Andy took Debe, Erika, John 
Thompson, Nathan Ryan, Sean Murray, Ben Muller, and me on a geology 
workshop.  We went to the old group camp and learned about fossils.  
Going back to the sight of my first SWUUSI was so wonderful, it 
brought back lots of happy memories of that week two years ago.  I 
saved some big pieces of driftwood for some of my friends who 
had also been there.
</p>
<p>
After that, at 8:30, we took everybody to the lodge in a couple of 
vans for the lamas circle.  Everybody was smudged as he or she 
arrived, and when the circles were formed and the bread was eaten and 
the dance was danced and the friendly, familiar chants were done, I 
felt uplifted, but I didn't get into it as much as last year.  It all 
wasn't as spectacular as the first time.
</p>
<p>
Then we zipped off to the Waffle Shoppe for a midnight snack.  
Surprisingly, they didn't remember us from last year.  I didn't order 
anything, because I wasn't hungry and I wanted to save my money.
</p>
<p>
After I got back to the bio station I settled down and went to sleep. 
I woke up for spirit circle and breakfast, then right after I 
finished eating I sat on a couch in the main room with Tiffany Bush 
and Amber Foreman for 5 straight hours, a new personal record.  I was 
asleep for an hour, and for the last two hours, right before lunch, I 
talked with Rob and Erika.  It started out as an improvised version 
of Rob's Most Important Thing in the World workshop, but was mostly a 
conversation about the nature of god.  I'm not quite sure, so don't 
quote me, but I think we agreed that there is no single most 
important thing to do in life, because if there were it would mean 
that there is only one thing that every person is supposed to be 
doing.  In case you were wondering.
</p>
<p>
This evening we watched a couple of videos that John Thompson had 
shot of people doing wacky things.  They were hilarious and put 
together excellently.  I'm not sure if that was before or after the 
coffeehouse.
</p>
<p>
The coffeehouse was the main event tonight.  I finally got a taste of 
some excellent and enlightening groovy juice (for you, Anna) made by 
Jeremy Loomis-Norris, who, by the way, decided to follow the trend 
and have his head shaved tonight before worship.  The talent show was 
excellent and went right along with the coffeehouse.  There was a lot 
of singing and playing, and the adult staff's descriptions of 
themselves set to the tune of "Yogi Bear", and I personally formed 
1/3 of the three-headed wonder, aided by Willy Wagner and Nathan 
Sexton.
</p>
<p>
The worship tonight was late, 1:00, but it was ten times better than 
anything I had ever been to.  I don't know which was more plentiful;  
the crying, or the laughing.  I didn't cry myself, but there was lots 
of it going on around me.  I don't know why, but for some reason I 
wasn't totally into the worship.  Sure I was emotional, but not as 
much as everyone else was.
</p>
<p>
It ended eventually, then the library was used for a dance, and now 
they are watching videos in there.
</p>
<p>
Wakeup tomorrow is at 6:30, and I'll write all about the morning on 
the way home.
</p>
<p>
Yo, G'night,

<p>


Monday<br>
8/4/97<br>
8:31 am<br>


</p>
<p>I lied, I didn't write on the way home, it is now three days later 
and I am at home.  Reflecting, SWUUSI seems so close, yet so far 
away.
</p>
<p>
Wake up was at 6:30,Friday morning and I stayed up until about fifty 
minutes before that before I finally succumbed and fell asleep on a 
couch in the main room.  According to later reports of eye-witnesses, 
while I was asleep I called out for Dave and my sticks and asked 
Marie Shallin to sit beside me.
</p>
<p>
The first thing I saw when I woke up was Drill Sergeant Debbie 
yelling at me to wake up, then running around screaming randomly and 
abusing Dave, using him to hit things and make noise.  I hadn't been 
asleep for very long so I woke right up and quickly packed the few 
things I had taken out back into my bags and carried them out front 
and set them down.  As it turned out, I had a bunch of various 
belongings scattered about, and every time I turned around I thought 
of another one I had to find and pack.
</p>
<p>
Debbie told me to get the pit empty, so I went upstairs and spread 
the word, then Tia called the touch group leaders and gave them their 
choices of cleanup patrols.  I took the pavilion and the beach, so 
while three guys policed the pavilion, Willy Wagner, Nathan Sexton, 
and I combed the beach for the occasional bit of trash that had been 
dropped in the past week.  Fairly simple.  Our group hadn't left much 
trash, but the beach was already littered with every sort of junk
you can think of: motor oil and anti-freeze containers, soda cans, 
beer bottles and cans, food wrappers, bleach and milk jugs, trot 
lines, and huge mostly-rotten skeletons of catfish and gar.  The 
three of us shared thoughts about how disheartening it was to look at 
the beautiful beach junked up so badly.
</p>
<p>
We went back to the main building and things were coming along.  The 
pit was empty of people and bags so I picked up all the trash I could 
find in it.  After what seemed like a very long time all the cleaning 
was finally finished and we went to the pavilion for closing circle.  
We sang the buzzard song, and yogi bear, and passed a hug, and 
described the week by naming it an adjective, and played the knot 
game, and did the big lap sit thing, and finally the new seniors got 
in a circle in the center and led a round of good friends and while 
it was going suddenly broke out with Bish-Bish.
</p>
<p>
Then we went out front to wait and say our goodbyes there.  It was no 
fun saying goodbye, and it seemed even worse because it was so 
dragged out.  It's a lot easier to say goodbye in twenty minutes than 
it is over two hours.  My mom finally got back with the mug books, 
not quite in time to catch everybody, and the mugbooks were received 
in the cafeteria, some assembly required.  Outside, everyone was all, 
"Seeya in San Antonio, right?"  "Yeah,  you bet."  It seemed like 
forever until most of the youths were finally gone, and it was my 
turn to leave.  There were just a few people who stayed after me, and 
I said goodbye to them one last time.  Aaron Ivener rode to the lodge 
with us, so his parents could pick him up, and with our stuff and his 
stuff, including a guitar and sleeping bag and everything else, the 
entire trunk and every available inch of airspace in the car was 
filled.
</p>
<p>
We got to the lodge and Aaron got in his parent's truck, and we 
caravaned back with them and another guy, Chuck, from Jonesboro, who 
had walkie talkies that the adults played with, and we followed them 
all the way to Hot Springs where we stopped and stayed at my 
grandparent's house until the following morning, and I got a good, 
long night's sleep.  I love all you guys and I miss you a lot, and 
I'll see you whenever we meet again.
</p>
<p>
Later,<br>
Dane & Dave
