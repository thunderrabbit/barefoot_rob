<p class=date>16-18 January 1998</p>
<p>

After a few weeks of receiving registrations via mail and phone and
fax and email, we had 111 youth registrations and 22 adult
registrations.  I received 7 registrations on the Friday the rally
began.  Holy cow what a huge rally!
<p>
Friday morning I picked up the T-shirts bearing our controversial
"Imagine the Cat in the Hat Burning the Flag" title and image of a
seedy looking cat holding a lighter.  In the background is an American
flag except the stars are replaced by a large question mark.  I had
ordered and picked up 130 shirts.
<p>
Friday day Denise and I spent $520 buying a lot of food.
<p>
Friday night the people started pouring in.  Everything stayed calm
and stable, but just slowly wound up and up as more people arrived.
At 1am we had a rally virgin opening circle and it went a little long
as I couldn't think of what I wanted to say.  I think we got it all
covered and it was all good.
<p>
Opening circle for the whole rally was at 2am, and I tossed Jon W-L
out in the middle of the circle and said, "go for it," assuming he
knew what to say.  So opening circle was a bit shaky, but still fun
and funny.  At one point, Arlene D was hollering something about
something while we were trying to define the No Sex rule.  I hollered
over toward her from my <em><b>Pulp Fiction</b></em> favorite quote list, "tell that
bitch to chill! .. Tell her 'chill, bitch, chill!' ... Yolanda!
Yolanda!  What's Fonzie like?  Dassright!  he's coool.  and that's
what we're going to be.  we gonna be cooool."  Kim S is the only
person I saw who noticed and knew what it was from.
<p>
After opening circle, double chaos began as I let everyone go at the
same time to their touch groups, and no one knew who was in their
touch group and it was nuts.  The rally had begun like crap and I was
feeling a bit responsible.
(let this be a lesson if you're designing a rally: give everyone a
bead or something that tells what group they're in, *or* send each
group out one at a time by calling each individual's name.)
<p>
After helping people get to their touch groups, I finally made it to
mine and helped Anna M out a bit and we had a great touch group.
<p>
I stayed up talking with people and stuff until like 4:30am.
<p>
My internal rally-clock woke me up excited after sleeping 3.5 hours; I
went to wake up Charlotte, the touch group leader in charge of making
breakfast.  I found her in the kitchen with her touchgroup and
breakfast was practically made!!!  Yay!!  All the anxiety I felt about
the chaotic start of the rally flittered away like happy butterflies.
<p>
I bounced around talking to others who had woken up and many who had not
slept yet.
<p>
Later I was talking to a few advisors outside.  We had been talking
about emotions and the meaning of life when Charlie G had just brought
up the book _Conversations with God_ by Neale Walsch. I told him I
hadn't read it, but was interested.  He commented that bringing up
that book makes people leave the conversation because no one wants to
talk about it.  "Hmmm," I thought.
<p>
Soon Daniel or someone ran up and was all, "Rob!  We're playing
Ultimate over in the parking lot!"<br>
Cool. As I left to play, Charlie was all, "see- it clears the table
because no one wants to talk about it."<br>
My brain jerked back, "what?" Holy moly..  He had just said bringing
up the book would clear the table, I promptly disbelieved that and
forgot about it and left the table.  Wow!
<p>
During Ultimate, we had great fun, even playing while the disc had a
big crack in it.  We even played two short spontaneous games after the
disk was broken, claiming the bigger section was worth three-quarters
of a point, and I was part of the group playing for one-quarter of a
point.
<p>
At 2:30 or so, our theme speaker, Warren Apel from Arizona, talked
about First Amendment rights, including but not condoning flag
desecration.  The workshop was well attended, and quite informative.
I slept through about 1/2 of it.
<p>
I was in YAC meetings for much of the afternoon.  We selected the
youth staff for this coming SWUUSI.  I don't remember everyone who was
selected, but I do remember that Maia C and Ashley R are the co-deans,
Nathan R is the worship coordinator, Jen C is the mugbook editor, Nick
C is the special events coordinator, Adam L is the spirit leader, and
that's all I remember.  Congratulations to all who were selected!!
<p>
Soon we needed to have a YRUU meeting to vote for YAC positions. All
the YAC candidates presented their ad-lib speeches and everyone needed
to vote.
<p>
I had a bit of a logistics problem:<br>
<ul>
<li>We needed all the youth to vote for 3 YAC positions.</li>
<li>People in the kitchen had just gotten vegetarian food ready (after I
totally screwed up and didn't have any for the main dinnertime).
</li>
<li>The special event was ready to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I felt greatly pleased with how the transition turned out.  I
announced, "okay!  That's all the YAC candidates!  Now you get to vote
on your favorite 3.  And after you vote, you can eat vegetarian in the
kitchen!"  Everything went smoothly, everyone got to eat, and the
special event was inflated.  Yay!!!!
<p>
From the general youth perspective, I believe the best part of the
rally was our special event.  Jason Fricke's idea was to rent a
"Bouncy Boxing" thing.  It's one of those air-filled "moonwalk" deals
except the participants wear enormous soft boxing gloves and bounce
around and wail on one another.
<p>
To see the folded red canvas in the middle of the room slowly swell
into a fully huge bouncy boxing ring was incredible.  We had not told
anyone what was growing to be the special event.  I loved it.
I never challenged anyone to boxing, but I jumped and jumped about 5
different times with various people.  It was the most fun I've had in
a long while.
<p>
The Bouncy Boxing was there from like 9:15 till just after midnight,
when everyone was asked to gather for the worship.  The youth had
designed another wonderful experience, building the spiritual
community to new levels of wonderfulness.
<p>
About an hour later, we gently sang our way back to the main hall for
random mingling and then the talent show!
<p>
Kristian S did a hilarious parody of Marilyn Manson's "Sweet Dreams"<br>
Sean and Steve performed one of their old rally classics, plus "Dead
Puppies" (another rally classic) and Sean sang "If I Ever Fall in
Love" a capella.<br>
Some youth recited their own emotionally harsh poetry and Mary S
dramatized a suicide to Tori Amos' song "Marianne."<br>
I performed "cool and creamy" with Jen C, singing and resulting in
whipped cream all over one another.  You should have been there!<br>  As
we cleaned that up, Aaron I and Kristian S performed Madonna's "Like a
Prayer" and some others.<br>
I got to drum for Mike N rapping, *and* Jen C & Dane D did part III of
San Antonio Saki, with Kristian S and I lip synching their words and
other sound effects.  Very funny... especially Kris.<br>
Then Shira (I think) performed her most annoying sound and the show
kinda fizzled from there.
<p>
Then we had a SWUUSI 1997 dance relapse with the wacky Seasame Street
song (I still don't know who performs that) twice!!!!  What an
incredible energy drain is that song!
Then Korn (I don't know what song) was played several times and I stayed
up cleaning with some youth for about 1.5 hours.
I greatly appreciate their help.
<p>
I slept from 4:30am to 6:00am.  
<p>
We groggily got up at 6 to clean clean clean and amazingly, by 8am, the
place was perfect. 
Closing circle out in the parking lot and I was deeply emotionally
touched when I hugged Charlie G and he gave me a beautiful hardback copy
of <em>Conversations With God</em>.   
<p>
What a perfect touch to a perfect weekend!</p>

                        <h1>1997 Little Rock rally review by Rob</h1>

<hr>

<p><p>
5 - 007 December 1997
<p>
The Little Rock Rally was, of course, absolutely incredible.<br />
<p>
I didn&rsquo;t look forward to the 9.5 hour drive, but as I expected, the
conversation was plenty invigorating to keep us chatting the entire
way up there.  In the rental car was Cathy S, KT H and I.  I brought
up a question that&rsquo;s been bouncing through my head for a while.
<p>
What are emotions?  Best I can tell is they <em>must</em> be experienced, and
maybe emotions are the reason we are alive.  The conversation turned
toward to What are instincts?  Are they related to emotions?
<p>
Notice how on an evolutionary scale, instincts (of a mosquito or
&ldquo;lesser&rdquo; animal) seem to be replaced by the emotions of dogs and humans
and other &ldquo;greater&rdquo; animals..  Hmmm..
<p>
(If you are intrigued, write me back and I&rsquo;ll send you my essay on the
subject)
<p>
We got there and it was <strong>cold</strong>!!  Well, chilly and late.. about 1:30
in the AM, I believe.  The rally craziness indicator was at a low
simmer.  Marc L and Tera L (different Ls) were already there and I was
glad to talk with them for a while.  Marc taught us some new songs and
games. &ldquo;Little Sally Walker&rdquo; was one song we learned that night.
<p>
Opening circle was cool.  Everyone tossed in their shoes and then we
all chose someone else&rsquo;s shoes and thereby randomly selected our new
neighbors in the circle, and the order in which we introduced
ourselves.  After that, we just stayed up late yakin&rsquo; and talkin&rsquo; and
having a lovely time.  I crashed at about 5 AM or so..
<p>
The next day I joined a group playing <em>Assassin</em> and got promptly
tagged by Tera the first game.  I did better in the second game,
chasing Max around the parking lot for a bit.  That was a good
stretch, especially since I was running barefoot, and I haven&rsquo;t
otherwise been going barefoot much lately.
<p>
We also played <em>Animal Tag</em> and that was pretty fun..  Oh yeah!  We
played a small game of <em>Wink</em> and then a game of <em>Slaughter</em>, which one
of the other advisors taught me.
<p>
The YAC meeting was longer that most of our previous in-rally
meetings, but we had a lot to cover.  We YACked about the age limits
and brainstormed some ideas on how to convince the board to allow them
to be 14-20.
<p>
Dinner was a delightful ordeal for me.  I got to sit by Marc L and we
sat patiently waiting for our food while writing and drawing on the
huge spread of butcher paper on the table before us.
<p>
When our salad came, I immediately used my fork and grabbed a bite off
Marc&rsquo;s plate.  So he had a bite off my plate.  We continued this, and
actually ate our entire dinners from the other&rsquo;s plate.  The various
people (adults and young adults) serving us would shake their heads
gently as if to say, &ldquo;whatever makes you happy&rdquo; as Marc and I would
refer to each other in 3rd person to ask the servers for food for the
other..  Does that make sense?  Nope.. You should have been there!!
<p>
We had delicious fun.
<p>
After dinner, (I believe it was after dinner) Tera L, Marc L, Kat J
and I were chillin&rsquo; in the sanctuary.  Marc&rsquo;s eyes suddenly
brightened, &ldquo;we should make a fort out of chairs!&rdquo;
Crazy!  Brilliant.
<p>
We unstacked and aligned a few chairs when Marc and Tera announced
they were going to build their own fort and we could have a war!
<p>
Kat and I randomly grabbed sleeping bags and carefully placed the
chairs to hold the bags as our roof.  With permission, we used Mark
A&rsquo;s massage table, which turned out to be a great part of our
fortress.
<p>
After not too long, Tera ran over to our side to spy on us or
something equally benign, and I captured her as our first prisoner!  I
led her into our fort, and underneath the massage table to her jail
cell.  She escaped without too much trouble, so we reinforced it with
more chairs and stuff.
<p>
The playfulness was delightful.  Kat was captured at least twice, and
at one point we had both Marc and Tera in our jail.
<p>
But the very funniest thing was when I was following one of our
prisoners into the fort and instead of going straight to the jail,
they stood up through a hole in the top (designed for throwing socks)
and climbed right out!
<p>
Yes, you had to be there.
<p>
I was dragging tired and had to miss the worship service, which I
believe was led by Marc.  I would have enjoyed attending, but I had to
<em>sleep</em>!
<p>
I was gently woken by some youth (I think Anna M and KT H) who really
really really wanted me to see the Talent Show.  I felt greatly loved
and went right up there.
<p>
Marc and Meghan R had just finished a whipped cream skit.  I was
going to be Marc&rsquo;s partner in it, but I was sleepin&rsquo;.<br />
Whew..  It woulda been fun, but I was glad to remain whipped-cream-less.
<p>
I don&rsquo;t remember much of what I saw at the talent show; my contacts
were out and my brain was sleeping.
<p>
The next morning after closing circle where we handed out Houston
Rally Registration forms (send me email if you want one) and sang and
had a great time, several youth stayed for Marc L&rsquo;s sermon.
<p>
The topic was &ldquo;Sacred Silliness,&rdquo; describing the value of silliness in
spiritual and emotional growth, especially as it applies to YRUU.
Afterwards I asked if we could put it on the webpage.  With an
emphatic &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; Marc said he would mail it to me (but I haven&rsquo;t gotten
it yet!!!  (MARC, ARE YOU READING??))
<p>
As we collected in the parking lot for the trip home, youth from OKC
and Cathy S and KT H were all goofing around.  It was decided we would
take Scott to Houston and they would take Cathy to OKC.  Nancy M was
all, &ldquo;wha???  OKC is not exactly on the way to Houston,&rdquo; not
recognizing that we were jokin&rsquo;.
<p>
We did, however, join them for lunch at Subway, extending the rally
love one more hour.  Scott gave me a big swig of the Groovy Juice and
KT got to drive the car (don&rsquo;t tell!) from our parking spot to the pay
phone and back.  (a whole 500 feet!)
<p>
The weather rained on the way home, but we had big fun.  The best game
we played was &ldquo;Read All The Traffic Signs On The Side Of The Road.&rdquo;
Read all the words and say what the symbol signs mean (&ldquo;merge left&rdquo;,
&ldquo;slippery when wet&rdquo;) and say &ldquo;dot&rdquo; for each small circular reflector.
Design your own such game!  It was enough to keep us entertained for
50 minutes, the entire way from before Conroe till we got into Houston
area.
<p>
Amazing fun and see you all at Houston Rally!!

<hr>

<p><p></p>

<p>woke up and went to lamar with my mom to get my college day shit out of
the way; wrote a review of scrooge for my brother, and bitched at my boss
for scheduling me to work sunday.  rode to houston, cruzed rob&rsquo;s &lsquo;hood
with my parents waiting for him to get home; got to his house and saw ROB
IN PANTS!  scary.  then he immediately changed into shorts (he&rsquo;s rob
isn&rsquo;t he?)
<p>
then we went to rob&rsquo;s workplace to drop off his computer.  i waited in
the car.  Isn&rsquo;t it scary to think about rob working all day??  then we
went to taco cabana and ate and then we went to emerson to pick up KT.
then we started on the road and of course rob got us in one of his
wonderful/amazing/deep conversations.  the subject of this one was
emotions.   we kept riding and then we stopped at a gas station and i&rsquo;m
all &ldquo;um rob&ndash;i know this is a no smoking rally but what about now??&rdquo;  so
i smoked and ate chocolate and then we kept on riding sooooo long.  then
we stopped at another very strange gas station/convenience
store/restaurant/i dunno animal trophy display.  there were deer heads
everywhere and there was also a live snake, a huge snake.  weird.  then
we rode some more then we <em>finally</em> got there.
<p>
i walked up and saw carina!  what a surprise!  then i came in and saw
susanne and aaron and tiffany.  yay.  everyone was really laid back
though.  then all of a sudden a maia and a jeremy were running at me with
open arms (maia later told me that her and jeremy were sitting and jeremy
was like &ldquo;houston needs to get here&rdquo; and maia said &ldquo;check the door&rdquo; and
me and rob and kt were there. more proof that maia truly is the bomb).
then i was being hugged from behind by an unknown person who turned out
to be austin.  yay.  then me and austin and maia and jeremy did this 4
person hug for a good while.  then max and nancy got there double yay.
then i saw arlene!  yay yay yay.<br />
<p>
man what else?  opening circle.  then everyone awake started playing mau
or however you spell it and me and nancy were like that sucks so we
started sliding around on the floor in our socks and nancy fell down.  it
was so very funny.  :-)
<p>
um what else.  hung out with everyone.  like everyone was sleeping on the
Friday night!  what the fuck?? i think me and jeremy were the only ones
who stayed up the whole time.  nancy stayed awake most of the time.  in
the morning me and jeremy and nancy went outside to watch the sun rise.
then, when everyone was sleeping me and jeremy and nancy were being very
evil.  we found some big ass bubble wrap in the kitchen and started
popping it really loudly in the sanctuary where everyone was sleeping.
they weren&rsquo;t exactly happy with us.  then i lay down in the hall with
jeremy and melissa and nancy.  oh my god&ndash;me and jeremy wrapped melissa
up in her sleeping bag and like folded her body over and she looked like
a little baby.  so cute/funny!  breakfast was good; we got to see all
those silly people who slept.  we were making fun of austin for eating
cookies in his cereal.  what a weirdo.<br />
<p>
then me and jeremy and rob and nancy and max and bunch of other people
played assassin.  it was great fun.<br />
<p>
hmm&hellip; what did we do after that??  lunch i guess.  sandwiches with cool
bread and stuff.<br />
<p>
later we danced in the sanctuary and tried to play seasame street but we
just couldn&rsquo;t do it without nathan.
<p>
then massage workshop started in there (ew..yucky) so i slept in a big
puppy pile on jeremy&rsquo;s stomach who was on susanne who was on aaron who
melissa was on and tiffany and fricke were in there somewhere too,
probably some other people too, who knows?  yac meeting started so it was
just me and tiffany and susanne left to sleep in one sleeping bag
(um-against the rules)
<p>
saturday night we had dinner.  it was in little rock tradition with it&rsquo;s
courses and being served and all.  sheri-ann was there and she served us
macaroni.  yay.<br />
<p>
i spent a lot of saturday night (and the rally on a whole) hanging out
with tiffany.  that was awesome &lsquo;cause we really bonded.  we talked about
lots of stuff and just got to know each other better; it was great.<br />
<p>
me and nancy and chris anderson and tia had fun yelling things into
chris&rsquo;s fine ass laptop which he brought along to do a paper and
recording them.  (that sentence was a mastery of grammar).  then austin
and tiffany came over and told us weird stories about working for erick
and stuff.<br />
<p>
stayed up &lsquo;til 3:30 with tiffany and then we decided to sleep but chris
was using my sleeping bag as a pillow so i didn&rsquo;t want to wake him up so
i ganked somebody else&rsquo;s sleeping bag and went to sleep.  then i was
awakened by the owner of this sleeping bag standing over my head.  so i
relinquished this sleeping bag and gently picked chris&rsquo;s head up and took
my sleeping bag and replacing chris&rsquo;s pillow with someone else&rsquo;s sleeping
bag.  hey&ndash;your stuff, my stuff doesn&rsquo;t matter-it&rsquo;s rally love.
<p>
then we had to wake up yucky.
<p>
and we ate bagels and had closing circle and rob is all &ldquo;we&rsquo;re staying
for the service&rdquo;  kick ass. so i got to hang out so much longer with
tiffany and susanne and melissa and nancy and max and jeremy and aaron
and meghan.  but sadly jeremy had to go (not without getting a big hicky
from aaron first) and then max and nancy had to go.  so me and tiffany
and susanne and meghan hung out some more.  we started discussing
tattoos.  they made me pull down my pants and show them mine again. <br>
crazy monkeys.
<p>
then we stayed for the service which was wonderful and the greatest thing
about it was,  marc is giving his sermon, dressed all nice and yet there
is a little piece of glitter on his face.  :-)
then the last hymn was about dancing so everyone started dancing and
gavin and his incredibly cute self was dancing with a woman from the
little rock congregation.<br />
<p>
we started to leave but okc kept trying to kidnap me.  but then we went
20 miles out of our way to eat at subway with okc.  that was great.<br />
<p>
then we started on our loooooong drive home and created a &ldquo;read all the
signs on the road&rdquo; game.  rob played with us for a good while until he
started swerving for paying too much attention to the road sign and not
enough to the actual road.  then we added the word &ldquo;bitch&rdquo; or &ldquo;bitch
mother fucking bitch&rdquo; to the ends of signs we saw too much.  so this is
what it sounded like for an hour:  &ldquo;dot dot dot dot dot dot Willis 45
Exit 101 Mile 101 South Interstate 45 bitch mother fucking bitch dot dot
dot dot dot exit 102 move your ass 16 feet 12 inches bitch watch for ice
on bridge bitch mother fucking bitch.&rdquo;  very funny and actually quite
entertaining.
<p>
finally we got back to rob&rsquo;s apartment and all sat around being grumpy
and tired.  and then i still had to ride all the way back to beaumont
with my dad.  so i didn&rsquo;t get in my bed &lsquo;till 1:30 and then school the
next day!  aaa!! soooooo worth it though!
<p>
i love you all!<br>
cathy<br></p>

                        <p class=date>Wednesday 3 December 1997</p>

<p><p>
For our Wednesday Night LRY dinner outing, we collected at Chuck E. Cheese&rsquo;s Magical (Satanical) Pizza Place.
<p>
KT and I decided it was satanical because their phone number starts with 666.  We decided it was magical because their phone message says so!  (Those reading who don&rsquo;t know me or us: don&rsquo;t take it seriously.)
<p>
Jon W and Sean C were already there when Wende and I arrived.  We ordered a large cheese pizza and got tasty beverages and 120 tokens (actually 126 came out.  hee!) Before we had paid, KT H and Dennis and Adam W arrived.
<p>
Anyways, we all ate and watched the robot-ish animated characters and then played video games and ski-ball and stuff.  Sean and I played a two-player dinosaur shooting game and the seat shook around to mimic what we saw on the screen.
<p>
We played much ski-ball and Adam won the jackpot of 182 tickets by getting 350 points.
<p>
But there were two coolest things about the night:
<p>
<ul>
<li>While I played a ball shooting game, a baby and his mother were sitting by me.  I suddenly remembered what Linda L recently told me after I wrote my thing on
<a href=../../gravity/gravity06.html>ESP</a>. <font size=-1>(side note: as I tried to type &ldquo;gravity07.html&rdquo; I mis-typed &ldquo;gravity06&rdquo;  Turns out gravity06 was correct&hellip;)</font>
<p>
Linda wrote:<br>
<blockquote>
Children before they have a firm grasp of the english( or for that matter
any) language must depend on nonverbal communication. By the age of 2 they
are masters of reading body language and facial expressions. Unfortunatly,
when they begin to learn how to vocalize their needs they forget the lines
of communication they were born with.
Try this: Make eye contact with a small child in a public place. Try to read
what they are sending to you. Watch how the mother and child are
communicating. If the mother is connected with the child&rsquo;s needs the kid
will be generally happy. If she is ignoring the kid (or wants to exert her
will over the childs) the kid will show it usually by crying or worse. Most
times there is a great amount of fustration involved if the mother doesn&rsquo;t
make an effort to be observant to the childs non-verbal signals.
</blockquote>
<p>
I smiled gently toward the baby and opened my mind to him.  He immediately smiled at me and began to verbally speak something like, &ldquo;bahb ahb&rdquo; (I of course wanted to hear &ldquo;Rob&rdquo;).  I looked into his eyes for a while, asking &ldquo;what are you thinking?  what is in your mind?&rdquo;  <br>
I didn&rsquo;t recognize any blatant communication, but I was quite pleased that he looked up at me for a bit.<p></li>
<li>I and kT and Dennis and Jon all climbed up into the tunnels and bright plastic ball pits and had a marvelous time.  I have never (that I remember) gotten to play in a ball pit before!  We buried ourselves, splashed the balls around, threw the balls around and generally had a ball.
<p>
At one point I lost my pager in them all, and we splashed around for a bit looking for it. Wende paged it, but I found it without consciously hearing it beep.  I really enjoyed thrashing around in there.
</li>

                        <p class=date>weekend of 21-23 November 1997</p>

<p><p>
This weekend we had our Construct-O-Con planning rally for the
full blown rally in January.<br />
Anna M, Charlotte B, Christina L, Jason F, Jim M, Jon M, Jon W, KT H, Nick C, Rob N and Wende W were all there for most of the weekend.
<p>
We were way more productive than I had expected. The first night we got the theme figured out: &ldquo;Imagine The Cat in the Hat (burning the flag)&rdquo;  (or something like that.) (Last year we didn&rsquo;t even start planning until 5pm Saturday.) We wanted an imagination-provoking theme, and one of the main speakers will be discussing First Amendment rights, including (but not necessarily encouraging) the right to burn the US flag.
<p>
The next day, we hammered out the schedule and disbursed the various tasks to those who were present.  I look forward to a super great rally with these guys.
<p>
Though we were dragging by the end of Saturday, we got the T-Shirt design completed, and it was all good.
<p>
Also during the weekend, we play much hackey sack, listened to Jason&rsquo;s bump while playing frisbee, watched 3 or 4 movies, including <em>Brain Candy</em> (which we watched at last year&rsquo;s Construct-O-Con), <em>Mars Attacks</em>, and a freaky stop action animation film by Frank Zappa, which was mostly clay animation, and I was amazed at the detail they created, especially for such a long movie!  It was pretty incredible.
<p>
Sunday morning we cleaned up and got up.  I&rsquo;m thankful for Wende who was much better at describing to the LRY group (who were mostly not at the lock-in) about the joy of rallies and designing them and all that.<br>
Next rally is Little Rock Rally 5-007 December 1997</p>

                        <h1>1997 San Antonio rally review by Rob</h1>

<hr>

<p><p>
The slugless San Antonio Rally, 31 October - 2 November 1997 was a most entirely excellent rally.
<p>
Special guests Drake Baer and Gregor Faron were flown in from Metro New York District to attend as normal advisor and youth, as part of a &ldquo;district exchange&rdquo; program to encourage communication in YRUU between the districts.
<p>
The first night was normal high energy rally bounciness, with PHUUFs for some of the rally virgins, toe tags to identify touch group affiliation, Surge, chocolate, mugbook picture taking and everything else that starts a rally.
<p>
After most everyone had arrived, Arlene and I got to lead the rally virgin meeting, which we did just before the main opening circle.  Given the number of PHUUFs that had been given, the new youths were a bit nervous about what we planned.  (Fact is, nothing was planned; we led the meeting ad lib fashion)  We assured them they had nothing to worry about.  I started by simply describing the indescribable value of the community, and how it all works just with the Big Four rules.  We empowered them to say NO if they were uncomfortable, and to simply have a great time at the rally.  I think it went rather well.
<p>
After the main opening circle, we just played and did whatever until like 3am I think I went to bed.  Maybe 3:30.
<p>
The next morning, we had pancakes and cereal for breakfast.  Yay!<br />
<p>
The morning workshop I attended was Q&amp;A with Drake and Greg.<br> They asked us to present any problems we see with YRUU programming at a district or local level.  We did so and during the workshop, we basically compiled all the problems and broke into groups and solved each of them.  Amazing!  We felt the workshop was so successful and worthwhile that Drake offered to transcribe our work and email it out.  I will put it on our webpage when I receive it.
<p>
The afternoon workshop was tarot card reading.  There was no organization to the workshop, but people got out all their cards and did readings for one another.  I brought my Runes and did about 6 readings for people.  Pretty much everyone was quite impressed with the appropriateness of the Rune readings.
<p>
During the day I drummed with Austin R on Jon W&rsquo;s drums.  We jammed for about 15 minutes outside in the yummy sunshine.  We attracted a small crowd, including Jon who clapped at the end; I got warm fuzzies from that.
<p>
I also got to play with Stacy&rsquo;s diablo, a spinning yo yo thing that she often brings to rallies.
<p>
My personally coolest moment of the weekend occurred in the 20 minutes before the worship service.  I lay down to take a nap and my brain was so excitedly awake, while my body was so tired, that my body instantly fell asleep and my brain stayed awake. Cool. I love that state of consciousness.<br>
I tried something I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do for a while: to simply move my etheric body out of my physical body. I focused gently on my arm, trying to raise my etheric arm without moving my physical arm.  As usual, it wasn&rsquo;t working.  Then something tinked my memory about visualizing what I want. (My brain said, &ldquo;visualize what you want.&rdquo;)  Oh yeah- I had forgotten.  Thanks, brain!
<p>
So I visualized myself standing in the room.  Instantly, my body began the tingling, oscillating, spinning feeling that I&rsquo;ve associated with out of body experiences!
<p>
&ldquo;Oh this is cool!&rdquo; and &ldquo;remain calm&rdquo; went through my mind.
<p>
I set up a quick protection field around me just in case anything wacky might happen otherwise.
<p>
I visualized exactly what the room should look like, and I kept feeling the tingling oscillating, but never got much past that. I was too excited to let the process happen.
Soon Wende walked in to wake me up for the worship.  I told her with as much excitement as my sleepy physical body could muster about my experience.  Wow.
<p>
The worship was a pagan ritual celebrating the day of the dead, when the veil between the world of the living and the world of the dead is most thin.  Nice worship, but it didn&rsquo;t result in emotionally charged sniffles and tears around the room as most youth-designed worships do.
<p>
Soon thereafter, I greatly encouraged Tia to begin the YAC meeting; I didn&rsquo;t want to be up all night meeting, and I especially didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the possibility of us not getting the YAC stuff done this weekend. <br>
We met and invited anyone who was interested to join.  A bowl of toasted pumpkin seeds was a salty welcome addition to the meeting.<br>
The main thing we determined was when to have elections for YAC members.  We planned to elect 2 youth that night, 3 in Houston, and 3 youth and 1 adult in Oklahoma City.
<p>
During the YAC meeting, a group played Silent Football!  Without me!!  Oh, the things I do for YAC&hellip;.
<p>
At around midnight or 1am, the talent show was one of the funniest I&rsquo;ve attended ever. Kriscott and Aaron did a guitar duet, which was excellent of course.  Jennifer and Dane did a poorly lip-synched Japanese fighting movie, <em>San Antonio Saki</em> with Kris and me doing their voices.  That was so hilarious since it was totally ad-libbed.. Kris and I were just making up threats and curses and craziness
<p>
&ldquo;Your mother is a side of beef&rdquo;  <br>
&ldquo;I have attacked great lizard and killed it with one blow from my psycho fist punch&rdquo; <br>
&ldquo;Ouch!  You have broken my leg!&rdquo;
<p>
Ya had to be there&hellip;
<p>
It turned out way funnier than I had expected; certainly the lateness of the hour magnified the funniness factor.
<p>
Steve F played &ldquo;Rocky Raccoon&rdquo; on guitar, a YRUU favorite.
<p>
Shawn (sp), a graduated YRUUer played guitar &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo; and a capella &ldquo;If I ever fall in love again&rdquo; and something on piano.
<p>
Kimmi played something on piano which just grabbed the emotions and anticipations I loved it.
<p>
Some of the newer youth heard I could tell The Clown Joke, but more youth were like, &ldquo;no! no! no!&rdquo; so I didn&rsquo;t.<br />
<p>
Then, much to my surprise, San Antonio Saki Part II was performed.  This time, Kris and I did the voices from our comfortable prone positions in the audience, and this time it was funnier.  It started out just as,
<p>
&ldquo;I have returned from the dead to seek revenge!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I will again put you to death with my evil fist!&rdquo;
<p>
and then Dane started to get crazy and rip off his shirt, so I was all
<p>
&ldquo;Oh yeah, mother fucker? I&rsquo;m gonna kick your fuckin ass, bitch!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Bring it on, tough guy!&rdquo;
<p>
or something like that.
<p>
I was deleriously laffin&rsquo; after that.  So nutty funny.<br />
<p>
Somewhere during the show, &ldquo;Improv Tag&rdquo; was started.  At first the scene was two ditzy preppy girls and then it turned to someone having a baby and Chris asked me to do his voice when he froze it.  So he goes &ldquo;freeze!&rdquo; and walked up there and I do the same voice I used for the San Saki Antonio, &ldquo;I have come to attack you and your family!&rdquo;  That was pretty funny.  and then it went to shit when Bryan and Shawn were looking at a huge pile of shit.  Aaron goes, &ldquo;freeze!&rdquo; and both Aaron and Scott walked up with their guitars and kicked both Bryan and Shawn offstage and began to play.  I loved it!
<p>
But even better was Chris A who froze them halfway through the song and kicked one off the stage to continue the game!
<p>
It got crazy and then everyone walked off stage, and of course people yelled &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; at the empty stage&hellip;
<p>
After a few more talents (or not) people wondered at someone placing garbage bags on the stage.  What could they be planning?  Then two six-packs of Surge appeared onstage.  From my comfortable prone position, I lept toward the stage.  I&rsquo;ll challenge anyone at a Surging contest!   Turns out that the contestants were already chosen: Aaron I and Jason F.
They started chugging; Jason with grimace on face, and Aaron with one hand on his hip, gently drinking and appeared almost to be taking his time.  After a moment, several members of the crowd rushed the stage to greedily partake of the tasty beverage under the guise of helping the competitors.  I joined, and gulped one of Aaron&rsquo;s cans.  Soon all of Aaron&rsquo;s were empty and he was announced the winner after 1 minute and 36 seconds!  Amazing!
<p>
Jason later told me that no one helped drink any of his, which I thought was surprising and actually kinda funny.
<p>
The next morning after cleanup, we had donuts and talked talked talked until we simply had to leave.  We stopped by Taco Cabana for lunch and got home around 2:30pm.  I slept until 7am the next day.</p>

                        <h1>1997 San Antonio rally review by Mike</h1>

<hr>

<p><p></p>

<p>Ok, first tera little picked me up at my house in plano at about 4 pm friday.
<p>
 Then tera and nathan sexton and i drove down to san antonio. it was kinda
bad though cuz tera&rsquo;s car doesn&rsquo;t have a clock or a radio, but we survived.
Anyway, this is a good part. right before we got to the church, we called
from the texaco station and got bryan beck on the phone. we told bryan tera
got lost in waco and somehow ended up in this small town called sealy
somewhere near houston.
<br>
So bryan ran around the church looking for a map and we drove to the church
and tapped bryan on the back, said hey bryan what up? bryan almost started
crying. it was hilarious&hellip;.
<p>
anyway, friday night we got there really early so there wasn&rsquo;t much going on
for a while. but opening circle was really good, they read a summary of what
samhain was and then everybody wrote a little samhain resolution and taped it
on the wall.
then broke into touch groups, that was fun i guess.
<p>
rest of night, nothing much happened.
<br>
Oh hold on, we watched South Park which was really good, i had never seen it
before since i dont get cable.
<p>
In the morning, had breakfast, the apple jacks were REAL good stuff.
The morning workshop I went to was the discussion with Drake Baer and Greg
Faron, the guys from Metro NY District (Princeton UU Church). This was really
good, we got to discuss a lot of the problems the Southwest District was
having and some solutions. I think it really helped me out&hellip;
<p>
Lunch was excellent, i loved that turkey.
Afternoon tarot workshop was awesome, those cards were really weird, they
predicted my life so well i was shocked!
then there was the smoking workshop, i didn&rsquo;t go, but most people who did go
said it was a lot of propaganda that they had already heard 10 million times
before, a waste of time&hellip;
<p>
Then dinner was awesome, yet again. I got deja vu looking at the dinner
table, cause it looked exactly the same as last years.
then sat. nite was really busy. The YAC meeting was interesting, my first.
 the bylaws were passed by YRUU, so the age range is increased to 20 and YAC
is going to be 8 youth and 4 adults now.
Then there were yac elections and after some confusion Maia Cudhea and Nathan
Ryan were elected.
Then the talent show&hellip;&hellip;.
<p>
that was basically the night.
in the morning, clean up and breakfast.
Very fun rally&hellip;..

<p>PS This isn&rsquo;t really part of the rally, part of getting there, but on the way
down there i had to listen to tera sing her silly song she sang to her kid:
<p>
I&rsquo;m a Unitarian Universalist<br>
Oh Yes I am<br>
I believe in the<br>
inherent worth and dignity<br>
of every woman and man..
<p>
Ill sing the tune 4 anybody who wants&hellip;.</p>

This evening at Taco Cabana for our weekly LRY Dinner Hangout, Jon W was already there when we arrived. He showed off his new braces and new pager; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s different about me?&rdquo; he asked as I greeted him.
<p>
We ordered and Paul R arrived as our food appeared on the counter. I got a Suicide as my tasty beverage and we sat outside to chat and chew.
<p>
We talked Rally stuff, as this coming weekend is the San Antonio Rally, and Jon and I are working on the Houston Rally for January, and the Houston Planning Rally for next month! We had just gotten out the registration forms for the Planning Rally (&ldquo;Construct-O-Con&rdquo;) a few days previously.
<p>
Jon practiced intonations (I guess that&rsquo;s what one might call them) for his drama class: practicing articulating various vowel sounds without getting tongue tied. (say that 10 times quickly)

<p><p>
At 5:45 in the am, after we had slept about 3 or 4 hours, the lights flashed on and immediately back off as Gerald came in to set up the chairs for the day.
<p>
I popped awake and hopped up and went to talk with him.  &ldquo;Um, we spent the night here last night, can you open the LRY room so we can sleep in there instead?&rdquo;<br>
He said, &ldquo;no problem&rdquo; or something equally positive and we trudged outside to the LRY room to crash.  kT claimed the larger of the two couches, so I stole a cushion off it.  <em>Whoah!</em> it&rsquo;s a couch bed!!
<p>
So we pulled out the mattress and kT and Paul crashed on the bed.  I burrowed in between them, stating, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making sure you guys don&rsquo;t try to get busy together.&rdquo;
<p>
We slept for a few more hours (actually Paul didn&rsquo;t sleep because the mattress was at a slant where he lay. I felt really bad about that when I found out) until people started arriving at church.
<p>
Wende and Paul got up and got donuts and orange juice for us to munch, which we did happily, chatting and acting silly.
<p>
The carnival was great fun, especially after rumors that it wouldn&rsquo;t happen. I most enjoyed
<ol>
<li>sneaking into the back door of the haunted house and scaring the boogies out of Emory and whoever else was back there. Once he regained his composure, he was all, &ldquo;hey! you can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; but he was wearing a glowing retainer thing and it sounded like, &ldquo;hey oo an oo ah!&rdquo; Funny!</li>
<li>after a while we went back to the LRY room, dreading the clean-up process. We were so tired&hellip; But I walked over to the haunted house and people were already cleaning it up! Three adults and some of the younger kids, and I zipped back to our room.  (I don&rsquo;t feel 1 iota bad after all the effort we put into building the thing.)</li>
</ol>
<p>
Wende&rsquo;s truck, Bill, had a flattening tire, so we got it fixed on the way home.
