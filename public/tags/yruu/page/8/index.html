                        <h1>1997 New Orleans rally review by Rob Nugen</h1>

<hr>

<p><p>
Wow
<p>
Jason Fricke, Mike Noyse, and Tony Salinas and I all drove from my apartment toward Beaumont to pick up Cathy Saur
along the way to New Orleans.  Wende could not go, though she wanted to; she was sick.
<p>
We picked up Cathy after not being able to find the house and having to call her on the car phone.  Turns out we were
pretty much right across the street from her.<br />
<p>
We stopped to get something to eat after we were most of the way there and stopped at Taco Bell.  I had wanted to
go to Wendy&rsquo;s so when I went up to the counter, I was all, &ldquo;gimme a chicken sandwich, and a medium frosty.&rdquo;
The dude was all, &ldquo;a <em>what?</em>&rdquo;    My brain clicked and I was all, &ldquo;doh!!&rdquo; etcetera.  It was pretty funny.
<p>
We got pretty much lost in New Orleans since we didn&rsquo;t have the map on the form, but we had the address and a New Orleans map.  So after driving past the Superdome, where we saw a dude with dreads down past his butt, and after driving through some partying neighborhoods, we made it to the church at like 6 or 7pm.  Early to a rally!!<br />
<p>
Big hugs to everyone and then I helped Jessica and Abby move some chairs around and get stuff ready.
People started arriving as people do at rallies and I was super impressed that I remembered Sage&rsquo;s name
all the way back from Houston Rally 1996, my first as an advisor.<br />
<p>
The normal pre-opening circle Rally Energy hummed through the group.  We played basketball, made plans for Silent Football, Animal Tag, and all kinds of craziness.  Tia Lawlor asked if we could go see Trent Reznor&rsquo;s house, which is in New Orleans.  Actually I think the word she used instead of &ldquo;see&rdquo; was &ldquo;stalk.&rdquo;<br />
<p>
I introduced a few new rally youth around to several people, until we got a match for each of them- a conversation that kept on conversing without me.  I love it when that happens.
<p>
A group was playing Wink in the chapel, led by Dan something from CMWD.  I watched.
<p>
Just before opening circle, we had a little meeting for the new rally goers.  We made sure they understood they are empowered and that everyone is equal (with the advisors being a little more equal) and that if they ever felt uncomfortable about anything, to just let somebody know.
<p>
Surprisingly, Gabe Rendon and Mike Noyse kept cutting up and goofin&rsquo; around as Debe was talking.  Debe was all, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make me take you down.&rdquo;   Mike goes, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t take an elevator down!&rdquo;     (author&rsquo;s note:  <em>Please</em> understand this was all in fun.)  Debe was left with no alternative.  She hopped out of her chair and kinda wrassled with Mike and they were both hollering and then Gabe jumped in and Mike jumped out and ran over to me for protection.  It was hilarious.
<p>
Everything back to normal, the meeting was continued, &ldquo;so anyway, we just want to let you guys know that everyone is equal and will be treated with respect.&rdquo;  Funny funny stuff.
<p>
So then we had the real opening circle and did the same cool activity as New Orleans 1996 opening circle.  Everyone had written down a question and then everyone randomly chose someone else&rsquo;s question and wrote down an answer and then everyone randomly chose a question and answer and read them out loud.  It&rsquo;s pretty fun.
<p>
I got to re-introduce the Big White Rally Book, which made its first public appearance at New Orleans 1996.  I read aloud
the entry written one year ago by Bryan Richardson, a senior at his last rally.<br />
My advertisement was effective, lots and lots of people wrote in the book this time.  Yay!
<p>
After opening circle, touch groups had their meetings, including the advisors in our own meeting.<br />
I was one of the designated awakeful persons until 7am, and the hours sure were dragging after like 5am.
<p>
The main activity in the main room was basketball.  Pretty much people were playing the entire time.  Except for
that, the rally was a gentle lower level of energy&hellip; I can&rsquo;t quite figure out why, but it just seemed that way.
<p>
At 7am I slept until breakfast at about 8something and then ate something for breakfast.  (poetic, eh?)  I had a yummy combo platter of all the sugary cereals available.<br />
I walked around a bit and then crashed back to sleep for a few hours.  I woke up around lunchtime, and was quite surprised I had slept so long.
<p>
At lunch, I talked with Dan something from CMWD and he told me some of the main differences between the cons held in that district and rallies held here.  I was astonished and quite glad to be in the Southwest District. The craziest thing they do is have home hospitality, where the conference is split up to several different houses, each taking a few youth between like midnight and 7am.  Now I may have some of my facts wrong, but that&rsquo;s what I heard, and yikes!  I like our rallies better.
<p>
More goofin&rsquo; around and one cool thing was several people helped build one of those 3D puzzle things of the White House.  That was pretty fun.<br />
<p>
Then the fabulous Spirituality of Chocolate Chip Cookie Making workshop.  Wow.   The only utensils we used were measuring cups for the flour and sugar and stuff.  Oooey gooey sugary chocolatey fun for the whole family.  I learned my lesson from last year and didn&rsquo;t get a tummy ache from eating too much dough.   One group of cookie makers for some reason (I don&rsquo;t remember exactly why, but they had a specific reason) put a lot of extra brown sugar in their mix.  The resulting dough was darker, and the resulting cookies harder, but who cares&ndash; they&rsquo;re cookies!
<p>
A couple people wanted to get a game going, so we played Elbow Tag.  I had forgotten just how tiring that game is!
We had about 8 pairs of links and then the chaser and the chased, running around the basket ball room, ducking,
running, dodging, tagging&hellip;.   Totally a great game.
We played probably 25 minutes, and then essentially everyone just quit, &ldquo;yeah, let&rsquo;s quit&rdquo; after one person suggested
quitting.  And that was it game over.  Afterward I sat sweating beside Rhoda Everett, a new advisor from Thoreau UU, south of Houston.  I invited her to play next time, but she politely declined.  Hmmmm&hellip;
<p>
After dinner, which was super wonderful lasagna homemade by Jessica Hunicke, a large group convened to play Silent Football.  I was dictator of the whole crazy ordeal.  I think we ended up with about 14 people.  (I guess that happens when
you play at 9pm instead of 2am)  It had been a while since I had been dictator, so I ended up with a few penance points,
mostly for missing peoples&rsquo; names.   We had not 1, but 3 of the can&rsquo;t-sit-still-destined-to-lose-Silent-Football types and of
those 3, Tony Salinas admitted first to having received 5 penance points.   As a result, he had to flex his pecs on
demand for the rest of the rally.
<p>
Sometime during the evening, we played a game of Psychologist.  This we played until everyone knew the secret rule
and then we started a game of Ceiling Wall Floor.  Melissa Cain and I soon chose not to play, however, believing they were messing up the game.
<p>
And then the 80s Dance Spectacular or something when everyone went to the outdoor courtyard thing to get crazy and get dancin&rsquo; and it was great.  Colored lights strung across the courtyard and cameras flashing and people dancing and other people chilling&hellip;    Nick Devereux enhanced his figure with four large balloons, though they were a bit too big for his britches.  A great time was had by all involved.
<p>
Somehow it got later and became time for the midnight worship.  Everyone lined up to go into the dining room, and we chanted two soothing repetitive repetitive chants about the 4 original elements.
Each person wrote a wish on a small piece of paper and had their hands rinsed and dried.  We sat along the perimeter
of the dining room, still chanting until everyone was in the room.   Readings were read; thoughts were said.  All the wishes
were gently burned as we meditated for our own and every other wish to come true.<br />
Each person was given a candle, and around the entire circle was passed a flame started from a candle blessed by some spiritual leader.  The candles we got to keep so that our wishes may always come true, and so that we may always remember the magic of YRUU.  Then around the circle each person received a smudge of ash from all our combined wishes.
<p>
Tears and hugs flowed freely around the room until we were all hugged out.<br />
<p>
The groups disbursed and talked until rumors of the talent show started.  I helped convert the rumors into reality and gathered everyone into the big basket ball room, nope nope wait we&rsquo;re moving to the dining hall.  The audience brought sleeping bags and pillows and snuggled up on one side of the room with me on stage on the other.
No one wanted to go first, so I began to tell a great joke.  In this case, &ldquo;great&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;hilarious.&rdquo;  I mean &ldquo;great&rdquo; as in &ldquo;huge&rdquo; or in this case, &ldquo;long.&rdquo;   The joke is too long and pointless to tell here, but it worked as I intended.  In order to stop the madness, Mike and Gabe got up to perform another fabulous, final, ad lib beat box/rap performance.
I would still pay bucks to have one on tape.
<p>
The talent show continued, starring Abby Nance and her poems, Dane Dormio and Dave (his plunger),
Melissa Cain, Susanne Kelly and Daniel Kaminsky singing a song I didn&rsquo;t know then and don&rsquo;t remember now.
Finally, Tony Salinas performed his now infamous pecs flex, amidst much clapping, cheering, and money throwing.
What a crazy time.
<p>
Groups reformed in the outdoor dance arena, this time mostly talking in small groups of friendships that will last forever.  Debe, Tera and I sat in our own group, experiencing the beginning of forever.
<p>
I started to fall asleep outside, so inside to sleep I went.  I slept way past wake up time so I could miss the clean up festivities.  Finally got up and packed up and cruised over to get a bowl of cereal and stuff.<br />
Once we were declared clean, we rounded up into the large basket ball room for closing circle.
We sang Yogi Bear, The Beaver Song, Three Chartreuse Buzzards, and with the seniors in the center for their final closing circle, Good Friends.  The beauty of the moment flowed throughout the room, when the seniors suddenly burst forth with chanting &ldquo;Bish Bish&rdquo;    If you can call screaming at the top of your lungs chanting.
<p>
Mugbooks were passed out and most everyone filed out to pile into vehicles.
But hey- we&rsquo;re in New Orleans!  Let&rsquo;s go see the sights!
<p>
So we did.  Four minivanloads full- most of the rally went to the French Quarter to see what we could see.
I had the great fortune to drive behind Arlene, in the back of whose van Dane and Dave performed for us.
It was totally hilarious, actually.  I&rsquo;m laughing as I type.  Sorry you couldn&rsquo;t be there.
<p>
We parked and walked as a group across the street where there was a tall mannequin standing on a milk crate.  He had an old ass guitar slung around him and it only had 1 string.  Pretty funny.  Then his head moved.  Wait a minute!
So we put some dollars in his box and he belted out a couple of grand songs.  The chorus was something like,
&ldquo;cause it&rsquo;s hard&hellip;!  So hard&hellip;to play a one string guitar.&rdquo;
<p>
Across the street we went again and it was declared we have 1 hour and 5 minutes until we all have to be back right here so we can get some youth to the bus station on time.   Debe Barnes, Tera Little, Arlene Dormio and I went as a group.
The coolest things we found were a voodoo shop, where Arlene bought me a braided wish ring that will make a wish come true as the ring falls off.  And this marionette dude about 2 feet tall, lip synching to some blues music.  He had on big dark shades and a dark suit.  After singing, he walked really slowly around to greet the crowd.  He gave Debe a kiss on the cheek and gave me five. (not 5 kisses on the cheek!  you know- gimme five!)
<p>
It began to rain as it was time to regroup.   We all met back up and the sky broke open and it poured.   Several of us had great fun sliding across the water soaked little pebble stone sidewalks.  I love doing that.  It was a bit tough without shoes on, but great fun.   That reminds me-  I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I would need shoes to walk around in the French Quarter, so I carried my sandals.  I never needed them.  I probably would have to go get something to eat, but just for your info- you really don&rsquo;t need shoes to go into most shops in the French Quarter.
<p>
As we were walking back to the cars, Austin Roth, Bryan Beck and I all practiced our beat box capabilities, having been so impressed with Gabe&rsquo;s the previous night at the talent show.  Oddly enough, Jason Fricke had jumped on my back piggy back style, so there we were, part of a large group of eclectic teens with chattering voices and beat boxing and soaking wet clothing and a punk looking youth with army boots on the back of a barefoot beatboxing guy with a frisbee.  Wow.
<p>
We got back to the cars and hung out and still hadn&rsquo;t gotten enough of the love from this beautiful community.  So we went to get something to eat!  Actually, Arlene had to get going back home, so we hugged them all and said our goodbyes.<br />
So we all followed Debe and, much to my pleasant surprise, went to Wendy&rsquo;s!  Yay!  I got my beloved Frosty and chicken samwich and I was set.
<p>
We ate and laughed and talked and talked and went outside and could not bear to say goodbye.  &ldquo;See ya at SWUUSI&rdquo; was the most common phrase, although it didn&rsquo;t apply to everyone.  We hugged and talked in the parking lot for fully 20 minutes.   Finally, finally, we realized we did have to go home.  What a moment.
<p>
On the way home I made it about 2 hours before I had to have Cathy some sit up front and chat with me so I could maintain an awakeful state of mind.   It torentially rained, and then it was sunny, and then it rained again and was sunny.  We got delayed by two accidents, one involving an 18 wheeler sideways on the highway, only allowing 1 land by on the left and a few cars by in the shoulder on the right.
<p>
We made it to Cathy&rsquo;s house and gave hugs and continued toward Houston.  The conversation turned to drug legalization and discussion about abusive language and finally we made it home.  John Salinas, Tony&rsquo;s dad, picked em all up- Mike Noyse, Jason Fricke and Tony Salinas.</p>

<p><p>I went inside and slept.</p>

<p><p>See ya at SWUUSI!!!!!!!</p>

<p><p>With Love<br>
- Rob</p>

                        <h1>1997 New Orleans rally review by Dane Dormio</h1>

<hr>

<p>
I have never been to the New Orleans rally before, but from what I 
have heard about it, this year's Fire-themed get-together lived up to 
the New Orleans UU church's reputation of a great rally.  This year I 
rode with my mom and brought along with me a new guy, AJ, who will be 
a fellow student with me next year at the Arkansas School for 
Mathematics and Sciences.  Dave the plunger also came along.
</p>
<p>
The drive alone took us about 8 hours, but we were held up for about 
two hours with van trouble along the way.  Nothing serious, and we 
made it the rest of the way there and back with no trouble at all.  
We forgot to bring the map to the church, so as soon as we got into 
New Orleans we stopped at a gas station and called the church, got 
its address from the answering machine, then found it not too far 
from where we were.
</p>
<p>
This rally was a lock-in, so after I got there and went inside I came 
back out and brought all my stuff in for the night.  I looked through 
all the registration forms and found out who was there, but because 
of the lateness of the hour (3:00 am) a lot of people were asleep so 
I had to wait until later that morning to see some of them.  There 
was still plenty of energy, though, and I walked into the gym to find 
a basketball game in progress.  I got my picture taken with Dave and 
Frank, then stayed up the rest of the night visiting and figuring out 
where everything was in the church.  There were about as many new 
people as there had been at Tulsa, most of them from Baton Rouge, so 
I had plenty of people to get acquainted with.
</p>
<p>
When breakfast was served I was doing something and missed it, which 
was okay because I wasn't hungry anyway.  While Nick Deveraux was 
asleep on the loveseat in the boy's sleeping room with his head 
laying back on the arm and his mouth hanging wide open, looking 
absolutely hilarious, I came in and took a picture of him.  Not much 
happened until lunch.  I greeted the people who had been asleep when 
I came in, and one time when I was standing in the hall John Thompson 
came up behind me and grabbed me, and I was very pleasantly surprised 
because I hadn't even known he was there.
</p>
<p>
Lunch was some rice stuff, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, and 
salad.  It was pretty good and not standard rally-fare, but I don't 
know what it was called.  In retrospect it seems like there was a 
little less buzzing-type energy in the air than usual, as if people 
mostly just sat around.  One time I was sitting on a bench in the 
gym looking at some pictures from Dallas and Nick Deveraux mentioned 
that everybody was just sitting around, and he would expect me, of 
all people, to be up and doing something, so I got up and attacked 
him.  We wrestled around for a few minutes until we got hot and 
sweaty.  This was just before lunch.
</p>
<p>
Sometime after lunch and before the workshops (I think) I became part 
of a pile of bodies in the boy's sleeping room, an activity which 
deserves a name, in which we managed to fit eight people onto a 
two-person love seat all at the same time.  
</p>
<p>
I did a little nail-painting in the short amount of time before the 
workshops began.  I was given misinformation about the guided 
meditation workshop and it ended right when I thought it was supposed 
to be starting.  I went to the cookie workshop instead, and I mixed 
the ingredients while Dave supervised the goings-on.  There were two 
batches, one with huge chocolate chips and one with small chocolate 
chips.  I did the mixing of the batch with the small chips along with 
help from the others.  We got the cookies in the oven and they came 
out a little crunchy but were alright.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after the workshops was dinner, excellent microwave lasagna, 
and then after that I think was a game of silent football with Rob as 
the dictator.  I may have the order of some of these events mixed up, 
but as best as I can recall I got all the important ones.  Tony lost 
silent football, and his penance was that he had to jiggle his pecs 
on demand for the rest of the rally.  The fiesta was supposed be 
next, but it wasn't much and didn't happen until after worship.
</p>
<p>
Worship was, as promised, emotionally charged (kick-ass).  It was 
held at midnight and everyone was required to participate.  We all 
lined up in the hallway and the lights were turned off, and a few at 
a time we walked down a hall lined with candles and wrote a wish on a 
piece of paper, then washed our hands in perfumed water and dried 
them before entering a room with some candles and other things in the 
center where we made a circle around the outer edge.  While we 
were doing this we were chanting a pagan song about the elements.  
When everybody got into the room, Abby did the worship-type 
speaking, and the wishes were put into a can and burned.  Some more 
worship-type speaking, and then everybody got small birthday candles 
and passed a flame of love all the way around the circle.  The ashes 
from the burned wishes were mixed with water and smeared on the 
cheeks of all the participants, with the words "May the Spirit of 
Fire be with you".  Maiah made a joke out of this by hugging 
people while turning her cheek and saying, "Kiss my ash."  After the 
official circle broke up, most of the participants stayed in the room 
and we got very emotional.  There was a lot of crying, mostly because 
of this being the absolute last, no-more-chances, this is it, we're 
not kidding, final rally of the year.  The emotions were very strong 
and the embraces were plentiful, and the love flowed freely for a 
very long time.
</p>
<p>
Eventually the mood livened up, and the lights were turned back on, 
and we were ready for the talent show.  First up I think were Gabe 
and Mike, doing their thing one last time, and then I demonstrated 
some of the many uses and talents of Dave the plunger.  He is an 
exercise partner, a self-defense weapon, a hula-hoop expert, a 
gymnast,  a great mathematician (although he is not the best public 
speaker), he can fly short distances, with a lot of patience he can 
give a huge hickey, and a few other things that I have forgotten.  
Then I did my "Oh, What a Luxury" poem from SWUUSI last year, and 
before I quit I led the rain thing where everybody makes noises in 
unison.  Then Abby read a couple of her poems, one of which won a 
national award, and Tony did the pec thing, and I can't remember what 
the rest of the acts were.
</p>
<p>
It was three a.m. by the time the talent show was over, a little 
later than usual, so most of the people who would have gone to bed 
earlier were still up.  I was ready to start up a batch of Groovy 
Juice, which I had been planning for a while, and I had recruited 
some of the best help around, but to my dismay all the things in the 
kitchen that would have made Groovy Juice were not designated for 
YRUU use, so we couldn't use them.  I was really disappointed, 
because I was going to make a special batch and dedicate it in honor 
of Anna Magwood, who couldn't be at the rally due to cruel and unfair 
employers.  Sorry, Anna.
</p>
<p>
The fiesta happened next, and as I said before it wasn't much, just 
some pretty lights strung up around the courtyard and a little music 
and dancing.  When everybody settled down sufficiently I got enough 
people together to play Psychiatrist, which hadn't been played since 
San Antonio and was due for a go around.
</p>
<p>
I stayed up until fairly late the next morning just wandering around 
and talking, and finally fell asleep in the sanctuary shortly before 
wake-up.
</p>
<p>
When we got up in the morning I struggled to maintain an upright 
position while mopping the boy's bathroom.  When we could go outside 
I carried my stuff out to the car and waited for breakfast.  Contrary 
to the norm, it wasn't doughnuts but was the usual cereal and orange 
juice.  When it was finished and mostly cleaned up, closing circle 
gathered in the gym.  We sang Yogi Bear, the Buzzard song, the Beaver 
song, and when the six seniors who were there had their circle in the 
middle we sang Good Friends.  In an exciting burst of energy the 
seniors started Bish Bish right in the middle of a verse and I joined 
in with all my might.  Then the mugbooks were handed out and we all 
went outside, but most of the goodbyes weren't said yet.  When we 
left the majority of us went downtown to the French quarter and 
acted like tourists for about an hour.  On the way there Dave and I 
got in the back of the van and entertained Rob and his youth, who 
were driving behind us.
</p>
<p>
For most of the time I walked around the French quarter I was with 
Tia, Katie, Kitty, and AJ.  We went into several shops and Tia bought 
some beads and a black boa, kitty bought a mask and a white boa, and 
I bought a red boa to go along with the rally shirt and another 
tee-shirt that said I was a certified muff-diving instructor and had 
a big design on the back.  AJ bought one of those long skinny clamp 
things with an alligator head and a pair of black boxers with red 
peppers all over them.
</p>
<p>
We got back to where we were all supposed to meet a little earlier 
than the scheduled time, so we went into a nearby ice-cream shop and 
I shared a banana split with Tia.  About the time we were supposed to 
meet it started raining, and Gabe and Mike discovered a great 
pebble-covered sidewalk that you could run and slide a long way on, 
but my thick boots didn't do nearly as well on it as tennis shoes.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately it didn't rain for very long and we didn't get too wet.  
When we were walking back to where we had all parked Dave got 
friendly with a Lexus that pulled up to us while we were crossing a 
street.  The guy driving didn't like it too much.
</p>
<p>
We did most of our goodbyes in the parking lot, and all of the 
crying had been done the night before so they were mostly cheerful 
and happy.  When I finally got around to letting go and getting in 
the van, we drove off and the last thing I remember seeing was a 
picture-perfect memory that will probably stick in my mind as long as 
I live:  looking out the back window, I saw Gabe and Mike sitting on 
some steps just hanging out, and they looked so content in the 
perfect scenery, with the wet trees and the dim cloud darkened sky.  
There is really something special about two guys who are such good 
friends for so long.  It was a perfect way to remember the last time 
I saw them.
</p>
<p>
So another rally is ended, and another day, and another review, and 
another chapter in the book of life, and that is the way it is must 
be.  A peaceful goodbye, y'all, and see you in three weeks for 
SWUUSI.
</p>
<p>
With much Love,
</p>
<p>
Dane Allen Dormio and Dave the Plunger

                        <h1>1997 Tulsa rally review by Rob Nugen</h1>

<hr>

<p><p>
Wow.
<p>
9 hours is not so bad if you have 3 drivers.  However, it&rsquo;s kinda cramped
when you have 8 people in a 7 passenger minivan.  But for a rally, we&rsquo;ll
do anything.  On the way up from Houston to Tulsa were 3 advisors: Rob Nugen
(that&rsquo;s me), Wende Whitlock, and Dierdre Hammons, and 5 youth: Mike Noyse,
Charlotte Benbenek-Price, Jon Whitten-Lege, Tony Salinas, and April Ambrose.
That is an unusually high ratio of advisors to youth, but no one seemed to mind.
<p>
We left Houston at around 3pm and got to Tulsa at like 12:30am.  Surprisingly,
we were not the last group to show up.  A lot of the youth from Tulsa were all
rally virgins, so I knew none of the first people who ran screaming up to greet
us.  Some of the youth knew each other, though:  Mike Noyse said to someone,
&ldquo;oh hey- you remember those shoes you gave me 2 years ago and I said I would
give you 20 bucks for them?  I&rsquo;ve got the 20 bucks.&rdquo;  We joked about him instead
concluding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the shoes.&rdquo;
<p>
Inside we registered and posed for mugbook pictures and talked and played a
huge game of Twister where they had 12 Twister mats all spread across the floor
and various people twisting across the mats.  We played fooz ball, pool, ping
pong and talked and goofed around until a line of people holding hands began to
snake through the two rooms and collect people on its ever-lengthening tail until
the entire rally was a long hand-holdin&rsquo; line walking outside
to the large dining hall
for opening circle.<br />
<p>
We circled and opened the rally by each person asking a personal question of the
person to his or her right, who introduced him or herself and answered the
questions.  I was asked (by Mike Moren, I think) &ldquo;what is the worst
pick-up line you&rsquo;ve used?&rdquo;  I said I don&rsquo;t have any pick-up lines&ndash;I
just charm people with my smile,
which understandably illicited many groans from the rest of the group.
<p>
After opening circle, we cruised back to the main building and had touch group
meetings.  Advisors talked advisor stuff upstairs and the various youth touch
groups talked youth stuff all over the place.  Then the groups dispersed and
I went back down to the game room.  I don&rsquo;t currently remember what I did, but
I remember reminding everyone at 4am that we were supposed to be awake in 3.5
hours for the ropes course, and that I was going to bed.
<p>
Slept, got up, went outside to find Mike Noyse and Gabe Rendon creating large
sidewalk chalk drawings in the parking lot.  I don&rsquo;t know the current jargon,
but Gabe had drawn some hip hoppin&rsquo; guy flipping his middle finger right out
at you and holding a cigarette fully 4 feet long.  Pretty impressive art
for overnight sidewalk chalk drawings&hellip;
<p>
We piled everyone and everything into the cars and drove to the YMCA for a
day of fun in the sun.   First thing I did was ask the main ropes course dude
if I could go barefoot on the course.  He said, &ldquo;no sir.  You may walk anywhere
you want on the ground without shoes, but not on the course.  There may be a
wire pulled loose from one of the cables, and it could stab you pretty well.&rdquo;
That is one good reason that I had not considered.
<p>
We tossed all our junk in the pavillion and split into two groups.  Before the
groups were split, I mentally decided to go with the group that does the low
ropes stuff first.  I determined that way I would wear my feet out to the point
that I wouldn&rsquo;t mind wearing shoes on the course.  I was correct.  But don&rsquo;t
tell anyone.
<p>
We played several games.  The coolest 5 that I remember are<br>
<ol>
<li><b>Mafia</b> Where the group makes a circle and copies the motions that the
gang boss is making in order to conceal the identity of the boss.
IT, the detective,
tries to determine who&rsquo;s the boss.</li>
<li><b>Multiple Dodgeball</b> (I made that name up) where the whole group runs around
and tries not to get hit by any of many balls being thrown around.  If you are hit,
you have to kneel down until whoever tagged you is hit, and then you can get up and
play again.  It&rsquo;s quite a fun and tiring game.</li>
<li><b>Hackey Ball</b> (I made that name up) Using the same balls, we tried to
keep them from hitting the ground.  We were allowed to use our hands, but only
got points for not using our hands.</li>
<li><b>Lava</b> (I made that name up)  We were split into two groups and each group
was given 4 small pieces of carpet.  We had to get everyone across the lava (grass)
without touching the lava, or leaving pieces of carpet unattended.</li>
<li><b>Rope Crossing</b> (of course I made that name up) We had to get the entire
group over a rope without touching it, but with each member of the group always touching
at least one other member of the group.  I got to jump over first, and we developed
a technique where basically people were lifted up onto my back and slid down (hopefully)
into the arms of the group.  I used Dane Dormio and someone else as stable bases on the
opposite side of the rope and we tossed everyone over.  Quite fun.  Curtis MacCormack
completed the process by jumping over the rope and doing a half-twist to make it
look cool.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Then it was time for lunch.
<p>
We ate and played frisbee a bit and I climbed all over the swingset.  The break was
not tremendously long before it was time for our group to do the high ropes course
stuff.  Yay!!
<p>
Bud was our main adult leader dude, and he showed us the ropes, and everything we
would need to know about them.
<p>
&ldquo;Spotter ready?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Spotter ready.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Climbing?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Climb on!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
Up the first pole and then walk up the next slanted log, then climb some more to the
next horizontal log.  Walk across the horizontal log being careful not to hurt the
leaves of the tree branch brushing across it.  Then
<p>
&ldquo;Transfering!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer On!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
and you switch to the next safety rope thing.
<p>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;<br>
And you show &lsquo;em.<br>
&ldquo;Squeeze me!&rdquo;<br>
And you squeeze &lsquo;em.<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
And you jump/step across to a suspended lily pad thing and
across to a stable platform and switch to the next rope thing.
<p>
&ldquo;Transfering!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer On!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Squeeze me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
And then along a long long single cable with ropes hanging above
it about 5 feet long and 5 feet apart.  They call this section the
grape vine, and it was the first where
you actually step on a single cable, and I quickly realized I was
glad to be wearing my shoes.
<p>
&ldquo;Transfering!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer On!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Squeeze me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
And then along the &ldquo;Charlie Chaplin&rdquo; lines, two parallel cables that you
kinda shuffle across.  The right foot cable hung several inches lower than
the other, so I just used the left cable.
<p>
&ldquo;Transfering!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer On!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Show me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Squeeze me!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Transfer complete!&rdquo;<br>
<p>
And along the last cable, with a cable about 3.5 feet above it as a handle.
It was about 60 feet long.<br>
At the end of this set of cables was Pam, sitting on a platform about 40 or 50
feet in the air helping people switch to the last safety rope, the one for the
zip cord.  I talked to her for a few minutes, asking about her work and stuff.
I yelled stuff like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared!&rdquo; to the people at the bottom waiting for me
to zip, and did a one foot shakey wavey dance to show how off balance and nervous
I was (not).  I appreciated the view for a moment and then gave Pam a hug.
&ldquo;Thank you, Pam, for all your help out here.&rdquo;
<p>
&ldquo;Clear??&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Clear!!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Zipping??&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Zip On, BA-BYYY!!!!<br>
<p>
And jump and zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!
down the long long long cable 35 m.p.h. upside down past the people at the bottom
and slow then backwards upside down zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz past them again and then
crazy legs sideways zzzzzzzz past them again and then zzz and grab the rope and
attach it to my cable and stop and unhook and down the ladder safely to the ground.
<p>
Wild awesome fabulous fun.
<p>
I helped out with the group helping people get down off the zip line until I
helped Wende go through the ropes course itself.  There was a delay, so she had
to stay up there a bit longer than most people.  I yelled, &ldquo;Wende!  Yell, &lsquo;Chilling!&rsquo;
so I can yell, &lsquo;Chill On!&rsquo;&rdquo;  but she didn&rsquo;t think that was very funny.
<p>
After everyone had gone, we cruised back to the pavillion and chilled.
Soon, the pool was open, so we got to go play in the pool.  Yay!  I mostly
played a game of Marco Polo with Frank Roesler, Dane Dormio, Nick Grunewald,
Mike Moren, and a few others but I don&rsquo;t remember who.  (it&rsquo;s been too long since
the rally!)  We got bored of &ldquo;Marco&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;Polo&rdquo; so we started doing all
variety of name associations from people first and last names, to days of the
week, to articles of clothing, to song lyrics, to record labels.  Crazy..
<p>
We got bored of the whole game, though not quite as bored, I&rsquo;m sure, as the life
guards, and went to eat, because it was dinnertime!  Yay!
<p>
We ate and
I grabbed my frisbee and went to the basketball court and we got a game of
frisbee going.  I was glad for the chance to help a few youth learn how to throw
and for a few other youth to throw better.  I love that.  We played for probably
an hour or hour-na-half and it was great.
<p>
Worship was awesome, though difficult to hear over the crackling of the fire
and singing of some youth.  We did a round of Unreturned Love (that&rsquo;s not what
it&rsquo;s called but I can&rsquo;t remember the name) where half the group stands with
eyes closed and the other half walks around and hugs everyone.  Then the sides
switch and you do it again.  It&rsquo;s great; I&rsquo;ll suggest we do that at SWUUSI.
<p>
We cruised back to the church and hung out until time for the Love Feast.
This one was held outside and was much more gentle and sane than the
notorious New Orleans Love Feast turned Food Fling Festival from last year.
I ate a crazy mixture of cheese, M&amp;Ms, carrots, crackers, fruit, over and over
until I was just barfily full.  Thanks to everyone who helped.
<p>
Back inside we chilled more, until some people suggested
getting together a talent show.  Unfortunately, as I was walking around
inviting people to the show, I got pulled into a hasty meeting.<br />
Some youths had broken the no smoking rule and we had to figure out what
to do.  Shit.  I did not want to deal with the situation, but we
decided what would be appropriate and talked to the youths in question
and told them their punishment and blah.  Done.  I hate having to do that.
<p>
Soon thereafter, I was invited to a game of Truth or Dare.  Oh no.<br />
My better judgement said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t play&rdquo; but I did anyway.  We had fun.
I won&rsquo;t name names, and in fact, I won&rsquo;t even say what happened.
You&rsquo;ll have to ask.  It wasn&rsquo;t as bad as you&rsquo;re thinking.
<p>
Okay, fine.  One youth got a swirly, one youth got naked (alone)
in the elevator,
one youth put their underwear in the middle of the circle, and
then I had to go get some sleep.
<p>
We got up, cleaned up, packed up, and had closing circle.  The
seniors had senior circle in the middle, and then we all did a big tight
spiral hug around them.  Nice.
<p>
Muffins and juice for the ride home and we left.<br>
I talked to Charlotte Benbenek-Price about Marilyn Manson.  We wondered
about the band and about Mr Manson&rsquo;s motivations for things.  <br>
I was introduced to Type O-Negative, a cool group that my brain
is thinking had a sound like a smooth industrial, ambient mix.<br />
Fun stuff.
<p>
Also weird was Ben Atkinson&rsquo;s Bizarre magazine.  I&rsquo;m glad my small
part of the world does not include some of the crazy stuff in there.
<p>
Have a great day!<br>
- Rob</p>

                        <h1>1997 Tulsa rally review by Dane dormio</h1>

<hr>

<p>Well, two years, twelve rallies and two SWUUSIs later, I finally
got to go back to the site of my first rally, the All Souls UU
church in Tulsa.  I&rsquo;m sure anyone who has been going to rallies for a
while will understand how special a place this was for me.  It was
great to see the old church again and think about how completely
different a person I am now than I was then.  All the familiar sights
were etched in my memory, and it seemed like nothing had changed.  A
wonderful experience.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Other than that, I must admit, I expected the Tulsa &lsquo;97 rally to be
the only bad one I had ever been to.  Boy, was I wrong.  It was a
very non-standard rally experience and will definitely stand out
among the rest in the future.  One non-standard thing was, of course,
the notorious anti-smoking rule.  Both sides of this battle deserve
to be commended:  the Tulsa church for standing up and saying &ldquo;No
Smoking&rdquo; (that took a lot of guts), and the smokers who came anyway
and put up with the rule with very little friction.  But there were
also other things that made this rally different.  It was probably
the smallest one I&rsquo;ve ever been to; I would estimate about 40 people
were there, give or take a few.  It seemed like at least a quarter of
these were rally virgins from Tulsa.  I had no idea they had such a
large youth group.  There was also a Love Feast, which is rare.<br />
Then, of course, there was the church it was in, which is a big thing
in itself.  And, probably the most unusual, the R.O.P.E.S. course at
the YMCA that took up most of the day Saturday.  What a rush!
</p>
<p></p>

<p>For me, one other thing that made this rally unique was an
extra-special friend I made Thursday night who came with me:  Dave,
the plunger.  Sure, he&rsquo;s non-human, but non-human objects are
people too, and most people take for granted just how much life,
warmth, and personality plungers can have when you look at one of
them carefully enough and give it a fair chance.  All they want is to
be treated equally and given the love that any other person would
expect, not for their physical appearance alone, but for what a
beautiful, twinkling, caring soul lies within the flimsy rubber
shell.  Dave is a true plunger pioneer, and he had a lot of fun at
the rally and made a lot of good friends.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>My mom couldn&rsquo;t come to this rally, so Dave and I rode in a van with
Gene Hudnall, Nick Grunewald, Helen Cole, and Gene&rsquo;s mom Sheila, all
from Little Rock.  About the time we got into Tulsa, we realized that
none of us had bothered to bring a map to the church, which was no
big deal because a nice man at a gas station knew right where it was.
It was relatively early when we arrived, a little before ten o&rsquo;clock,
and the only people there were Tera Little and her two YUUTEs from
Fayetteville, Andy and Laura Andrews from Tyler, TX, Ben Atkinson, who
had flown in, and a large number of people from the Tulsa youth
group.  Getting to rallies early is a mixed blessing; you get to meet
everyone else as they arrive, but you have to wait, at a time when
you are about to explode with happy energy.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Eventually people arrived from Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and OKC,
and opening circle was postponed half an hour to wait for the
stragglers because there were so few of us.  For the ice breaker,
everyone in the circle asked the person to his or her right a
get-to-know-you question, and that person answered, and it went all
the way around.  Then everything for tomorrow was explained, all the
rules, boundaries, etc.  When we were dismissed, we all went
back to the main part of the church and had touch group meetings.<br />
There weren&rsquo;t really any big, clear rooms where there was a lot of
space to run around, so the general partying was more mild than
usual, and people either sat on any of the numerous couches or played
pool or ping-pong.  There was also the art wall in the Sponge Room,
which had been painted over since the last rally, and it was soon
totally covered in magic-marker graffiti.  Since the group was so
small, the atmosphere was less energetic, but no less cheery, than
normal.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>In the morning breakfast was cooked and eaten, and shortly
afterwards everyone piled back into their vehicles and we all
caravanned to the Westside YMCA for a day of fun in the trees.  </p>
<p></p>

<p>As soon as we got there, the six touch groups were divided up and
three were taken directly to the R.O.P.E.S. course while the other
three played rally-variety games in a grassy field.  Dave and I were
in the latter group, so we spent the first hour or two running around
in the sun playing while the other group was gliding through the
trees.  We had a little bit of fun and learned a few fun new games,
like a weird form of dodge ball which will probably be played again,
but most of the time I would have rather just sat in the shade.  It
was hot!  We took a long break for lunch, then went back to playing
games.  The last thing we did was try to get everyone over a rope
strung between two trees.  The drawback was that we couldn&rsquo;t touch
the rope, and everyone had to be touching someone else the whole
time.  Rob was our pillar of strength for this little exercise;
he leaned out over the rope and as we handed them over he let the
whole group slide down his back to a gaggle of waiting arms on the
other side, one person at a time.  Curtis was the last one over, and
touching Rob across the rope he did an effortless little hop/spin
right over, completing the exercise.  Impressive.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>We took a second, shorter break to eat, drink, and rest before
heading up to the R.O.P.E.S. course.  There we were given a crash
course on all the procedures and things we would need to know in
order to not die.  It was fairly simple once you got the hang of it.
After watching a few other people go before me, it was my turn to don
the safety rope and climb the pillar.  Dave stayed behind and
watched, because the course was too dangerous for plungers, and he
had plenty to keep him busy besides.  The first thing I did was hook
the safety line to the loop on my harness, then I climbed up the
thick wooden pole with my spotter Tom making sure I didn&rsquo;t fall.<br />
Just like I had seen it done before, I walked out across the log,
just as calm as could be.  About halfway across, though, I started to
think about what I was doing and was hit by a twinge of nervousness.<br />
I pushed it out of my mind and tried to be as relaxed as possible
from then on.  I got to the end of that one and climbed up to the
next one, and walked across it to the starting platform.  I changed
safety lines, then hopped out onto the wobbly &ldquo;lilly pad&rdquo; suspended
thirty feet in the air, and bounded across to the next platform.  I
changed safety lines again, then started across a twenty-to
thirty-yard open stretch, balancing on a single wire and using my
safety line to hold myself up and pulling myself across by ropes that
were dangling every few feet.  I made my wobbly way across and hugged
the next pole as soon as it was within reach.  I crawled around it
and stood on the two wires running out from the other side to change
safety lines again, then made my way across them about ten feet in
the same manner as I had gone across the other wire.  This one didn&rsquo;t
have the suspended ropes, and it was a little more wobbly, but it
wasn&rsquo;t nearly as long as the first stretch so it was easier.  At the
end of it was another platform where I changed safety lines again and
took off on another set of wires.  These were three wires running one
above the other, and they turned to the right at a 90 degree angle
to the wires I had just navigated.  My feet were balancing on the
bottom wire, my safety line was attached to the top one, and I was
holding onto the middle one to keep myself up.  That stretched out
for about another twenty or thirty yards, and when I got off it, Pam,
one of the YMCA adults running the course, helped me onto her
platform and I put the zipper line on and shucked my old safety line.
When everything was clear, I jumped off the platform and went
whizzing down through the air at all the people, and zipped past them
at a breezy 35 m.p.h.  I ran out of momentum and flew back a little
slower, then cycled by a third and fourth time, and the fourth time I
was going slow enough that I could grab a rope from someone on the
ground and pull myself over to the ladder and climb down.  The wind
had cooled me off nicely, and I sat at the shady picnic table with
Dave and waited for everybody else to finish.  The course was unfair
to Rob, because he had to put shoes on for it, but he did it anyway.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>The rest of the evening was free time.  The pool didn&rsquo;t open until
six, so people found other ways to pass the time until then.  Food
was being served all the time, and there was much more than enough of
it.  I started to go canoeing with Nick Grunewald, but when I got
there I found out that the &ldquo;pond&rdquo; was nothing but an oversized puddle
of slightly diluted mixed animal waste products that probably had a
microbial count of fifteen billion deadly, germy, sharp-clawed and
pointy-teethed, highly infectious, very very mean and out-to-get-me
unpleasant organisms per cubic milliliter, and all they wanted was
just a chance to touch a single skin cell and invade my body and
liquefy my brain and internal organs, rot out my bowels, and turn my
skin into stone.  Not to mention the rather offensive odor.  Dave and
I left right away.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Later hamburgers and veggie burgers were cooked, and all the usual
cookout food.  There were people playing on the playground, playing
basketball, and just sitting around the pavilion talking.  When the
pool opened, quite a few people got in and swam.  Dave sat on the
side and soaked up the mild evening sun, because he is not the best
of swimmers, although he does do a really good impersonation of a
jellyfish underwater.  (Dave is a plunger of many hidden talents.<br />
For instance, he is a hula-hoop expert.)  I played Marco Polo with a
large group of people for quite some time.  To make it more
interesting, we used a few new techniques that Nick Grunewald came up
with:  Submarine, where you could open your eyes underwater and move
around, and Radar, where you could open your eyes above water but you
couldn&rsquo;t move.  When I was It, I made it a personal challenge to
catch Rob, who&rsquo;s hair had grown out a little bit since Ft. Worth, but
somehow, I kept ending up with Nick instead. One time I
grabbed somebody and thought I had finally gotten ahold of Rob and I
was doing a victory yell, but when I opened my eyes I saw I had Mike
Moren instead.  By the way, Rob, your hair looks really cute like
that; just long enough to cover your head.  You should keep it that
length.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>We were the last ones in the pool, staying until well after dinner
had officially been served.  We all walked back to the pavilion
together and ate, and the evening was getting on when I went
swimming again at about 9 o&rsquo;clock.  Besides me and Dave in the pool,
there was also BEN Atkinson and Kim Strouble.  Later Bryan
Beck came and told me how silly I was to be in the pool with my jeans
on, but I guess my hypnotic body language had a profound effect on
him, because in a few minutes he did the same thing.  Stacy came in
for a little while, and it was about fifteen minutes before ten when
we finally left.  It was, of course, dark, and almost time for
worship to start.  At ten thirty we all walked in a line down a trail
to where the park employees had set up a big bonfire for us.  We
surrounded it in a circle, and I stood as close to it as I could
endure so my jeans would dry out.  The worship was put on by Emily
Stainer, and it was something I had never seen before which was
similar to a whispering circle, except here the emphasis was more on
touching and feeling than speaking.  It was an exercise in
unconditional love.  The circle was divided in half, and first one
side closed its eyes and the other side moved over to it while
everybody loved on and said nice things to the people with their eyes
closed, who were not allowed to respond in any way.  Then the circle
reformed and the sides switched.  My side was doing the loving first,
and I took my time and gave a warm, personalized verbal love note to
everybody I loved on, so I only got to about half of them before time
ran out.  Then I went back to my spot near the fire and tried to keep
my eyes closed while I got loved unconditionally, but I couldn&rsquo;t help
peeking a few times.  Once somebody played with my nipples, and
once somebody gave me a short, soothing backrub then stuck his
wet finger in my ear (gee, I wonder who that could have BEN?!), but
it was all friendly and pleasant.  It was over too soon, then we got
with our touch groups and each of us found a twig.  The twigs were
supposed to represent a challenge which we had either in the past,
present, or future, one we had overcome or gained ground on, or were
still fighting with.  We shared the challenge with our touch group if
we wanted, then the twigs were gathered up and tied into a bundle
which was gathered into the larger community bundle, which was thrown
into the fire and we had a long moment of silence while it burned.
Then we were asked again to share our challenges with the whole group
if we wanted.  My challenge was growing up.  That has always been my
challenge, and just recently in my life I realized it, and I have
actively been making it my goal, even though I know I&rsquo;ll never be
finished.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Before we broke up we all got close and sang Good Friends, then when
everybody else left I stayed behind and stood close to the fire
because my pants were still wet and by sheer luck I made a new friend
in the process.  When we thought everybody else was getting ready
to leave, we walked away slowly and sat down a distance away from the
fire.  In just a couple of minutes two of the park employees walked
by us dragging a hose to put the fire out with.  They started
drenching the once-grand fire and I couldn&rsquo;t stand to look at it, so
since they couldn&rsquo;t see me I reached out and kinked the hose.  A
worthless gesture, I know, but just to mess with them I kinked it and
unkinked it several times at irregular intervals before I got up and
walked away.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>At rallies most people go through emotional phases, and this was the
time during the rally when I was a little sluggish and very patient,
when I took my time doing everything and had that wonderful, content
feeling where my heart swells up and I love everybody so much that I
would be happy no matter what was going on around me and I just want
to hug and love and linger on every person that I see.  A bad time
for this to happen, because the other people in my van were in a
hurry to leave so we could follow the caravan back to the church.  I
took my time and walked slowly getting my stuff back into the van and
we were the last ones to leave.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>As soon as I got back to the church, Dave and I had to go help
prepare the food for the Love Feast.  We cut up a watermelon which
turned out to be no good, but we had other watermelons and there
was plenty of food anyway.  My touch group prepared apples,
watermelon chunks, bananas (not the best fingerfood), cheese,
goldfish, gummi bears, M&amp;Ms, chocolate chips, baby carrots,
and crackers, and we carried them all outside to the parking lot and
got everybody together for the Love Feast. This was the first Love
Feast I actually attended, and the first one at a rally I have been
to.  It wasn&rsquo;t the best place to walk around in bare feet, especially
with the gummi bears and bananas, but I enjoyed myself still.  When
we were feeding each other a guy drove up in a BMW.  He was visiting
one of the Tulsa youth while on his way to work.  He must have been
in a hurry, because when we tried to feed him, he wouldn&rsquo;t eat
anything, and shortly he drove away very fast.  He didn&rsquo;t even stick
around long enough to meet Dave, but that was OK because Dave has a
lot of friends anyway.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>After the Love Feast by some chance I didn&rsquo;t have to clean up, so I
went back inside and hung out in the sponge room.  Stevie Williams
gave me a wonderful picture of Dave she had drawn, which he will
cherish forever, so I asked her to draw one on the wall for everyone
else to remember him by.  I didn&rsquo;t try very hard to stay awake that
night, and I went to sleep after a while on one of the couches.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>When I woke up in the morning the lights in the sponge room were off
and I was being tormented by really terrible stomach pains, probably
because of a tray full of chocolate chips that Nick Grunewald had
poured down my gullet at the Love Feast the night before.  Before
long I was talkin&rsquo; to Ralph on the big white telephone.  After having
four distinct conversations, I clunked heavily back into the Sponge
Room, where people were now moving around getting ready, and
collapsed on the floor. Though I had bowed faithfully to the
porcelain god he had not answered my prayers and I was still very
sore.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>While I was lying on the floor in the sponge room, Jon
Witten-Lege informed me of my somnambulist activities the
night before.  According to him, I had gotten up from where I was
lying on the couch and mumbled some indecipherable sounds.  I had
walked over to where the couch right beneath the bulletin board that
said &ldquo;The Sponge Room&rdquo; sat and molested the feet of the person who
was sleeping there (I think it was Frank Roessler), possibly as an
indulgence of my foot fetish.  Then I had walked over to Jon and
mumbled some more gibberish (now that I think about it I was probably
trying to say something like, &ldquo;Ouch, my stomach&rdquo;).  He had tried in
vain to communicate with me, and then he had asked me, &ldquo;Dane, are you
asleep?&ldquo;, and I had said, &ldquo;Yyyyyeeeeeeessssss&rdquo;.  Then I had gone back
to my couch and lain down again.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Eventually I had to get my stuff and move out to the
hallway in front of the door, because the Sponge Room was being
cleaned and it was raining outside.  I almost hurt too bad to move,
but it was fun watching while other people scurried around cleaning.<br />
I fell asleep for a little while and when I woke up I was feeling
significantly better, although whatever it was that I had is still
bothering me a little as I write this.
</p>
<p></p>

<p>Breakfast was bagels and juice, served right before closing circle.<br />
There were six seniors at the rally, and they formed a circle in the
middle and started a not-too-enthusiastic round of Good Friends,
which the rest of us joined in on.  While it was going they faced
outwards and we all did a spiral hug around them.  Then we let them
out and did the usual emotional goodbye.  Mugbooks were not given out
at the rally, because the film hadn&rsquo;t been developed in time, so they
will be mailed out later, which is something I&rsquo;ve heard about but
never experienced in two years of rally life.  So goodbye guys, love
ya, see you in New Orleans.
</p>
<p>
Yo,
Dane and Dave</p>

                        <h1>1997 Fort Worth rally review by Rob</h1>

<hr>

<p>Driving up from Houston in my truck were just Cathy Saur and
myself.<br>
The entire way up there we talked about what is most important
in the world.  The discussion resulted
in us defining 4 types of love:<p>
<ol>
<li> Love, the emotion, that people have when they fall in love
with other people.  This is the type of love people usually mean
 when they say, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</li>
<li> Love, the non-love, when people love things that are
inanimate.  &ldquo;I love that dress!&rdquo;  &ldquo;I love that picture!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I love to ski.&rdquo;</li>
<li> Love, the instinct, which all humans intrinsically have for
 all other humans.</li>
<li> And Rally Love, that amazing thing that allows us to form
greater relationships in one weekend than in a whole semester in school.   Incredible!</li>
</ol>
I believe the most important thing in the world is to love yourself and everyone else, and I think the
perfect life for me would be to &ldquo;walk the earth&rdquo; like Jules in Pulp Fiction and love so many people that I wouldn&rsquo;t need money to live- just be a bum, but not begging for money, just being helpful and
getting a place to sleep in return.      <br>
Really.  That would be cool.<p>
We drove the entire way nonstop once we got out of Houston rush hour traffic.<p>
Walked into the rally and upon seeing my short short haircut (1/8th inch all over), James Meine said,
&ldquo;can I lick it?&rdquo;   I said sure&hellip;.  Rally Love.<p>
We played hackysack &amp; skateboarded around the big flat hard concrete sanctuary, after playing with a weird plus-shape green flying foam thing until one of its arms was ripped off.   I got out my Ballzack, basically a big cloth beach ball.  We knocked it around for quite a while and soon developed a game we called Deadball.  Essentially the same rules as Ultimate.  We played that until dog tired 5:30AM and I lay down and slept about 30 minutes in the movie room, where they were watching <em>Holy Grail</em>.  I got back up and played hackysack with the few remaining players.  I did better than usual, though we were all obviously tired.  We played Deadball again as the sun was coming up.  At 7AM or so I slept 2 hours until breakfast at 9.<p>
Adam Lock and I went outside and tossed the frisbee around and practiced various types of throws.  After a couple other people came out, I went in to check the schedule and talked to Bernest Cain, Melissa&rsquo;s dad, and then went to the Sexuality Workshop.
The workshop was cool; I learned that babies must be lovingly touched or they will die.  Wow.<p>
During lunch I sat with Gabe Rendon and Mike Noyse and asked them about Wu-Tang Clan, to understand what/why/whatever about the &ldquo;lyrics&rdquo; describing graphic ways of torturing people.  I decided that it can be seen as a form of humor in that it&rsquo;s exaggerating stupid hurtful thing people have done.  And as a game to see who can gross the other out.   hmm.<p>
After that, we got a group together and played Ultimate out in the field.  It was super great fun.  I hope the youth had as much fun as I.  The game ended as PM workshops started.<p>   I attended the workshop that showed the <em>Powers of Ten</em> video and then had discussion afterward.  Great discussion afterward about &ldquo;what kind of a difference can we make at this particular magnitude of life?&rdquo; and  &ldquo;why life anyway?&rdquo;  or &ldquo;why sentience and self awarness?&rdquo; and we talked about the structure of the universe.  Pretty interesting stuff.     I described briefly the experiences of one man who has had 2 near death experiences, and how he believes the most important thing in the world is for each individual to be responsible for his or her own actions.<p>
Soon after the workshop, I described to Gavin, et. al. the flatland universe big bang, and how the book <em>Stalking the Wild Pendulum</em> described the universe as continuously big banging and continuously big crunching.  (Don&rsquo;t worry; it didn&rsquo;t make any more sense when I described it than as I&rsquo;m typing it here.)<p>
Then we cut about 4 variations of mobius strips with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, 1, and 1&amp;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> twists.  Cool.<p>
I talked to Aisha, who has been to 9 SWUUSIs but this was her first rally.  She said she felt a bit out of place, so I asked if she would play a game if I got one started.  She would, so I did.<br>
We played the Zoo Game and it degenerated to a slow motion version  of the game with people all playing really slowly, taunting the other players and making the game suck.  I singled out 1 person as slowness instigator and I asked him privately to play more enthusiastically- to actually run and try to play&hellip;  He did better and that helped but people were still playing apathetically&hellip;<p>
My belief is that by playing enthusiastically, the game thrives; it becomes more enjoyable for all involved.  By playing the other way, people were actually sucking energy out of the game and out of the other players (read <em>Celestine Prophecy</em> to see what I&rsquo;m talking about).<p>
Unfortunately, the only way I knew to explain this was to adamantly tell people &ldquo;play better, play harder blah blah blah&rdquo; and then (more unfortunate) for me to RUN and play to the point it was too hard for some players, and made at least one not want to play.   This was not working out at all and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do.    Fortunately, &ldquo;dinner is ready!&rdquo; was shouted into the room, and everyone vanished, except for me; I collapsed onto the comforting cold concrete floor to recover some energy.<p>
In the dinner line, I asked a few people if I played too hard.<br />
I had, so next time we play, I will explain logically why we
might want to play passionately instead of otherwise.<br />
(Zoo Gamers, be ready!)<p>
During dinner we had the YAC candidates run for election and I
ran for the adult position, and I got it!  My term officially
starts at SWUUSI this year.  Yayyy!!<p>
After dinner I talked with other adults who had congregated at
one table and told them about the web page, and we brainstormed
stuff to put on it.<p>
Then we had the dance, then the YAC transfer of
power/description of accomplishments meeting, then the talent
show<p>
Much to my pleasant surprise, when I jokingly started the talent show with the Fuck You Clown Joke, everyone was like, &ldquo;yeah yeah!! tell it!&rdquo;   So I did.  Tera Little apparently hadn&rsquo;t heard it before and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s <em>terrible</em>!&rdquo; when I sat down.<p>
Then Kristian Scott, Dane Dormio, and I performed &ldquo;Dead Puppies.&rdquo;
  Dane sang, Kristian fingered the chords on the guitar, and I
strummed the guitar and laughed because it truly was terrible.<br />
We had great fun, though.<p>
Then Gabe Rendon and Mike Noyse performed with Gabe doing beat
box and Mike rapping and I was envious at how well Gabe can
beatbox and I could practically hear the deep mega low ultra
bass woofers and hear and see the scratch as they danced around
the stage and performed so passionately loving and beautifully
ad libbed the whole thing!  How do they do it???  I would pay 50
bucks to have it on tape.
(Gabe, Mike, you listenin?)<p>
Then I fell asleep.<p>
Then my first YAC meeting as a YAC member and we decided what
positions people will have and what overall goals we have for
YAC this year.<p>
Then Silent Football until 2am or so.  How nice it was to sit
by Carina Dormio and play nicely instead of always play fighting
as we had done in the past.<p>
Then Tera Little and I stayed up until 4AM yackin&rsquo; about life,
love and everything.   Julie Sexton sat with us, until I was
literally falling asleep while sitting up.  Time for bed.<p>
Slept until around 7am when the funniest thing was hearing Debe
Barnes holler in her sleepy voice to someone trying to wake us
up, &ldquo;is it clean yet??  Don&rsquo;t wake me up until the church is
clean!&rdquo;  That was hilarious.<p>
That morning, I realized that Shawn McDaniel, who went to
rallies with me back in the good ol&rsquo; days, had been there the
whole weekend knowing it was me and just waiting for me to
realize it.  Wow!!  We swapped emails and reminisced and it was
great.  <p>
I took a long time hugging everyone, and especially all the
seniors as everybody was leaving.  I will miss them all.  <p>
Drove home and Cathy slept the entire way.  I slept for 30
minutes after we arrived at the church until her parents got
there and knocked on the truck window.  Got home and slept.<p>
Great rally.<p>
With Love<br>
Rob</p>

                        <h1>1997 Ft Worth rally review by Dane Dormio</h1>

<hr>

<p>Ft. Worth, rally number eleven for me, and the last one for a lot of
seniors.  This fact perhaps made it a little more emotional than
most.  At the end, though, I was surprised that almost nobody cried.<br />
Last year, I remember, there was a lot of crying at the end.  I was
told that by the time it&rsquo;s time for seniors to leave, they are about
ready to move on anyway.  I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s true, but I&rsquo;m also sure it
is still not easy, and I definitely don&rsquo;t look forward to it.  I
think this was a good last rally, because it had so many memorable
events.  There were no wall incidents, but hey, it&rsquo;s the small things
that count.  Things like the few hours during the day that the power
went out, and the cotton down that was constantly floating around in
the air and depositing itself in places, and the wet, sandy mud on
the playground that felt wonderful on bare feet, and yes, even the
toilet in the little boys room that overflowed and the water that
spilled out into the lobby and down the ramp into the dining room.  I
hope my last rally is as nice.  At night it was cool, but not as cold
as OKC, but during the day it was sunny bright and just warm enough.
<p>
The drive was about eight hours, relatively short for us.  The usual
four from Jonesboro, Arlene, Carina, Aaron, and myself, went, as well
as Greg Williams, a guy from our fellowship, who went as an advisor.
Four weeks seemed like a long time to wait for a rally, and I was
fully ready by the time I arrived.  I hopped out of the car and
walked inside.  I signed in and was immediately greeted
enthusiastically by Rob.  (Boy, it&rsquo;s great to finally be here.  Hey,
somebody&rsquo;s charging at me.  Oh my god, it&rsquo;s Rob.  Oh my god, he&rsquo;s
bald!  Harruuumph!  Hi, Rob.)  The greetings were as exciting and
emotional as always.  I greeted everybody and checked out the
church. It was a nice place for a rally.  They hadn&rsquo;t had one in
about three years, the Duck rally, hence the name of this one, &ldquo;Son
of Duck.&rdquo;  There was a white porcelain duck on a table with markers
for people to decorate and memorabiliaize at their leisure.  Now that
I think about it, it was a minor miracle that it did not get broken.<br />
<p>
Opening Circle happened, with a rubber duckie tossed around and duck
stories shared.  The idea was to share happy stories, but the
majority of the stories told were about ducks or ducklings getting
squashed, stepped on, eaten, incinerated, falling through sewer
grates, etc.  Then afterwards touch group meetings.  I don&rsquo;t know
about the others, but mine was pretty good.  There were a lot of good
getting-to-know-each-other questions.
<p>
The first night rolled steadily on with all the usual buzzing energy:
bouncing music and Ballzacks, the Zoo game, the invention of
Deadball, a floppy boomerang being chased, and general Tiggerish
behavior.  I decided to be a wimp and laid down to watch
&ldquo;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Crow&rdquo;.  I fell asleep for
a few hours before morning.
<p>
Breakfast was the usual, cereal and milk.  The newly-risen sun was
beautiful, drying up the dewy grass and warming the sidewalks,
accompanied by pleasant birdsongs.  When morning workshop time rolled
around, I was in the movie room and since the workshop was going to
be about sexuality, I decided to stay where I was.  It was a great
workshop, put on by a woman whom I later found out was Gary Randall&rsquo;s
girlfriend.  The first thing we did was hold up various pictures and
decide how sexual they were.  It turned out, of course, that they
were all sexual, because all people are sexual.  It was a very
informative and enlightening workshop, and I learned a little more
about what it means to be a human being.  When it was over the woman
who put it on gave me a special hug and told me I had a wonderful
mind and heart, and she wanted me to know that.  Then I picked
Nick G. up and exposed his rear for free smacks, which he got a lot
of, because he had been making bad jokes the whole time.
<p>
At lunch they served sandwiches.  I fixed a couple, then sat down and
helped put together a jigsaw puzzle.
<p>
Sometime during the day, I got around to walking back out the front
door and realized something I hadn&rsquo;t in the dark:  the cotton down
that had settled all around the front door resembled duck down, which
went along perfectly with the theme of the rally.  As the day grew
older a game of ultimate frisbee started on the big grassy field, but
I did&rsquo;t participate because I didn&rsquo;t want to run around in the sun
and get all hot and smelly.  Instead I walked across to the
playground and pulled my pants up to walk around in the puddles of
water.  I swung in the tire swing, climbed the swingset, and pushed
Emily sessions and Karen Plemons around on the merry-go-round.
<p>
I was walking back to the church and saw Kitty and Ben sitting lazily
under a tree doing nothing, so I decided to help them.  The three of
us sat on a sleeping bag for at least an hour, partaking of nature.<br />
In such a manner the afternoon passed, and the afternoon workshops
came and went.  I went back to the church eventually and hung around
for a bit, then eventually wandered back to the playground before
the day was over.
<p>
Some other things I did during that day were learn how to play
deadball, sit and have a serious talk with Brian, sit and have a
serious talk with Tia, sit and have a serious talk with Anna, and I
started to mosh to &ldquo;Antichrist Superstar&rdquo; with a few other Manson
fans, but apparently even the power company dislikes Marilyn Manson,
because shortly after the CD started the power surged for a while and
then went out.  Somebody started a rumor that a squirrel had touched
two power lines and caused the surge, and Laura Moriaty spread it, so
a mob of people went outside expecting to see a fried squirrel
hanging from the power lines, only to be disappointed when they found
out that it was just a blown transformer.  The bathrooms didn&rsquo;t have
any windows, so candles were used for them, but the power came back
on before it started to get dark.
<p>
The main attraction for the evening for several people involved a
tube of blue icing that Nick G. had found earlier.  He got a group of
people together to PHUUF my sister and smeared the blue icing all
over my face.  After a little bit of &ldquo;heavy persuasion&rdquo; we got my
sister to acquiesce, and I PHUUFed her, making sure to get the icing
in good.  Then anyone who wanted to lick it off of her got a chance.<br />
I&rsquo;m sure this was just great for my sister, who had been PHUUFED in
as many ways as are conceivable already by James and Chris.  Then,
when I went into the bathroom to wash my face off, I found a flaw in
Nick&rsquo;s plan:  blue icing STAINS YOUR FACE BLUE.  It was alright,
though, it was pretty freaky looking.
<p>
Dinner was lasagna and French bread, like at OKC, but with cookies
for desert instead of brownies.  During dinner we watched the runners
for YAC give their &ldquo;elect me&rdquo; speeches.  The ones who ran were Jeremy
Loomis-Nooris, Austin Roth, Aaron Ivener, and Rob.  After that, of
course, elections.  Then touch group meetings, for which we were
supposed to get something done, but my group must have missed
something, because we didn&rsquo;t do anything at all.
<p>
At eight o&rsquo;clock, after the touch group meetings, I went into the
movie room and laid down and watched &ldquo;The Crow&rdquo; again, because I had
missed most of it last night due to being asleep.  There was
supposed to be a dance going on in the big room, and every once in a
while someone would come in and say, &ldquo;Come on guys, come dance!&rdquo;, or
something like that.  So eventually, I got up and went into the big
room and guess what:  nobody was dancing.  So everybody just hung out
in there and eventually the dance turned into speeches by the
important people, something about YAC or the bylaws and the rally
sanctioning laws, or something serious like that.  I didn&rsquo;t pay too
much attention, being busy fighting off sleep instead.
<p>
Eventually that ended and turned into a talent show, which I sat in
on but did not pay a whole lot of attention to, except when I
was requested to sing &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo;, partly because of tiredness,
but later because Jessica Ford and I were busy trading back rubs.<br />
She did me, then I did her, and I had to top her back rub, so I
did her hands, arms, and feet too, so I took a lot longer.  I missed
two consecutive games of silent football in such a manner, as well as
a batch of groovy juice.  We paused shortly, though, to dance around
doing &ldquo;tu lakazia, nali pasa caya&rdquo; (spelled phonetically), for the
worship service.  I was so tired that I actually fell asleep a few
times while sitting up massaging her feet.  It was weird, I was aware
of what I was doing with my hands, but not of anything else.  A
strange ASC.  I eventually quit and walked around inside and out for
a while, trying to stay awake for a little while longer so I could
partake of a superior batch of groovy juice promised by Garrick and
Charles Misner, occasionally snacking on the Oreos that were set out.
<p>
I was overcome by sleep, however, before I could ever get so much as
a whiff of the superior batch.  I&rsquo;m not even sure if it ever
happened.  I was laying on the floor and sometime during my short
sleep I grabbed Garrick&rsquo;s overcoat and pulled it on top of me to
cover up with.  Something vibrating and buzzing in one of the pockets
woke me up with a start, and I got up shortly after that.
<p>
When I got up it was before six, but wake-up was not until seven,
so there was a while to wait before I could have my fun.  Linda
actually started waking people up at six forty-five, because once
they were up and looked at the schedule, it didn&rsquo;t matter if they
were pissed anyway.  I went around and did my share of the waking-up.
<p>
Clean up passed quickly, because I sat and snuggled with Anna the
whole time (don&rsquo;t worry, I don&rsquo;t usually shirk my duties).  Breakfast
was doughnuts, different kinds than just glazed, which is always
good.  Then closing circle out in the middle of the field.<br />
Bish-bish, yogi bear, the beaver song, I don&rsquo;t remember what else,
excellent mugbooks, and a senior circle.  A last minute plan of Nick
Devereaux&rsquo;s, the seniors all ran at Nick Grunewald and swept him up
and gang PHUUFed him before he ever knew what was happening.  I know
it just made his rally.
<p></p>

<p>Emotional goodbyes, a few teary ones, but people were alright.<br />
The advisors decided that the youth weren&rsquo;t getting out of the
church fast enough, so Rob and Debbie shoved everyone out the
door in an irresistible clump of bodies.  When I finally got finished
saying goodbye to all my friends, I decided to ride with Little Rock
to their church and then the rest of the way home with the rest of
the Jonesboroites.  The first few hours in the van with Little Rock
were pretty boring, but during the second half of the trip I taught
them all how to play Silent Football.  I was, of course, the
dictator, and they were all new, except for Nick G., who had played
the night before.  It took about an hour and half or so to get
everyone familiar with the rules, and then at least that long to play
a game.  It was a really good game, though, for being played in a
moving van with a bunch of beginners.  Nick G. lost, and for penance
everyone got to comb his hair, something he hates.
<p></p>

<p>And then we got to the church, I said goodbye, then I went home and
lived happily ever after.<br />

                        <h1> OKC RALLY   11-13 APRIL 1997 </h1>

<p><p>
What a drive!  I thought it was like 10 hours, so psychologically I made it
longer than it actually was- only 7.    Wende, co-advisor with me at Emerson
UU in Houston and I drove, while quietly talking or sleeping in the back were
Cathy Saur and Ben Atkinson.
<p>
Got there about 1:30 in the AM and had apparently just missed opening circle.
Lots of hugs all around, while a soap bubble gun blew big soap bubbles, music
bounced between Beastie Boys, Nine Inch Nails, and Po Tang (what is it???)&hellip;.
I got to play Pente with Karla Gilmore, which was super fun, considering I had
only met her over email, and we had already played a few games over email.  We
both won a couple of games.
<p>
Several youth and I played circle tag, where you stand in a vaguely tight
circle and touch someone, &ldquo;tag you&rsquo;re it&rdquo; and basically just tag the next
person if you get tagged.  You&rsquo;re not allowed to move your feet.  The fun thing
is when people think you&rsquo;re having a really cool discussion, and they walk up
and immediately get tagged.<br />
<p>
Also the first night we played about 4 rounds of Sardines!  Many of the doors
were locked (more than last year) so there were fewer places to hide.  First
Mike Moren hid downstairs by the utility room sink.  We sardines waited for a
while &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give them until 5:30PM tomorrow before we get up!&rdquo; but then found
out that the remaining players had quit to watch a movie.  <br>
Then Nick Carter was caught while trying to hide in a cabinet in the upstairs
kitchen.  <br>
Then Bryan Beck and Ashley Robinson hid by simply sitting in a back corner of
the main kitchen.  I found them first, and talked to Bryan about setting up a
homepage for SWD YRUU to replace Jamie Willis-Rose&rsquo; page which has great
information, but is slightly out of date.   Bryan seemed pretty keen on the
idea, so we decided to do it.<br>
Once we were found, I hid by squishing myself into a lower shelf in the
downstairs junk room, which was really cleaned out compared to last year.
<p>
I don&rsquo;t remember much else from the first night.
<p>
I slept about 45 minutes then got up and had breakfast (2 bowls of Captain
Crunch).
<p>
I went to the tie dye workshop, where I tie dyed my extra Houston Rally
t-shirt, a pair of Julie Sexton&rsquo;s socks, and Charlotte Benbeneck-Price&rsquo;s
bleached blonde hair.
<p>
Played Pente with several people through lunch, big giant Subway Sandwiches.<br />
Yummmmy.
<p>
The collage workshop was cool- we ripped out cool pictures from magazines and
glued &lsquo;em down.  I found big lipstick red lips that look quite reminiscent of
the Rocky Horror lips, and converted the words &ldquo;GOING BROKE&rdquo; and the title of
&ldquo;People&rdquo; magazine into &ldquo;OK GO Pee&rdquo;
<p>
Then I slept for about 3 hours.
<p>
Dinner and contra dancing kicked off the evening.  I really enjoyed the
dancing, much to my surprise.   And it was <em>tiring</em>!!
<p>
After that, several people played another round of circle tag, which turned
into a game of crab tag, where we were all doing crab walk scuttling around
the room tagging people.  Frank Roeslor evolved into a screeching howler monkey
galloping around on all fours.  Crab tag is pretty hard on the arms, so we
played Elbow Tag, or Link, as I remembered it being called on YRUU-L.  I had
never played before, so I just made up the rules from how I figured they should
be.  It was great fun.  Somewhere in there we played the Zoo Game (taught to us
by Stacey Hendren at Dallas Rally in February (it&rsquo;s a variation of the game
called Fruit, except it doesn&rsquo;t use a pillow).  I was Kangaroo, Keith Lawlor
was giraffe, Nick Carter was Heat Seeking Worm (or something), Kitty Rankin
was cat, Ben Muller was wolf, Tiffany Schneider was pig, Meagan Holt was
chicken, Frank(?) was zebra, Caroline Barr was her sister..  I don&rsquo;t remember
any others.
<p>
During the talent show, Karla Gilmore and I performed an ad lib version of
&ldquo;Fifty Things to do Besides Watch TV&rdquo;  That was fun.
<p>
Nick Carter and I sang to the tune of &ldquo;a few of my favorite things&rdquo;
&ldquo;These are what made OKC Rally dear,&rdquo; which is written on page 5 of Volume 1 of
The Big White Rally Book.
<p>
Mike Noyes performed a rap on the fly, with Curtis MacCormick on drum, and 3
backup rappers (I only remember for sure Samantha Nagel saying &ldquo;Ice Ice Baby&rdquo;)
<p>
Steve Feinstein played guitar and sang Dead Puppies&hellip;..Dead Puppies&hellip;.
and performed 2 songs (by Simon and Garfunkel??) with Bryan Beck.  Really nice.
<p>
Cathy Saur read a story she had written which really wrenched some emotion out
of me.  You had to be there.
<p>
Samantha Nagel did a dancing lip synch to Michael Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; with
Ethan Fowler and Elliot Tracy as backup dancers.  They were funny.
<p>
Lots more performances, but I don&rsquo;t remember them all for sure.
<p>
After the talent show was worship, consisting mainly of ceremonial foot
washing, hosted by Austin Roth.<br />
<p>
After that, Rocky Horror Picture Show was in the basement, while some youth
danced in the main hall, while I played Silent Football with several people
upstairs in the worship room.  Silent Football was great.  We played from
3am until Nick Carter, as the dictator was beginning to fall asleep at
&ldquo;oh shit 5:30&rdquo;
<p>
We slept.<br />
<p>
Then, an hour later than planned, Debe came running through the rooms with her
whistle, &ldquo;WAKE UP!! WAKE UP!!!  We only have 1 hour to be cleaned up!!!!&rdquo;
We woke up.  We cleaned up.  We did it.   I think we should try to clean up
in just 45 minutes next rally.
<p>
Closing circle was brief.  Yogi Bear, The Beaver Song, Good Friends, and
2 seniors in the center said goodbye for Karla and Heidi, who had to leave
at 5am.  Mugbooks, donuts, and see ya in Fort Worth!!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>Rob</p>

<h3>1997 OKC rally as seen through the eyes of Dane Dormio.</h3>
</center>
<hr>
We left as soon as we could Friday and stopped in Conway to pick up
Meghan Rose and Nick Grunewald.  Meghan had hurt her knee really bad
in a soccer game right after the Little Rock rally, but she was
almost healed and only had to use crutches a little.  Nick was hyper
and kept us all awake whenever he was around us.  After the rally my
mom said she had given him his Ritalin every time he was supposed
to take it, but my sister still complained.  Meghan put her hurt leg
across Nick&rsquo;s lap and mine, so besides Nick&rsquo;s antics I had a foot
fetish to indulge to help stave off boredom.
<p>
When we stopped at a gas station, Nick bought a cap gun and a bunch
of caps.  It took us about seven hours to get there, and we were only
about forty-five minutes to an hour from the church when we stopped.<br />
We had lost the map our hosts had so kindly drawn for us, so my mom
called Debbie Barnes at the church to get directions.  We got there
without any problems, except that Nick&rsquo;s el cheapo cap gun had broken
before we were half way there, but he could still shoot it, a
situation which my sister would remedy shortly upon our arrival by
tearing it apart into several separate components.
<p>
We arrived just after Fayetville, and it was them and the OKC people
that we saw first.  I affectionately said hi to Mellissa
Cain, Suzanne Kelly, Tiffany Schneider, Erin Bailey, Kitty Rankin,
Austin Roth, and Sean Murray, then did the same to the youth from
Fayetville and their advisor, Tera Little, showing off my bottle of
bubbles that I had saved from SWUUSI. (This bottle happened to be
well known) I was  really surprised to see Gavin Robins from
Fayetville, whom I had not seen since SWUUSI &lsquo;95.  He had cut off his
midback-long hair  and I was pissed.  I went inside and registered,
because it was cold, and the way touch groups were being marked was
with nail polish.  After getting my middle finger painted purple, I
ran around exchanging hugs and kisses and licks with all my friends.<br />
I found Charlotte Benbeneck-Price and did the same with her, and
after getting our picture taken together we headbanged to &ldquo;Portrait
of an American Family&rdquo; by Marilyn Manson with a few other fans until
that activity was ceased by a combination of dizziness, fatigue,
headache, requests to turn the music off, and the arrival of new
people.
<p>
I wore my White Zombie shirt with the devil on the front and &ldquo;I
went to Hell and all I got was this crummy tee-shirt&rdquo; on the back
that I got in trouble for at school.  It got plenty of laughs.  Keith
and Tia Lawlor arrived from Austin shortly and after them Bryan
Beck and Curtis Mcormack from San Antonio, but Curtis went to sleep
as soon as he came in, and I didn&rsquo;t see him until Saturday morning.<br />
Anna Magwood, Megan Holt, and Nick Carter were among the last people
to arrive and when they came in I met Anna&rsquo;s dad, Jim.  He is 6&rsquo;5 and
about 300 pounds.  I talked to him later and found out that he is a
cool guy.  He was not at all critical or biased, the way a lot of
adults I meet are.  A great UU.  He is from Canada, and he and his
family moved to Houston two (I think) years ago.  He has a degree in
paleontology and went to someplace in the arctic to do studies as a
post-graduate.
<p>
James Meine was the last person I remember arriving, a half hour
later than he should have because of car trouble not to far from the
church.  He bit my neck and said that he was going to collapse, which
is very out-of-character for him, especially on Friday night.
<p>
Opening circle was not the best ever, not very organized or official.
It broke up quickly.  I was disappointed that Dallas didn&rsquo;t show up,
but there was still a pretty good turnout; about fifty or sixty
youths and I think a total of 68, including advisors.
<p>
The general partying continued all night.  In the church&rsquo;s high
school room, which was supposed to be a 24-hour music-party-hangout
room, but which later turned into a thickly cushioned
sleep-workshop-movie room, several movies were played, including
&ldquo;Army of Darkness&rdquo;, which has to be the STUPIDEST movie I have ever
seen.  I spoofed it along with everyone else in the room, Anna&rsquo;s feet
resting in my lap and enjoying a massage.  I fell asleep during the
last half of that movie, and please forgive me, but I actually got a
few hours of sleep Friday night.  I never have slept on Friday night
before, but there wasn&rsquo;t anything better to do, so I thought I might
as well.
<p>
After breakfast, the morning workshops started.  I went to tie-dyeing
and tie-dyed some of my underwear.  This may sound weird, but now
when I&rsquo;m in the locker room in P.E. I can go, &ldquo;Hey guys, look at my
tie-dyed underwear.&rdquo;  Tia and Charlotte used the dye on their
hair.  There was also a halo-making workshop and there was supposed
to be a full contact monopoly game played with four big long
styrofoam &ldquo;noodles&rdquo;, but this didn&rsquo;t happen because everybody just
wanted to run around smacking each other with the noodles.  When I
was finished tie-dyeing, I had a noodle fight with Mike Moren, and
although I hate to brag, I must say that I kicked his ass, although
fair blows were exchanged both ways.  By the time we truced the
halo-making workshop was finished and Anna gave me a halo she had
made to wear as a victory crown.
<p>
Lunch was subs, because of the theme, &ldquo;The Rocky Horror Subway Show&rdquo;.
I rolled around and snuggled and visited until later that evening,
when I went into the high school room and laid down with Anna and
lazily spoofed some Bruce Lee movie, &ldquo;The China Connection&rdquo;, I think.
It was dubbed, and I don&rsquo;t really know what it was about, except a
couple of kung fu schools getting really pissed at each other and
really fake-looking fighting with Bruce Lee against everybody,
kicking multiple asses at once, and it was also the STUPIDEST movie I
had ever watched.
<p>
When it was getting to be dinner time, around five or six, Melissa,
who was my touch group leader, came to tear me away to do dinner
prep.  We were the only two people in the touch group to actually go
into the kitchen and work, but we had plenty of volunteer help, so it
was alright.  We made garlic bread, various microwave lasagnas, and
brownies for desert, so I got to lick the bowl with Heidi Bickner and
my sister.  Dinner was scheduled for six, but it was not finally
ready until 7:10, which seemed like it was bad because the contra
dancers were coming at 7:30, but it was really ok, some people ate
while some people danced.
<p>
I thought contra dancing (don&rsquo;t ask me why they call it that) would
be something exotic, but it was actually just square dancing, which I
guess is somewhat exotic, or at least unusual, to me because I have
not square danced since the time our school made us do it in the
fourth or fifth grade.  Rob Nugen&rsquo;s girlfriend Wende, a young woman
whom I thought I would never see again after she was a visitor at
Houston but whom I was pleasantly surprised to see at OKC and find
out she was an advisor so I would get to see her many more times,
asked me to dance with her, and I did even though I didn&rsquo;t have any
desire to except for maybe a small inkling, but I did because she
asked me to and if I asked somebody to dance it would really spoil my
fun if they said no, and I wanted to do something nice for Wende,
because I wasn&rsquo;t against dancing either, I just needed  a little
motivation, and damnit, I had a lot of fun square dancing, and I
don&rsquo;t care if you or anybody else likes it or not, something I didn&rsquo;t
have to worry about among my YRUU friends, and I think that was why I
really enjoyed it, that I would enjoy almost anything I do with them.
(Man, that was a long sentence)  The contra dancers had a band and a
bunch of dancers to guide, and one of the woman dancers, who reminded
me of a transvestite, Danielle, in my fellowship, had this loose
dress that would fly up way too far whenever she would twirl and you
could see her butt and everything.
<p>
They stayed until after eleven, but I only danced for a comparatively
short period of time and after I quit I sat on the floor with Anna
and Jim and Wendy and watched.  While Anna was listening to a discman
and couldn&rsquo;t hear us, the cover of the Romeo and Juliet soundtrack
made Jim think of the time when Anna had been going on about how
great Leonardo Dicaprio was and her grandfather had asked why, he was
such a dork, and Anna had gone off on him, so Jim told me about it.<br />
Then the same picture reminded me of my Incredible Hulk
impersonation, so I showed it to them.
<p>
I saw Bill Loden and Bethany Manning, a rally virgin from Fayetville,
together, and they seemed like they had known each other for a long
time.  This didn&rsquo;t seem very likely at all, so I asked Bill, and he
said no, he had just &ldquo;gotten a feeling&rdquo; that he should know her,
which would sound weird coming from anyone else but Bill, because
Bill is a very wise and spiritually developed person, like his mom.<br />
By the way, this rally was the one-year anniversary of the day Bill
quit smoking.
<p>
After the contra dancers left, Rob started a physical game, crab tag,
and it mutated into several variations of tag, until I suggested
we play Link, a tag game involving pairs of people linking and
unlinking.  At a point when James and I were linked, we took a break
to get some of Bill and Cathy Saur&rsquo;s birthday cake.  Their birthdays
were both on the same day, I think Saturday.  I accidentally dropped
my cake and got icing on Joanna&rsquo;s sleeping bag, but it was alright
because I licked most of it off.  About this time, (Kitty) Kat came
back, because she had left for work at five, and she had lost her
voice.
<p>
The talent show was the next event, and it was good even though it
was in the sanctuary, which was cold.  It got to me after a while, so
Anna and I got under my jacket to warm up.  Although it was an
exceptionally great talent show with a lot of original acts, like
poems and songs by Rob and Samantha doing a perfect moonwalk in a
dance, sleep was constantly nagging at me until I was brought back
instantly from the edge of consciousness by Steve asking if anyone
knew the words to &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo;, a fairly exclusive bit of knowledge
which I possess and am proud of.  I always jump at the chance to sing
&ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo;, especially since there is little competition because
the song seems all but forgotten, a situation which I will take time
to remedy.  So Brian and I sang &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo; with Steve playing and
singing backup.  Steve also played his classic, &ldquo;Rocky Racoon&rdquo;, and a
few others before &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo; which I was not awake for.
<p>
I went to worship at eleven, right after the talent show, which was
put on by Austin, who is a good worship coordinator.  It was a
foot-washing, thought-sharing worship.  Nick Carter and I washed each
other&rsquo;s feet.  When we had all shared our thoughts and meditations on
washing feet, we sang a pagan chant:  &ldquo;We are a circle, within a
circle, with no beginning, and never ending&rdquo; and had a big long group
hug.  We were so emotional, you would have thought we were about to
say goodbye if you didn&rsquo;t know any better.  It just goes to show the
power of a good foot washing.
<p>
&ldquo;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&rdquo; was supposed to play downstairs at
midnight, but it turned out to be two.  Melissa and Suzanne and
Tiffany dressed up for it in various outfits which showed their legs,
and I guess they were embarassed about their legs, especially
Tiffany, because I saw them in the hall a few times, and every time
they would duck behind a corner, and when I went to ask them what
they were doing, they would run giggling and screaming into the
girl&rsquo;s bathroom.  I was going to watch the movie, but I knew I
wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stay awake for it, and since there were no
comfortable places to go to sleep downstairs, I skipped it and
wandered around, occasionally running into a small group of people
who were still awake.
<p>
I floated around on bits and peices of drowsy conversation with the
stragglers, and put all the left over brownie crumbs in a bowl and
poured milk over them to eat them.  They didn&rsquo;t make me as sick as I
thought they would.  Finally, about an hour and a half before wake
up, which was at the usual time of six a.m., I decided to go to the
high school room and find a mattress to lay down on and go to sleep.<br />
And then, twenty minutes later, I got around to staggering out there
through the cold for an hour&rsquo;s sleep before cleaning up.
<p>
But my hour of sleep was not to be.  No, it mutated into two hours
and forty-seven minutes of sleep.  I woke up and looked around to
find everyone else still asleep.  It didn&rsquo;t think I had woken up
early, so I looked at my watch and it said 7:47.  We were almost two
hours late!  I quickly went back into the main building to find out
from somebody what was going, a failed effort because there was
nobody awake to find out from, ok though because it was pretty
self-explanatory at this point.  Nobody had woken up!  No problem, it
was but a matter of minutes until Debbie was running around with a
whistle and screaming and kicking people.  I went back out to the
high school room to wake people up and tell them we were late, then
went back inside to wake people and clean up in there.  A while
later, before Debbie had gotten there, I went to the high school room
again and found that hardly anybody had gotten up.  So I warned them,
&ldquo;Get up quick or Debbie will come out here blowing a whistle and
screaming and kicking people!&ldquo;, but no sooner had I uttered the words
than I heard a now-familiar shrill sound and imperative yet cheery
voice, and a few seconds later my prophecy came true when Debbie
burst through the door.  I evacuated immediately and went to the main
building again to clean up.  I donated the fondly remembered bubbles
from SWUUSI to the church, because someone had lost the lid, and
the huge jug was just about empty anyway.  Since we were late,
everyone busted their asses and we got finished with time to spare.<br />
<p>
At closing circle we did &ldquo;Dead Puppies&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bish-Bish&rdquo; and got
mugbooks, which were not nearly as good as Little Rock&rsquo;s I thought,
but were not the worst I&rsquo;ve seen.  Bryan gave out his new copies of
the &ldquo;Yackity-Yac&rdquo;, with the rally review of Little Rock and dates of
rallies and SWUUSI until San Antonio next year.  Breakfast was
assorted doughnuts, which are always better than plain glazed
doughnuts, and there were plenty left over when most of the people
left.  I think we were the last to leave.  I thought I would never
get done saying goodbye.  I enjoy every rally more than the last one,
which never seems possible at the time, but I can tell I am still
growing and changing, and I can&rsquo;t wait for Ft. Worth in May.

<h1>SECOND ANNUAL HOUSTON RALLY 17-19 JANUARY 1997</h1></p>

<p><p>
Way back in like May 1996, I was called by Jason Fricke, and/or Nick Devereux
to see if I would act as adult host for the Houston Rally in January.  I was
extremely flattered and accepted immediately.</p>

<p><p>
Jason Fricke was the youth dean of the rally.  We called him The Dean on th&rsquo;
Scene.  I was the Host with the Most.
<p></p>

<p>We planned essentially nothing until we pulled together at the last moment the
Construct-O-Con (small planning rally) sometime back in October.  At that rally
we played all weekend except for a planning meeting that lasted about 2 hours
on Saturday afternoon.  I bring this up only to describe how we decided upon a
theme.</p>

<p><p>
It went something like this</p>

<p><p>
Jason: Let&rsquo;s call it Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip Rally!<br>
Rob:   How about YRUU Con?<br>
Jason: How about Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip?<br>
Rob:   How about YRUU Yukon Con?<br>
Jason: What about Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip!?<br>
Rob:   How about you come to the Yukon?<br>
Jason: Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip!!!<br>
Rob:   What the hell is Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip????<br>
Jason: I don&rsquo;t know.  It&rsquo;s just cool.<br>
Rob:   Well, how about something about the Yukon, because it sounds like YRUU
Con, and it&rsquo;s gonna be cold like the Yukon??<br>
Jason: Biff&rsquo;s Wonderful Clam Dip!!!<br></p>

<p><p>
The conversation deteriorated from there.</p>

<p><p>
We decided upon the title <em>YRUu Conning Me?</em>, and the T-Shirt design depicted
a seedy looking eskimo thrusting toward the viewer a small can of Biff&rsquo;s
Wonderful Clam Dip for $50.</p>

<p><p>
That, officially, is my version of how we chose such a random theme.
<p>
After the first meeting, most of the planning was done over the phone.<br />
Tuesday before the rally, I was talking to Jason, and we wanted to figure out a
cool cool cool Saturday Night Activity for the rally.  We had considered an author,
whose name I have forgotten  Peter McWilliams? who has written on lots of
controversial subjects to do something.  We considered getting a band,
or a street performer type person.
<p>
Then Jason said, &ldquo;ROB!!! I&rsquo;ve got it!!  We can do a Casino Night!!!&rdquo;<br>
My brain said, &ldquo;you kiddin&rsquo; me?  We&rsquo;ve got 3 days &lsquo;til the rally&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
then my other brain said, &ldquo;shut up, brain, we can do this.&rdquo;<br>
So I said, &ldquo;dude, Jason, that would <em>rule</em>!  How can we pull this off?&rdquo;
<p>
We brainstormed:
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll need some fake cash, and some prizes, and some cards, and I don&rsquo;t
know what all else. &ldquo;
We jotted some ideas down and decided I would get the cash, and Jason would
get the prizes.  Jason somehow got a green felt Blackjack table cover and he
bought some cheap but functional bingo cards.  I bought a similar roulette wheel
and we were in business.
<p>
We mostly had everything ready to go by the Friday of the rally.
Jason and I met at SAM&rsquo;S CLUB Friday afternoon to purchase food.<br />
Wow.  Jason had his hair put up in two rows of spikes, so we got a
lot of attention, especially from some older ladies near the baked goods section.
I was wearing the rally shirt, with the seedy eskimo on the back.  I wondered what the yuppy-lookin&rsquo;
people in the store thought.<br />
<p>
We filled up one of their big carts, and then grabbed a flatbed cart thing and filled that up.
We topped off the flatbed with 40 loaves of bread.
Just over $500 in food.  Crazy.
<p>
That evening, about 94 youth, 11 advisors all descended upon First UU church in Houston, and I was in
charge of it all.  Wow.  It felt weird at first: running the advisor meetings, and answering
questions from every direction.  Taking charge is not something I&rsquo;m used to doing.
<p>
Unfortunately, the first problem happened really early in the evening, and just totally blew
me away.  Money had been stolen from like 3 different youths&rsquo; bags or purses or whatever.
It pissed me off; I felt helpless.  To have that happen at a rally is so entirely foreign;
I did not expect to have that problem whatsoever.
<p>
Opening circle was cool, though a bit long with all the YAC announcement stuff and what I
had to announce about my displeasure that some stuff had been stolen.
<p>
The first night went well, otherwise.  Rovers roved and I gave answers.  Strange to have
everyone looking to me for answers.  My decision.  Up to me.  It came easily in some cases.
Sometimes I delegated or asked for input, but a lot of times I just told them..  Just quick
problem solving.<br />
<p>
It kinda feels like advisor initiation to host a rally.<br />
<p>
I stayed awake till like 5:30 the first night.  I was roving around and was surprised to find
a touch group that just stuck together.  They started talking at about 2am after opening circle
and just kept on talking..  I joined their discussion about school, growing up, something else,
and something else until I was just too crazy tired.
Slept from about 5:30 to 7am.
<p>
The first workshop on Saturday was Government -vs- Personal Morality.  It gave a lot of stunning
questions to ponder- Do we pay for health care for the poor?  How much should they get?  Do we just
keep them alive, or out of pain?  Do we <br>enforce</br> health care for poor with infectious diseases?<br />
What about tuberculosis, with requires 6 weeks to cure, and if the treatment stops
before it&rsquo;s complete, the result is a stronger strain of the TB virus???????
<p>
Before that workshop completed its discussion session, the drumming workshop began downstairs.
I went down there after the morality workshop, grabbed a drum and joined in.<br />
<p>
The next workshop was mandatory: a presentation then question and answer session by 3 members of
H.A.T.C.H. (Houston Area Teen Coalition for Homosexuals)  We heard coming-out stories by each of
the 3 guys, and then were able to ask them questions.  It was emotional, informative, and great.
<p>
After that, we started to set up stuff for Casino Night, the Saturday night event.  During this
time, things got a bit crazy upstairs and Jason Fricke came running down.
<p>
&ldquo; ROB!!  Somebody just put a hole through the wall <em>This</em> <em>Big</em>!!&rdquo; he exclaimed, indicating
about 3 by 5 feet.<br>
I just started laffin.   This was too fuckin&rsquo; nuts to be true.<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;M NOT KIDDING ROB!!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I Know!&rdquo;   (AUGGHH!!)   &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go check it out.&rdquo;<br>
<p>
So, with much support from Linda Loden, youth on YAC, and a couple of advisors, I had to get the
rally under control, but I still wanted Casino night to go well.   (I wanted to just shout,
&ldquo;Everybody sit down and be quiet or go home!!!!!&rdquo;     )   After thinking through many different
scenarios, I decided to get all the youth up on 3rd floor and make them chill.
A few youth were chillin&rsquo; in the downstairs courtyard the entire time and I let them stay.
<p>
We herded everyone upstairs and had the advisors keep an eye on everyone while the YAC and I
interrogated those directly involved.<br />
The end decision was that the youth who actually hit the wall and the youth
directing the activity would pay for it monetarily, and apologize personally to Heather Lynn
Hanson (interim minister(?)) and the reverend Bob Schaibly.
<p>
Then we got <em>all</em> the youth into one room and talked to them.   I am highly indebted to
Laura Moriaty for firmly reminding everyone how we all signed a sheet saying we&rsquo;ll abide by
the Big 4 rules, including Respect of everything including the church.     She reminded
everyone how we are a community and how everyone looks bad when this happens.  &ldquo;How
can the YAC get anyone to believe we&rsquo;re responsible if this kind of stuff happens?&rdquo;
<p>
Once the verdict was announced, Mike Noyes was all,
&ldquo;why make them pay for it?  If we&rsquo;re a community, everyone should chip in.&rdquo;<br />
(What a difference that made in the rally.)
<p>
At the end of the discussion, I said something like I was upset, but dammit, we worked
hard to do Casino Night, and I want it to be fun!
<p>
Within about 15 minutes after everyone was released, about 140 bucks was collected
from the youth to help pay for the wall.  I described it later as &ldquo;everyone anted up.
&lsquo;I am in this community.&rsquo;&rdquo;  It really helped bring the group together.
<p>
Casino Night was great fun.  As people walked in the door, I handed out stacks of
$271 (?) worth of fake bills, with
the faces of the youth and myself who helped design the rally.  I was on the $1,
Nick Devereux on the $5,  Nick Carter on the 10, Patrick Zinn on the $20  Jason Fricke on the $50 and
Jennifer Warren, Amanda Hovland, and  Charlotte Benbenek-Price together on the $100.  Way cool.
<p>
Bingo, Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, and everyone who wanted gambled and had a great time.
Afterward, we auctioned off fabulous prizes.  toothbrushes went for between $400 and $600.
pez dispensers for $1000s.  Deodorant for $800.  A can of Spam for multiple 1000s.  A &ldquo;bag o&rsquo; candy&rdquo;
went for 1000s, which was pretty funny because it was old-ass chocolate so hard you couldn&rsquo;t
bite through it.  (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry sir- no returns&rdquo;)
<p>
For every item, Luke _________ kept yelling, &ldquo;Fifty Dollars!&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s all he had, even if
the price was in the 1000s.  He began to get creative with his bargaining, and it went something
like this:<br>
&ldquo;A night with Luke!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not worth 800 dollars!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<b>Two</b> nights with Luke!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;<b>That&rsquo;s</b> not worth 800 dollars!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you head!&rdquo;<br>
Funny wacky stuff.
<p>
The biggest prize was the gumball machine, so we sold it last.
Jason held it up over his head.<br>
&ldquo;1 dollar!&rdquo; yelled Ben Atkinson.<br>
&ldquo;50 dollars!&rdquo; yelled Luke.<br>
&ldquo;300 dollars!&rdquo; yelled someone else.<br>
&ldquo;Five Thousand Dollars!!!&rdquo; yelled someone over the din.
<p>
The crowd cheered and the someone added their 300 dollars to the 5000 dollars and
the 50 dollars was chipped in to make the gumball machine sale go for $5350.  Great fun.
The funny funny funny funniest part was that the gumball machine required a penny to
let you have a piece of gum!!!
<p>
Then the No Talent Talent Show and Mike Noyes did a rap to drumming and Debe Barnes
and Bobby Hall pantomimed &ldquo;Bish Bish&rdquo; and we had no idea what in the world it was
until the walked back to their seats laffin&rsquo; &ldquo;That was Bish Bish!!!&rdquo;
At the end Nick Devereux did a 15 minute version of the Fuck You Clown joke.
<p>
Midnight worship happened at 2am and we basically just sat in a circle and
verbally tossed in good thoughts about the rally or whatever.<br />
<p>
After that, I played silent football with some of the best silent
football players from 2am till 5:30 am Saturday night after having been awake
since Friday morning (except for 1.5 hour nap)
This was the first game where Carina Dormio and I got to play together after
nearly a year of challenging each other.  - this dates back all the way to Dallas Rally
1996 where she made me get a penance point by jabbing me in the side during the game
and I told her she would <em>never</em> be able to get me another penance point again.
Nick Carter was Mr Dictator and I got <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> penance point for sticking my tongue out at
Carina (after she got <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> penance point for sticking her tongue out at me)
During the game, the funniest thing was when the elevator would <em>ding</em> and the door would open and
suddenly <em>blaring</em> random acoustic guitar and a wailing voice singing some random song would
jolt the quiet of the game.  It was amazingly funny, and difficult not to laugh and look to see
who the heck it was!!!
Also during the game, Kris Shallin sat in the circle, thereby tricking Carina, who counted him as
a player and went out of turn.  That was funny.  Someone accused Mr Dictator for seeing
Kris in the circle, and Nick retorted, &ldquo;I did not say I saw any non existing entity between Mr Rob
and Mr Jeff; I said that if Ms Carina had seen a non existing entity between Mr Rob and Mr Jeff
then Ms Carina would obviously have been mistaken.&rdquo;  Good job.<br>
Mr Dictator lost the game.  I had <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> penance point; Carina had 1.5.  Ha.
<p>
I slept for 1 hour after that until wakeup time at 6:30am.  I woke up the advisors and then
went out to find Jon Whitten-Lege rousing the youth by drumming like mad  on the various floors.
The coolest thing was when he would get a beat going [Boom] [Boom] [Boom] [Boom] [Boom] [Boom]
and then pause for a second and then doubletime [Boom|Boom|Boom|Boom|Boom|Boom|Boom|Boom|Boom]
<p>
I learned a lesson.  When I&rsquo;m the host of a rally, I need to get more than 2.5 hours of sleep.
I really appreciate Debe Barnes and Linda Loden helping me coordinate the waking of youth and
cleanup and getting them out.  We were highly late getting out and had a quick closing circle
&ldquo;Good Friends&rdquo; &ldquo;Yogi Bear&rdquo; &ldquo;Beaver Song&rdquo; and then had &lsquo;em grab a donut and head out the door.
<p>
Wende Whitlock saved my butt by being awake enough to do all the bookkeeping and stuff
after the rally.  I really appreciate her help.
<p>
That was it.  A great rally and maybe we can do it again (without the hole in the wall) next year.
<p>
With Love<br>
- Rob</p>
