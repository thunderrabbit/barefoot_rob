<p>(not proofread)</p>

<p class=date>Sunday 11 February 1990</p>

<p>I just got back today from the 1990 Dallas Rally.  On Friday I
picked up Fred (my brother) from his house & we met Rick E and Mike O
at 6pm.  We left in Rick's truck shortly afterward.  We got there at
about 10:something & not many people were there.  I got a mesage to
call my mom (She's going to school at SMU, which is very close to the
church).  I called her and she invited me to come see her apartment.
It was neat.  Very small, but neat.  She has a little kitchen sink &
table & couch & her computer where the T.V. would be.  I met her
friend Lilliann ("Lilly Anne - all one word")  She's really nice.  I
played a little bit of Vegas Gambler while they sat on the couch and
watched... That was fun, but the Rally was calling.  So mom took me
back while Lilliann slept on Ma's couch.</p>

<p>
I got back and saw Joy B and Aaron M again (They got there just before I went to Ma's).  Delayna D was there & Mikael the girl was there.  Opening circle was at 2AM.  We all stood up and said something about ourselves.  Jody K was the first to go.  She was sitting beside me.  Just like my very first Rally, I stood up right after she was done.  I said, "I'm not going last."  Then Dallas D, Alva's sister realized she would be last...
<p>
After the circle, I walked around and talked to different people.  Troy S showed me some pictures.. Including the "Brawn Hand Blender" which he gave me today while we at donuts at the end of the Rally.
<p>
Fred sat by Jasmine -- He held her hand the entire weekend.  Joy sat on my shoulders for a while like last year.  I took Mikael's neat bracelet & wore it for a while.  Delayna and I sat and talked about old times.. Including about Dustin & all those from ConCon 1988.  Delayna & I slept beside each other at about 3:30AM.  We slept till about 7AM.
<p>
We all had pancakes for breakfast.  While standing in line for the pancakes I met Chris - a little guy who I believe is blind or mostly blind.  I helped him get his pancakes & sausage -- & I got him some OJ.  After breakfast I sat with him for a while --I didn't know if he would be ok alone or what.  I finally decided he would be.  I asked if he would-He was..
<p>
For the first workshop I went to Youth Power.  The guy told us how we could do things that would benefit society.  Things that didn't take lots of brains, but very helpful... Like build parks or clean up trash or volunteer in a hospital or whatever.  It was a neat workshop. 
<p>
We had sandwiches for lunch that day - bologna & cheese & ham & mayo.  No lettuce or tomato though... oh well.  Oh - I put chips on mine.  I had 3 sandwiches.  I needed the energy for Ultimate frisbee which we played just after lunch.
<p>
Oh- just before lunch I went to the YMCA with Aaron M to take showers.  I didn't bring my towel so I used his.  I watched some guys play racquetball for a while afterward.  They were good...
<p>
After lunch we went to the YMCA field to play frisbee.  There were some guys already there playing football.  Since we both wanted the whole field, one of the football guys & me & Aaron & someone else who I don't remember his name (he did the meditation workshop..) went into the office to see who would have to go.  The girl there didn't know & she called "Ed" who apparently ran the Y.  He said the church had the field.  Yay!  Me and Aaron thought we were just the baddest dudes in the world after that.  As we walked out he casually put his hand behind him & we gave eachother five.
<p>
Ultimate frisbee was great.  It had rained, so the field was just the right amount of soft.  I made a couple of spectacular catches- one where I jumped way up over a guy & snagged it before he caught it.  It was a totally great game.  I ran & ran & ran.
<p>
After that was the second set of workshops.  I went to the meditation.  I really really relaxed during that.  It was great.  I fell asleep for only a little bit of it.
<p>
After that I went out to the swings with Aaron & Delayna & Joy & Jennifer B (I think that's her name) That was neat.  I got up on the swing set & walked across the bar.  I didn't even fall.. I climbed 3 of the trees out there.  They were pretty good climbing trees.  One had very pokin' bark & it hurt my feet though.
<p>
At one point we went out to the wall & waved at all the cars.  The highlights were the Porsches & BMWs & Mercedes.. The highlight of the highlights was "<em>Lamborghini!!</em>"<br>
We all jumped off the wall - yelling & waving as we ran toward the sidewalk.  The guy saw us & revved up his engine.  The sound was beautiful.  So powerful & cool.  Vroo- Vroo- VROOOOOOOOM!!!  It was completely kick ass awesome.  It was a beautiful red Lamborghini - forgive me for not knowing what model...
<p>
Oh- we quit waving to cars after one driver <b>bumped</b> a van because he was watching us & not the road... 
<p>After workshops & cars & stuff I was part of a circle in the hallway - we did some ohms & then I suggested that we play the squeeze game - I got in the middle & tried to locate a hand squeeze that went around the circle.  I never could find it... So we played the telephone game.  I started the first one: "Three men & a monkey went hunting in the forest with a rainbow."<br>
When it got around, it was something about some people in a parking lot.
<p>
The next one was started - something about pink converse tennis shoes.  Maybe it was, "I bought some ham in my pink converse."  It got around to me: "I will not eat green eggs & sperm I am Sam, Sam I am."  Wow.
<p>
After that Mike A's band was playing.  We went to see them.  It was pretty cool.  They played a big variety of stuff.  Including, "I'm an airplane" & one with a neat neat drum beat.
<p>
After the concert we had the talent show.  It was great.  I did the Fairy Tale with Mike A and I drew a picture of Mike O.  I also sold some Coke (Coca Cola) to Fred.  It was funny.  Carrie did a great mime, "locked in a box".  After the concert I sat with Jennifer and Aaron and Joy and Mikael and we talked and took turns listening to a super cool CD of Aaron's.  It was a German group - I forget their name.  The song was a series of synthesized drum beats in stereo-  cool cool stuff.
<p>
That night I slept alone from 4 to 7AM.  I got up after dying for a few minutes from being so so so so sore. I cleaned up my stuff & then went to closing circle.
<p>
We sang Dear Friends & Yogi Bear & Plastic Jesus & Halls of LRY.  We then did a couple of Colorado hugs on my suggestion, & then we did a spiral - Shane's suggestion.  With 90 people - that got complicated.  But we did it and it was fun.
<p>
We then had donuts outside & exchanged last hugs and goodbyes. I really didn't want to go.  Troy gave me the Brawn Hand Blender picture -  I gave him my address.. I wonder what will happen... Joy told me not to write her - she would write me.  I promised a letter to Jennifer and Delayna.  I hugged everyone again and again.  
<p>
I saw Aaron.  We hugged & I was saying, "shit man..."  No words... I didn't want to go.  I'm going to miss everyone... We left, though.  Rick drove the entire way.  
<p>
We only stopped once - for gas.  Fred and Mike slept all the way; I slept about 1/2 the way.  We got to the church and I put on a name tag: "Hello I'm <b>TIRED</b>."  It was great.</p>

<p class=date>23 August 1988</p>

<p>
I got back from ConCon 2 days ago.  It was so incredible.  There is simply no way of fully describing ConCon - so I won't do it.  But I will of course tell about some of the stuff I did.
<p>
On August 15 my flight was at 12:20PM and I got there with 45 minutes to spare.  I changed planes in Dallas Love Field after a 50 minute flight.  My next flight was from 1:45 to 2:35.  I met up with a bunch of SW District peoples at Dallas.  Joe K, Gayle K, Rockin' Robin D, Deborah D, Paul K, and a couple other people.  We got to Tulsa and ConCon people identified us easily.  Tie dye shirts, Mr. Happy Condom ("Dress well for every occasion") shirts, juggling balls, riped up pants... So they took us to the baggage claim.  I had no baggage so I continued to where our shuttles (cars of nice UU adults) were to pick us up.
<p>
I got on the next shuttle with 3 other youth.  We were driven to the YMCA where we waited until the bus to take us to the camp.  At the Y, I saw Kelly H again. Actually she saw me first and waded through people to give me a huge hug. She sat on my lap and we talked about old times.
<p>
Eventually there were calls of, "the bus is here!!" echoing through the building.  We piled out of the room to get to the elevator. By the time I got my bags it was almost full but I said, "well, just take my bags" and I slowly put them in the elevator.  Just as the door was closing, I jumped in myself.  There was a big guy in there who was quite impressed. I would later know him as "Donny" (spelled Donne I think) from Michigan.
<p>
We got on the bus which was <b>very hot</b>, like no air condition, and drove for about 1 hour to the camp.  We were the first bus there and we got off in a happy daze. We were directed to the Beacon House to register & choose our workshop. Then we went to the Jet to get our Secret Buddies & make buttons and our mailbag.  My button looked like this:
<pre>

         CON^2 88
         MR. COOL
          yellow
            Rob
              N
</pre>
<p>
except it was yellow and the words were handwritten.
<p>
The workshop that I signed up for was the ropes course.  It was really super incredible. I'll tell about that first.
<p>
Ok- the first day we did different trust things - Trust Falls, Wind in the Willow.  That was neat.  Then we had to group together to solve a problem.  The problem was set in California during an earthquake.  We all had to get on a big wooden spool (halfway stable ground) and get to another spool (completely stable ground) by using a tire, 1/2 a cinder block, and two 10 foot boards.  The spools were 15 feet apart.  We did not have to use all the equipment.  We figured out how to do it in about 10 minutes and we did it.
<p>
The next thing involved a huge spider web (ropes).  It was set in The Dark Forest (or something like that) of JRR Tolkein's <em>The Hobbit</em>.  We had to get everybody through the web without anyone touching the web and without using and of the holes twice.  This was quite a challenge, but we did it in about 30 minutes. Oh- there were 15 people in our ropes course group.
<p>
The next problem involved a giant toothpick (10 foot tall, 10 inch wide steel pipe) sticking straight up out of the ground with 3 lifesavers (car tires) on it. Our job was to get the lifesavers off the toothpick and put them back on in a different order.  rules:  No one can touch the toothpick and only 3 people can touch on tire, 3 different people can touch another tire, and 3 different people can touch the last tire.  We did it.  Chuck and I were bases to get people up high enough to get the tires off and on.
<p>
The last low ground thing we did was the trust walk.  This consisted of 2 X 6 boards bolted to posts in the ground.  We were blindfolded and walked on the 2 inch edge of the 2 X 6s with people holding our hands and telling us where to put our feet.  That was interesting.  Especially since we had people going the opposite direction at the same time.
<p>
This is kinda what the course looked like from above:
<pre>


        |----|
        |    |1
        |    |___
        |       / 
        |      /_____
        |        ____
        |    ___/ 
        |___/ 
          2 

</pre>
Sections 1 and 2 were really steep.
<p>
Also, there were different levels where the boards met - like you would have to step up or down to get to the next board.  After we did all of the low stuff, we were ready for the high ropes course!
<p>
I was the third person to go through it, not including the instructor, Mike, who showed us how.  The course started about 30 feet high in a tree.  We had to use a ladder to get up.  First you walk up a really steep log about 15 feet long.  It was at about a 40 degree angle.  Then we walked along a 3 wire bridge about 60 feet long. Then along a 50 foot long 2 wire bridge.  The next thing was called the cat walk.  It consisted of 2 wires side by side about 1 1/2 feet apart.  It was 12 feet long and 30 feet in the air. (The 3 line bridge started at 35 feet and went down to 30 feet.  The two line stayed at 30)  To cross the cat walk, we had to get down on our hands and knees and crawl across.  In the middle, we had to meow - (it was the cat walk).  Nagel got confused and barked, but that's okay.  Once we crossed that, we had to walk along a level log about 25 feet long - using no hands - just walk across. I did that easily.  Tina, the girl who belayed me was mildly impressed and commented like, "oooooh - look at him go."  I was pleased.  The next thing was a set of three logs all bolted together.  We had to walk or run or trot down them- any which way.  the last two were unsupported in the middle and kind of bounced as you walked across them.  I didn't quite trot, but I definitely went faster than walking across them.  The next thing was a pulley that you rolled down the wire with.  That was neat.  It was about 50 feet long, and we got to go zipping down that.  The last thing was "<em>The Screamer</em>."  A big swing that started about 40 feet in the air.  The wire that it was attached to was about 60 feet high.  We were all tied in and leaned forward... - a bit more, more... and  WHoooooosh!!! we went flying down and up to where we could hit a tree with our foot and then back to give Mike a "high five." Then we just swung until we were almost stopped.  Then some guys slowed us down and unhooked us.  That was so neat.  
<p>
The last part of the ropes course was at the two towers. Each tower consisted of 3 telephone poles like this:  (top view)
<p>
<pre>


        *                0                *
     *  |---------------------------------|  *
        *                                 *

</pre>
<p>
The pole (0) was about 30 feet tall and about 8 feet from the wire (----).
<p>

The two towers were about 60 feet apart.  We climbed on of the towers and rappeled back down.  Normally we would used the zip cord but it was past its warranty date.  That would have been excellent - but oh well.  I climbed and rappelled 3 times.  The last time I got all the way down in one push away from the wall.
The towers were about 35 feet high.
<p>
After I climbed the tower once, I did the last and most amazing thing there.  I had psyched myself up for about 5 minutes before I did it.  I was completely strapped in and then I was ready.
<p>
I climbed the 30 foot pole and stood on the top of it, about 9 inches in diameter.  Hanging from the wire about 8 feet in front of me was a trapeze. It hung about 1 foot below the wire.  I simply had to jump out and catch it.  I focused on the wire and everything else disappeared.  I was mentally standing on ground & I could just as easily walk out to the wire as I could pick my nose.  I just decided to jump out and catch it.  I said, "it's like gymnastics" and jumped.  I felt the trapeze hit my hands and clamped on. I made it. People below were clapping and cheering. I was happy. I did a penny drop off of the trapeze and was lowered to the ground.
<p>
To shorten the story, I'll just say only 2 other people caught the trapeze out of 12 who tried.  The three of us who did it wanted to do it again.  So we came back later in the afternoon.  Graham jumped first but didn't make it. Then Nagel went and didn't make it. I went and made it.  I was definitely Mr Cool.
<p>

<p>
Ok- um - the first night I went to supper and then to my cabin - Cabin 9

     Ultimate
     frisbee in

</pre>
<p>
We listened to Beastie Boys and Donne and I acted dump and danced to it.  We went outside and saw shooting stars which was kind of neat.
<p>
A typical day:<br>
Wake up, take a shower, eat, go to workshop (ropes course), go to spirit circle, lunch, free time, touch groups, supper, worship, sleep.
<p>
(3 November 1988)<br>
(It's been over 2 months so my memory is going...)<br>
I spent 3 nights up on Chapel on the Hill.  The view from there was fantastic. You could see out over a valley & part of the lake.
<p>
Chapel on the Hill was interesting in itself. It was just a metal grate floor, a podium, benches and a roof.  The floor was made of like the grate things you see in front of doors to get mud off.
Like this:

<p> the *s are metal and the rest was open air.
So it kind of hurt to walk barefoot on and was funky to sleep on, but the view in the morning was worth it.
<p>
There was a lot of cool people at ConCon<br>
<ul>
<li>Michelle B with a soft voice and nice brown eyes and sweet personality</li>
<li>Chuck G - who was in the ropes course with me and reminded me all the heck of my cousin Peter. He was a big guy.</li>
<li>Jessica B who can dance and smile and climb trees and play frisbee...</li>
<li>Delayna D with her cute as anything nose that would make her giggle when we pressed it.</li>
<li>Adam L, the most peaceful guy.. he made an announcement at spirt circle, "If something pleases you, instead of clapping, rub your hands together like this." (fingers pointing foward rub back and forth not up and down)</li>
<li>Brian M - who was always late to touchgroup was darn peaceful too.  He did a meditation too.</li>
<li>Lisa N, who ate honey while Dustin, Jack and I did our rap at 4AM on the last night.</li>
<li>Parisa P, who was my touch group leader.  She was quiet and dignified and peaceful</li>
<li>Tex - he was a short guy who was quite a riot. He rode the plane home with me. We met lots of people, and tried unsuccessfully to steal the display oxygen mask. We got caught by some lady passenger who told on us.</li>

<p>I don't know why I woke up early.  I got a letter from Shay
Pickerell yesterday.  It was short but nice.  She hasn't been to
church since I met her at the OKC Rally.  Kelly has not written to me
yet.  I will write to her and give her the details on the Houston
Rally.  Church today will be fun. We are having a pic-nic.  I hope we
can grab that room.  I will bring my Spuds Mackenzie poster for it.
We will need to put a bulliten board in there and a whole bunch of
pillows.  A stero is needed, too.  Well, that's about all.  Good
Morning 6:50AM</p>

<p>We had no meeting yesterday.  It will be Tuesday.  I need to
practice rifles more than I have been.  I need to bring a poster on
something for the NUTS Room.  Spuds Mackenzie probably.  I want a
whole lot of pillows for that room.  It will be great. Bryn wrote me a
letter, but it was very short and she didn't put our usual pictures at
the end.  I'm finding it hard to write back properly.  OH Well.  Good
night.  I want Lucid Dreams 10:35</p>

<p class=date>10:40 Wednesday the 29 of April, 1987.</p>

<p>The Rally was awesome.  Cheri had fun.  I am glad.  Debbie Wagner
went with me and mom there.  When we got to the hotel, no youth were
around.  They had gone to the youth hopitality houses.  Debbie found
Rusty Cockrell's room.  (he is sort of out of the teen group) We
talked some and then Cheri & Emily came.  We talked and then me,
Debbie, Em and Cheri went to the girls' hospitality house.  There was
no youth there, either.  Finally someone came.  David Garvoille,
Deborah Dixon, Gail Kean.  Then the rest came who had already gotten
there and gone on a walk.  Ginnie Kilgore, Alisa Velonis, Mike Alves,
Shawn McDaniel, and some new people.  Bryn, Katie, Janine, and some
guys.  We talked till about 12:00.  Then the guys went to our house.
We were up until about 2.  I slept on the floor.  Woke up at about
7:30.  Took a shower, ate, and we left for the hotel.  Ginnie did a
workshop: 1/2 of the group asks questions, and other 1/2 answers.
Then we went out by the pool.  Only me, Alva, and Ginnie swam.  I
found out that lemon peel tastes rather sweet after eating a lemon.
[From my memory as I transcribe my own entry: this is the time that
Ginnie was rubbing lemon juice on her leg hairs to bleach them.  "Turn
blonde, you fuckers!"  So funny!] Then we had lunch.  Then we all went
for a walk.  All 20 or so of us jaywalked a busy street.  That was
funny.  We just took our time.  Sorta bee-boppin' across- just
jammin'.  We went to a miniature shopping mall.  We went into Photon.
That has to be the biggest rippoff.  There was no way we were going to
play.  There was a meeting going on when we came back.  I sat by
Emily, Cheri, Ginnie, & Christina.  The meeting was very boring.
David Garvoille had some fizzy pop things.  When you put them in your
mouth, they pop like rice krispies.  Ginnie put a ton of them in her
mouth and I could easily hear her.  Then the speaker up front said
something incredibly dumb.  Everyone started cracking up and I thought
that would be a good time to tell Ginnie that she sounded like a bowl
of rice krispies.  I turned around and they both (Christina and
Ginnie) started totally cracking up.  Later they said I had the
funniest look that said "why did she say that?"  Whatever.  The three
of us left after that.  We had to go to the YAC meeting.  Before that
Ginnie went to change her clothes.  I went with her.  She didn't have
a key to the room they were in.  So she called a janitor who happened
to be on the floor.  He opened the door for us with no question.  We
could have done it for <em>any</em> room at all.  Talk about loose
security!  Then we went to the YAC meeting.  We voted on how YRUU
would spend money this year.  We also decided the fate of people who
do drugs or alcohol at rallies.  On the first offense, they are sent
home, and suspended from rallies for a year.  On the second time, they
are sent home and will never come to another rally.  Ginnie was
telling us about some cases of drugs from Dallas and drinking at
SWUUSI. The whole time she was saying no names, no names.  The reason
being that she was one of the people who drank at SWUUSI.  I hope she
doesn't get caught.  We also voted on people to be on the YAC
committee.  I was nominated, and gave my little speech, which Ginnie
liked, but I didn't make it.  I was surprised, but not too upset.
Then we got ready for the river cruise.  I almost went with someone
that I don't know if I could strust to keep out of trouble.  It was
probably going to be daring for me.  But, I ended up not going with
her.  I went instead with another guy and a whole bunch of girls.  We
went in a van.  He sat in front.  Wow.  I messed around the whole way
up there.  I'm going to make this short.  I am a week behind in this.
We went on the boat ride and I ended up with Bryn Watkins.  We went
back to the guys' hosue.  All of the teens.  Then Me, Bryn, and 3
other people went to get movies.  I sat in the back and Bryn lay back
on me.  We got The Fly, Eddie Murphy - Delerious, and The Terminator.
Either The Fly or Eddie Murphy was best.  Terminator was just sensless
killing.  Bryn was right beside me through all 3.  The Fly was not as
incredibly gross as I had heard. Some parts were pretty funny. After
the movies, the girls left.  I stayed up with Shawn McDaniel until
about 4:30.  We told jokes and he signed my tie dye shirt.  He told me
these Jokes: Koosh, Thank God, Don't Do it Again, and some Nun jokes.
I told him: Pink Gorilla, Ping Pong Balls, Frayed Not, Unitarians,
Only ones here.  I woke up at about 7:50, took a shower, and we left
for the hotel.  We went to the sanctuary and got some pictures.  We
went outside for closing circle.  We took pictures and sang.  (I need
to write some of the songs down).  We went to the sermon.  The guy up
front said he had a story and any kids could come up if we wanted.
All of us went up there.  After the sermon, we packed, hugged, kissed,
got/gave addresses, hugged, kissed, took pictures then we left.  I
kissed Bryn last.  That was the first time I kissed her.  I doubt we
will do anything.  We saw Janine and Katie on the way home.  We ate in
Lafayette together.  That was nice.  Janine has beautiful eyes.  Katie
was looking pretty, too.  They both have great smiles.  And that was
my Baton Rouge Rally.  It was great.</p>

<p class=date>8:15am Saturday 11 April 1987</p>

<p>We got here at 12:30 this morning during opening ceremony.  We sang
songs and went around the circle telling our names, where we were from
and stuff.  We split up after the rules and I played hackey sack,
frisbee, and Margaret and I had a pillow fight with a big dude named
Monte.  We worked on a puzzle and I slept at 4:00AM.  Woke up at 8:00
It's 8:25.</p>

<p class=date>April 11 1987</p>

<p>I washed up this morning in a sink.  We ate breakfast.  I helped
clean up with Catheryn, Shay, and Jennie.  Then we played butts
up. Catheryn liked it.  I was surprised.  Then we went inside and
threw a super ball around in the main room.  That was fun.  About 12
people chasing a stupid ball can get exciting.  Then we had lunch.
After that me, Catheryn, Shay, and Jennie did a half-ass job of
cleaning.  Then we were going to sleep in the chapel instead of do
workshops.  We decided not to since we weren't supposed to.  So we
went to art workshop.  I made a thing that says, "Ted's Room No Live
Cats" Then it has a peace symbol below it.  Then we played butts up
again. I got the ball stuck way up high in an air vent on the wall.
So we quit and went over to a playground for a while. That was
nice. We got to talk some then we had supper. Then we had a little
service thing.  We were all lying around and this lady was sitting in
a chair.  We all said what we had to say if we wanted. It was like
telling the editor of a paper what's on your mind.  She would add to
it or say something about it if she wanted. Then we tied-dyed.  I did
a T shirt and some underwear. I'm wearing the undies now. Then we went
to Rocky Horror. At first I was just going to wear my hair back and
ragged out clothes. As I was getting ready, everyone else was. But
then I finished and everyone else kept on. Hair was going crazy, faces
were painted, sexy clothes went on. People were all asking, "that all
you gonna do?"  I finally figured I didn't have enough. That's when I
met Kelly Hugget.  Her hair was all crazy, and she was giving this
dude a big hair spike. I asked her to do my hair and she said sure. As
I was waiting, Shay put eyeliner on me.  Then Kelly was done and she
was trying to figure out what to do with mine. Then she said, "Liberty
Spikes!" I was all yeah!  Then she did it. I looked awesome. Everyone
that saw me was saying, "cool man! that's great!" My dad saw it and he
tripped. He got the camera and everything and started clickin'. Then I
was done.  The spikes were bullet proof. Tough dudes. Then I got an
ankh and a pentogram on my cheeks. Then we went. I went with Catheryn,
Shay, and Jennie. It was pretty cool. I stood out so much that one of
the cast asked me how many times I had done it. I lied, "one," and she
looked surprised. She probably thought I was an old timer to
these. She needed more cast members to help her do it. I lied 'cause I
thought she wanted to sell me as a virgin. No way would I do that. But
all the virgins just went up to the front and got taught the
Time-Warp. Then we yelled "Virgins!" at them. I thought the movie was
cool but it got bad reviews from the real non-virgins. Oh well. We got
back and had initiations. Most of them were dull. There were a few
good ones though. At first we did one at a time. Then two. The last
one was 3 people. I initiated the last pair. I had my Spikes and some
dumb little glasses on.  I almost cracked up. Troy wanted to do the
last with three people.  Kelly was one of the singles that got
initiated.  When she was done, I sorta motioned for her to come to me.
She sat beside me, and we started talking.  We got closer and
closer... All the time she was telling me about her adventures in the
"waiting" room. She was telling me how she tried to get out and how
she got everyone to jump the doorman.  I said I could have contained
her.  She asked how and i said I would lie on her or something.  Hint,
Hint. Initiations finished at about 2:30AM. After that Kelly washed
the stuff out of my hair.  As she was doing this, I told her about my
canoe adventure during spring break. Then she washed her hair.  We
were walking around for a while trying to figure out if we wanted to
sleep or have fun.  We went outside awhile and I started to tell her
about my entire Spring Break, not just canoeing.  The she got cold, so
we went inside to the hall.  I finished telling her about my Spring
Break.  When we first went into the hall, we sat side by side with our
backs on the wall. As we talked, I turned to lean against her
shoulder.  Then I lay my head on her leg and she played with my hair.
My dad walked by a few times.  Joel went by once and turned the lights
off as he left.  He said, "just kidding" and turned them back on.  We
said "no, that's alright" and he left them off.  Then we both lay down
on our sides facing eachother...real close.  We told some jokes, then
she got her sleeping bag.  I was lying on my back when she returned.
She put it over me and got under lying on her stomach so that we could
kiss.  We were Frenching awhile and then I pulled her on top of me
completely.  We kept on and on.  Then she rolled us both over so I was
on top.  We kept going and we just fell asleep.  Not that it was
boring.  We got about 30 minutes of sleep from 6:30 to 7:00. We woke
up and dazed for a while.  I fell asleep for a bit and woke up when
she kissed me on the cheek.  I smiled and she smiled back.  I know she
liked that night.  Then we got up, washed up, and started to pack
up. I took some pictures of everyone. I got some business cards to put
addresses on. I got Shay's, Cathryn's, and Jennie's.  I sat in a chair
waiting for Kelly to come by so I could get hers.  I saw her and
motioned for her to comve over.  She did and sat in my lap.  I gave
her a card and asked for her address.  She wrote Ted Nugen down and I
ended up giving her mine.  She wrote hers on the 3 cards I had... Her
name on one, address on the 2nd, and City/state on 3rd.  People
started congregating in the YRUU room, so we went too. We sang some
stuff, Troy did a little thing that cracked me up. He put his palm
down on the floor and with his other hand he "wound" his thumb
up. Then he let go and his hand started flipping back and forth. It
was hilarious. I heard a few good jokes, and then we were all called
outside for closing ceremony. We got in a big circle and sang our
songs, did Colorado hug, yelled Bish Bish, and got pictures taken. I
had to leave soon after that. I hugged everyone and promised
letters. I forgot that I was still wearing a ring a leather bracelet
of Kelly's.  Then I left, wearing my tie dyed underwear over my pants.
I slept about 5 hours on the way home.  Jenny Venier and Emily Kerman
went with us.  When i got home, Kelly had called, asking for her ring
and bracelet back.  I called her, and we talked awhile.  She said she
was going to GA and SWUUSI She said she would try to come to the
Houston Rally.  I said I would write her a big letter along with her
ring and bracelet.</p>
