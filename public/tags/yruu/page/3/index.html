<p class=date>Monday 3 August 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>On the ground below I can see huge block letters of green (trees?) on brown dirt background:

<pre>LUECKI</pre>

<p>I wonder what the heck it means (city name?) or where it is...

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>We've been flying for about an hour and I'm seeing some intricate roadways that look like an old circuit board.  Pretty cool, but the weird thing is they don't see to go anywhere. The road ends, but there's nothing there.

<p>But I'm writing now because I think I just saw a particle accelerator, though I don't know of any in this area.  It was perfectly round, not cleared in the middle, and big. I don't really have a way to judge how big, but I'd guess 1/2 mile to a mile across.

<p>(I asked the pilot about it as I left. He didn't know for sure, but suggested it was a mine.  hmmm.)

<p class=date>12:13pm Friday 31 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>Welp, we're on the way back home from SWUUSI. I was kinda in a grouchy mood when I woke up this morning after missing the talent show last night. Fricke et.al. had written a song for SWUUSI and fuck I missed it and they are graduating. 

<p>But I felt way better with all the love and hugs and happy happy joy joy throughout the camp, and signing mugbooks and taking pictures and all the fun.

<p>We had closing circle and the seniors, instead of screaming Bish Bish again, busted out with

<p>ROW ROW ROW YOUR BOAT!
<br>GENTLY DOWN THE STREAM!
<br>MERRILY MERRILY MERRILY MERRILY!
<br>LIFE IS BUT A DREAM!!!

<p>and it was so funny after the conversation last night!
I sense a new tradition happening soon.

<p>I also got great kudos from Nathan about my ad lib worship last night for the seniors. They really liked my work and I feel great!

<p>On the way home the funniest thing was Wende asking Nick, a vegan, "okay, do you want to go to Pit Bar-B-Q or Jake's Steaks for lunch??"

<p>She drove most of the way home and then I drove from just past Centerville the rest of the way in.

<p class=date>3am Friday 31 July 1998</p>
<br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>I got super hugs when I went back to the main cabin after "my first shower since Sunday morning!" "Yay Rob!" and hugs all around.

<p>Played koosh with Clark, Jessica, Nathan Sexton, and Bryn and others before dinner.  Gave advisors Mary Angel and Dorian back massages and then it was time for worship.

<p>I had been asked to lead a senior circle through some type of guided mediation. I wrote down the words to the 1996 OKC Rally song and started my part of the worship by singing it.

<p><font size=-1>to the tune of <em>A few of my favorite things</em></font>

<p>Boogers on buttcracks and dead charred wet monkeys
<br>Gabe with Guy Parkhurst make talent shows funky
<br>Cannibal inbreds with crack pipes and beer
<br>These are what made OKC Rally dear

<p>Sardines for hours and football for longer
<br>Talkin' and chillin' make friendships all stronger
<br>Walking to Rest and the bombed building here
<br>These are what made OKC Rally dear

<p>chorus:
<br>When the coffee's gone
<br>When the rally ends
<br>When you're feelin' sad
<br>Just you remember your OKC friends
<br>And then you'll start feelin' rad!

<p>Bonding with old friends and learning some new names
<br>Bluejean adornment and cheap corny mind games
<br>Special Ed tunes that we all love to hear
<br>These are what made OKC Rally dear

<p>(chorus)

<p>Then I was all, "each rally has its song, but the songs just weren't written.." I reminded them of various memorable events that have happened at rallies in the past few years, bringing laughter and good memories to the group.

<p>I described how life will be different after YRUU but there are young adult groups "throughout the continent... Canada" I added that on for Anna and they knew.

<p>I had them call into the circle the names of some youth who have graduated before them.. any youth that has touched them in some way.. and they did.

<p>I encouraged them to feel the tightness and safety of the container, and to know it is always available- just a phone call or email or snail mail away.

<p>Then Bix had the rest of the group give a giant big group hug and all was good and all were chillin' and then they yelled Bish Bish.

<p>Bish Bish is the name of a chant of profanities often saved for highly emotional moments such as this. I personally find nothing wrong with it, but I know some people have different ideas about what language is appropriate... especially screamed outside after 1 am.

<p>We walked back without incident and most everyone assembled for the talent show. Kris and Aaron were up on stage and Steve hopped up there and stopped the show.  "Okay, we need to have a meeting. Get everyone in here and let's meet."

<p>Basically he said the youth broke the rule previously set about maintaining quiet hours after 11pm and he wanted to know how to keep that rule from being broken again.

<p>For 1.5 or 2 hours the group deliberated on the appropriate course of action. Down down down the sleepy tubes went the conversation, but in the end the youth made clear decisions about what they would do to rectify the current situation and keep it from happening again, and to stop any problems that result later from this particular instance.

<p>At the end, Drake complimented our process and suggested only that we send about 3 youth to be trained as facilitators so this kind of discussion can go more smoothly in the future.

<p>I was too sleepy to stay up for the talent show after that, and in retrospect, I wish I had. On the way back, Jeremy said the senior circle that I led was fabulous and he and Nathan wanted to be sure I knew the fault was in no way mine.  I appreciated his words.

<p class=date>early Thursday 30 July 1998</p>
<br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>Super tired waking up this morning but opening circle and then breakfast was good pancakes and stuff then I couldn't stay awake for Drake's Theme Workshop so I went back to bed.

<p>Woke up for lunch around 2pm, missing "Whack The YAC" which I didn't entirely mind since I didn't want to get whacked, whatever that might entail.

<p>Then the themed Gansta Lunch, serving Soup Doggie Dog, Method Manwich, Notorious BLT, and to drink Wu-Tang and Ice-T with Ice Cubes.  I notice we didn't have any Vanilla Ice cream.

<p>Then at 3pm we zipped off via buses to the main activity of the day, social action work at the city of Ardmore. I grabbed my towel and sunscreen and hopped on the first bus, which was pretty full, but Nathan motioned for me to come sit by him in Jessica's seat. 

<p>Sat and talked and played and the ride wasn't too far, but once we got to where we were going, funny was, "hey a train!" I yelled, referring to 1 engine with 1 car driving up to the RR crossing, causing the arms to go down and then it stopped and zipped backwards to pick up 1 more car!

<p>My touchgroup's job (I haven't been to a single touch group meeting) was to help clean up behind a house thing with 30 years worth of debris collected behind it - car hoods, a car roof, a syringe, old birdbaths, bones, old carpet, fully intact fully rotted sections of fence, car engine parts, car tires and brush and trees up to about 4 inches in diameter plus 1 log about 8 feet long and 1 foot in diameter, so rotted that it was light enough for two people to carry...  

<p>And we saved the metal and tires and concrete birdbaths, but threw the rest away into a huge dumpster like 7 feet tall by 7 feet wide and 20 feet long (and started to fill another smaller dumpster.. We cleared about a 50 by 50 square foot section of land behind this place from all this overgrown craziness down to essentially bare dirt.  Wow.  Got into the local paper with pictures and everything.

<p>Good hard work and carried away the trees that our leader guy chainsawed and it was all good.

<p>Birdbaths were there because the building behind the building used to make them.

<p>Cleaned up my hands and face and head and then piled back onto the buses to ride to Shoney's and sat by Shawn Oiler, then sat in the very back of Shoney's after being the first one to walk in, "I'd like a table for 80 please."  "Go right on to the back," and they had a section blocked off ready for us.

<p>I sat in the back corner and Josh, Jessica, and Laura sat with me. Jessica taught us a rhythmic cup clap tap thing and we practiced and learned it and will do it at the talent show tomorrow night.

<p>We all performed the sufi dance from the previous night while waiting for service. 

<p>Lotta fun and laughs and sign language as Josh got jinxed and couldn't talk until someone spoke his name, but he was as expressive through sign language as anyone else might be verbally. 

<p>I ate four plates from the salad bar and Josh didn't get his food until it was time to go.

<p>Back to the buses I sat in the back and bounced and played, "it's been 10 or 11 years since I've been on a bus! I'm sittin' in the back!" I exclaimed to Nathan who said something crazy like, "advisors don't sit in the back!"

<p>Sat by Laura and we practiced the cup thing and re-enacted the sufi dance even again and waved to cars through the back window. That wasn't totally fun since it was too dark to see their reactions.

<p>Back to camp and then worship was a Love Feast "the rules are you cannot talk, and you cannot feed yourself" and Jason fed me a marshmallow pile and I took forever chewing that. The worship was short and sweet and then it was time for me to rove again.

<p>20 youth were playing Capture the Flag; 21 youth were at the lake; and various others were scattered throughout the camp and finally I accounted for everyone and found a youth who was not feeling too good. This youth suffered from a broken heart and I sat and listened to the story.

<p>Then Travis asked if I would shave his head and I agreed (I knew from previously that his mom had said it was okay) and as we walked to the cabin to shave his head I was invited to play Silent Football. Cool.

<p>So I carefully shaved his head and was certain to put shoes on before throwing the hair out in the woods. Then I joined the game with Nick Carter as Mr Dictator, who allowed individual players to slightly change their names, which got me 1/2 of a penance point as I called Sister Maia "Ms Maia" instead.

<p>Kris Scott as "Father Scott" was hilarious acting all holy and righteous and stuff and Nick took two pictures of him during his righteous tirades. The game deteriorated as all kinds of rules were broken and I couldn't begin to keep up with everything and I was getting pretty tired, so I left the game around 5am to sleep.

<p>Woke up before opening circle and wrote notes from the previous day and just now wrote all this during breakfast though I was really hungry and ready to eat.

<p class=date>7pm Thursday 30 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>Wow holy cow went to breakfast and then Drake's workshop and back to the cabin and was just about to hop into the shower when someone walked in. I went to see who it was: a woman, a new face, so I said "HI" and then realized holy cow it's Karen!!

<p>big big big hugs and we briefed one another on our respective weeks so far and sat down to talk and stuff and after about 5 or 8 minutes she said simply, "are you okay?  you seem sad."

<p>Now, she is the nth person to say this lately and I was all, "????".  . .   So I settled into my emotions and Manda came up. I would like to date her but cannot since she is dating someone else. I feel all confused and in love with Manda, but trying not to piss off Wende and I just don't know what to do. So we went for a walk.

<p>On the way toward the main cabin I saw Janette (and her delightful braces), who I met and flirted with at the Young Adult retreat back in May. I told her I was going for a walk.

<p>She attempted to acknowledge what I said, "do I wanna go for a walk?"

<p>"No, I'm going for a walk," <em>stab - twist - salt</em> and then I thought <em>oh god that sounded terrible</em> and I didn't know what to say.

<p>But Karen and I walked and talked and she listened well and I made the realization that I want to get married so the woman I marry can take care of me, instead of me taking care of myself.

<p>wow. I replaced those thoughts with affirmations
<br>I do not need someone else to take care of me.
<br>I can take care of myself.
<br>I can nurture myself and love myself.
<br>I do nurture and love myself.

<p>More big hugs and then back to the main camp where Janette was no longer. Karen asked if I would call her if I needed to talk more.. I said probably not, but I heard and appreciate the invitation.

<p>Hugs and she left and I ate lunch. There I saw Jason Fricke's mom and told her how cool Jason was. She made my day, saying that I've really made a positive difference in Jason's life.  Yay!

<p>then I saw ohmygosh Colleen Crotty and Meghan Cusack and other junior high youth from the main camp, just over to check out the high school camp. I said HI to them and to Barbara, who said the girls now wished they had chosen the high school camp instead of junior high.

<p>Some of the youth asked if I would go swim, and I readily agreed and went down to the lake. On the way there, Nathan tried to get me to lead a junior high pack of youth and I was all, "no way; I'm goin' swimming!" and he's all "what kind of advisor are you?"  I immediately replied, "high school!"

<p>Okay that may have been cold, but it sure fit.

<p>At the lake, Wende rode around in the water on my back and then Jason was on my shoulders and we had chicken fights.  He and I pretty much kicked ass many times in a row until I was finally too sore to keep it up.

<p>After swimming we attended a workshop called "Power Shuffle" which, oh my goodness-- if you ever get a chance to do it, do it.
Major major powerful emotions and tears and tears and love and a greatly tightened community at the end.

<p>Enormous hugs to Anna to whom I had written a letter during Drake's workshop and hugged lotsa youth and then Amy Moran walked up. 

<p>"We found some baby birds and one has been injured."

<p>Went to see what they had and it turns out they had found small ducklings that were plenty able to walk and squeak and take care of themselves... 'cept that there was no parent duck in sight.  Hmmm.

<p>I suggested leaving them alone so we did.

<p>Now it's shower time for me.  First time since Sunday morning.

<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>During Sean's Hair and Foot Washing Workshop, I got my hair washed by Anna Magwood and Katy Robinson and my feet washed by Josh Voyles.  The nurturing attention was wonderful.

<p>I was pretty well sunburned today with all my time spent at the lake, even though I started the day with SPF 50. Maybe it wasn't as waterproof as I hoped.

<p>Inside I made a yarn noodle thing that looked somewhat like a chinese finger trap, but didn't really work as one.  Then dinner of nachos and lots of cheese.

<p>Then went swimming again for about 2+ hours.  As it began to get dark outside, I herded the youth toward shore. I was just about to send them out of the water (youth had made a rule that there had to be two advisors for anyone to swim at night) when a flashlight came walking down toward the beach.

<p>"Are you an advisor???" yelled about 1/2 the youth.

<p>"Yeah."  It was Dorian.

<p>"Yayyayaayyayayay!!!! and they broke the invisible barrier past me toward deeper water. 

<p>I commented something to Dorian like, "look how popular you are!"

<p>We talked and listened and affirmed one another around our various life issues. I told her about Warrior stuff and how my dad and I have had a much fuller relationship since our work together in that organization. She certainly understood since she had been super close with Karen while Karen was in YRUU.

<p>Now I'm back at the main cabin writing this.  Worship soon at the lake and then I rove from midnight to 4am.

<p><hr>

<p>4:30am Wednesday 29 July 1998

<p>Worship = circle hug everyone else and then a Sufi chant/dance and then verbal kudos about the week so far.

<p>Roved with no worries then said HI to Kris and Aaron. Now bed.

<p>Missed Spirit Circle tody and I certainly didn't want to do that; I had wanted to compliment the youth on how well they are drinking plenty of water and to keep it up.

<p>I did make breakfast though, and then Drake Baer (theme speaker) workshop, during which I wrote a mythical story about how The Feel Good Net got started.

<p>Morning workshops and then I went swimming from 1:25pm to essentially now.  Played with Jason some but had to leave to take Debi's car back (said Wende) even though I was wet and Wende was dry, but I took her car back and walked back to the lake with Frank and two beach balls. Drake started to walk with us, but by about 1/2 way there, he turned back, realizing the sun was just going to be too much for his New Jersey acclimated self.

<p>Jason left by the time I got back and I felt some sadness; I still wanted to play!

<p>Instead played a small game of bouncing one of the balls with Andy Andrews (advisor) and then we began collecting small rocks from the bottom of the lake. He identified them to the best of his knowledge. Most of them were some type of sandstone. We also found some opaque smokey quartz. Jessica came over and helped us collect some, and we put them all on the dock for safe keeping.

<p>Also found a stick that looks not entirely like a turtle head when it is poking out of the water.

<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>This morning, Jason and I played lots in the lake again, chicken fights and acrobatics of whatever sort we could come up with including Jessica on Jason's shoulders while Jason on my shoulders. We tried some 6-person pyramids, but couldn't get them to work.

<p>We played keep away from Maia with Maia's hat and sunglasses. Actually I did play a bit, but tried to keep the group to remain respectful of her stuff.

<p>Then I took a phat nap before lunch.

<p>Water activity workshop after dark designed by Jen Colbert, included water balloon tossing and a big slip-n-slide.  Frank and I used raquet looking things each with a net to catch the balloons. I think we did quite well considering how dark it was.

<p>Ate plenty of ice cream after dinner.

<p>Then worship led by Tiffany Schneider was basically "break up into groups and talk about your beliefs." I expressed pretty verbosely what I believed and how my beliefs had changed throughout the years.  Afterward, I felt honored when Sean Murray said, "I had always wondered what Rob believed."  Wow.

<p>Back to main cabin for more ice cream and I loved sitting with an informal group listening to <a href="https://www.geocities.com/sunsetstrip/studio/4367">Kris Scott</a> live in concert, guitar and singing his various favorites and taking requests. He is really good and I look forward to seeing his performance career develop beautifully, not to mention purchasing his third tape when it comes out.

<p>Swam after dark and Susan accompanied me both to and from the lake. On the way up there, she held my hand and looked up at the stars the entire way there. On the way back, I held her hand and walked with my eyes closed the entire way back.

<p>Said HI to Chris Anderson, who had a CD pumping loudly from his car.  A german band with a name I can't begin to remember, but which he could pronounce surprisingly well.

<p>Bed now.

<p class=date>am Monday 27 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>The same night after Jessica hit her head and we sent her to bed, Elizabeth (an advisor) asked if I would shave the back of her head with my clippers.  No problem!

<p>I clipped it as she requested and was walking in the dark toward the bushes to throw it away when 
<font size="+3" color="FF0000"><em>BAM!!</em></font> something clamped onto my toe and burning poison seared through like red hot electrocuting pliers biting through OHMYGOD that hurts get-it-off-get-it-off and I scraped my foot upside down to knock off whatever animal had so effectively stung me DAMN!!

<p>Back to the lighted area and nothing was on my foot, nor had been when I scraped it but oh my god my second smallest left toe screamed with agony.

<p>Amazed, I walked over to Arlene and Steve. Limping did not help; the pain ripped through me anyway. "Hi. Um, I got stung my something on my foot, and it really really hurts."

<p>Bix, Rafael, and Charlotte were quite loving and attentive as I sat wide eyed on the bench, repeating, "this pain is amazing," as Bix offered her hand for me to squeeze.  As other youth found out, they asked about my foot and gave consolations.

<p>Soon, the lymph node inside my left thigh began to hurt, and my lips began to tingle as my toe and foot were tingling. Wow. 
In describing the pain to someone, and given the injury and stuff, it was determined I had been stung by a scorpion.

<p>Limped to bed (okay maybe it did help) and Wende brought my pillow and stuff. I slept through the night to 8am, missing my 4am-8am roving shift. Thank you, other advisors.
