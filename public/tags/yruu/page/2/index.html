                        <p><title>Little Rock Rally</title></p>

<p class=date>4-6 December 1998</p>

<p>Leaving Houston at 9:30am, I drove kT Hammons and Nicole Mauldin up to Tulsa to pick up Frank Roesler and Eryn Pope.  I had forgotten to get a map to the Tulsa church, but we stopped by a McDonald's and used their phone book and figured it out.

<p>Said HI to Ashley Robinson, Stacey Craig, and a couple others after I took a quick nap at the Tulsa church. Then we were on our way after a quick stop at Wendy's for food.

<p>Frank cracked me up and I almost snarfed with his hilarious beat box sounds. Had to be there.

<p>Got to Little Rock at about midnight.  Signed in and hugged and said HI to everyone and opening circle Matt and Mari Mock and Gene Hudnall and Nick Gruenewald made all the announcements and stuff.  A game of Mafia followed, and it was super cool because we who were Mafia, happened to all be right next to each other in the circle!  (Except for 1 person who we killed first)

<p>It was me, Eryn Pope, Bryan Beck, Danny K, and uh oh.. I'm in trouble. I don't remember who else was mafia.  Mafia won, since Bryan volunteered himself to die and threw off the whole group.

<p>Then I did sleep sleep sleep almost through breakfast and then watched Pulp Fiction and then hung out on the porch with Bryan and Eryn near JoEllen's spirituality workshop.  Aaron Ivener showed up with one of his friends a chatted for a bit.

<p>Yoga workshop then massage workshop, where I volunteered to be massaged by the woman doing the workshop. Yay!

<p>Eryn and I played with Jenga blocks, seeing how high we could stack them.  Then a dude whose name I forgot brought a bunch of drums and stuff and taught us some beats and a dance and all kinds of fun.

<p>Then Nick G stacked up the Jenga blocks in the highest stack we had been able to do and we took some pictures of it.  I went to bed, but apparently he placed one of those black music stands on top of it!  There are rumors that he got a picture of it, and other rumors that it fell off and hit him on the head first.

<p>Slept through talent show (sorry, guys) and no Silent Football (you could have played without me!) and woke up at 4am for a brief walk around the church then back to bed for a few hours.

<p>Slept through cleanup and then we snagged breakfast and closing circle sang Yogi Bear and good friends and stuff.

<p>Bright yellow covers on the mugbooks, but I've lost mine before I could put it in the Big Gray Rally Book. Pooh.  Wonderful fun rally!

<p class=date>15 November 1998</p>
<br><font size="-1">(transcribed from my diary)</font>

<p><em>En route</em> to Tulsa. I'm driving Denise's van, and Denise & kT are asleep.  Adam is silently reading in the back. I'm in a reflective mood... healthy contemplation of my life after reading so much of <em>Science of the Gods</em>. OKC is 48 miles away.

<p>The book describes a physics that I don't really care about but I've been enjoying the paranormal and unusual events and stuff it has described.

<p>Most intriguing to me now is the life of the plant kingdom, with faeries, and elves, and the god Pan described and the devas that are the architects of each different type of plant and stuff. I can meditate and receive the gift of how to care for the lush green plant in my sunroom.

<p>I am pretty darn super excited about FlashNet! I wrote 8 emails this morning and called Carrie and Wende.  That's 10 contacts. I've got 70+ names of my friends on my list that I started last night.  And it's so wacky that I just say, "if you know someone who needs access, let me know!"

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>4:29pm Friday 13 November 1998 (10460) [note: that's how many days old I am this day]

<p>I'm driving on "something Turner Turnpike" maybe, and it's 90 miles to Tulsa and 30 miles to "free restrooms" and 45 miles to toll plaza. At least this was true 3 miles ago when I started writing. I have to pee.  That was true when I started driving over 1 hour ago.

<p>I hope the youth embrace the license plate frames that I made and am bringing. I woulda liked them better if the big bar was on the bottom.

<p>When I get back from Tulsa I'm going to make more flashnet contacts and order business cards and stuff. When I get back from Costa Rica, it's no holds barred crazy flashnet mania at my house.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>Iraq war may happen again over weapons inspection. NPR was all talkin' about it.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>Midnight Friday night 13 Nov 1998 (10461 on Saturday)

<p>Found my mom and Jon and hugged and called Delayna and Janette called back and I thought it was Delayna and stuff and was surprised that she needed directions to the church but gave them to her but she never showed up (Janette (nor Delayna)).

<p>Took Denise to hotel and called Delayna and figured out my error. Back to Hope Church and talked to Eric Posa and Gayle Keen.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>7:15am Saturday 14 November 1998

<p>Last night we played Silent Football until 3am.

<p>I was dictator, with Jeremy L-N, Bryn C, Noah W, Leslie A, Ellen S, Nathan R, Adam W. Adam kept yakking and had a clear win at first but he got to 4.5 and I was just about to begin play and he kept his hand up. I was all, "Mr Adam has <em>four point five</em> points... Mr Adam." and within 10 seconds he lost.

<p>Ellen was super impressive at her knowledge of pronouns. And her memory in general was most impressive.

<p>Katy A had started playing but bowed out due to tiredness.

<p>Bryn wrote a most beautiful most flattering Ode to Rob in the Big Gray Rally Book. I was so touched.  I may scan it and put it in here.

<p>Adam has to do a report on either UU Software workshop, or all 3 workshops that he attends.

<p>We got about less than 3 hours of sleep. As the lights were off and we were layin' there, the youth kept yakking and I was all "okay everyone count silently to 100 and when you get to 100 start over."  Silence.
<br>Then Jeremy was all, "starting over"
<br>Laughter
<br>Silence
<br>Golden sleep

<p>Oh, the funniest thing: "in an unprecedented move, Mr Dictator awares Mr Jeremy 1/2 of one penance point for ..., awards Ms Bryn 1/2 of one penance point ..." and I went around the entire circle giving each player 1/2 penance point for the specific "crime" that person had been committing.

<p>Right now I'm at the service sitting beside Katy from Dallas First Church. The license plate frames are selling relatively well.  :-)  Nice.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>2nd workshop. All the youth (almost) are here at the Spirituality workshop with Austin Roth and JoEllen Willis.  Wild to be here finally; I have anticipated this workshop for a long time, like since May at least.

33<p><hr width="20%">

<p>10am Sunday 15 November 1998 (10462)

<p>We're at OKC church after a crazy fun game of Silent Football last night where I finally suspended the game while it was all crazy and said, "YO are we playing a strict game or a crazy game?"
<br>Austin indicated clearly to Jermey that J-man was too disruptive. Game went much more smoothly after that.

<p>Nathan lost and had to fix us breakfast.

<p>This morning we left around 8 and are now at youth group at OKC. They have a cool phat room.

<p>In attendance I know Adam L, Rebecca, Devon A, Austin R, Melissa C, Bryn C, Annie B.  Class has included a Korean man named Peter who is showing us breathing techniques.

<p>Bryn C was the first volunteer.  I was impressed with her seriousness.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>2:55pm 15 November 1998

<p>kT and I are at ACE of Clubs, as the van developed a slightly flat tier. It's only flat (although completely flat) on the bottom. We began walking at 2:20pm and found a guy at the car wash who is taking Denise and Adam to the van and to Texaco to get the flat fixed. kT and I had the option to gow with them, but have chosen to chill here with our red plastic cups of Coke and birthday woman behind the counter with voice so scratchy it almost hurts me and she's got 3 packs of Misty brand cigarettes and said, "can hardly breathe...so I'll just smoke a cigarette..." and just now said "she got a flat tire on I-35 and...I gave her 10 bucks blah blah blah" From context, I can tell it's not Denise to whom she is referring.  {HACK HACK HACK} "Really I don't have TB or nothin'"    
<br>So much make up and "woke up this morning and saw that fifth of tequila and I was all 'I'm gonna drink it' then I was all 'no I'm not I gotta work.. dammmmn!"
<br>"Girls just wanna have fun" she struts about last night and her black bra is so visible through see-through mosquito netting shirt. "gonna drink that and gonna drink some Jack and gonna drink some tequila..."

<p>I simply don't understand this lifestyle.

<p>On other weird thing is this bar is in a small shopping center with a chiropractor, a speech & occupational & physical therapy center, and a counseling center or something. Wacky.
kT says it's a front.

<p>3:45pm they just got back and Adam sat up beside me at the bar and she just told Adam that he had to be 21 to sit at the bar and kT has been there for 50 minutes.

<p>Now Adam and Denise are playing pool. We are waiting for the wrecker guy who had to go get a new tire from somewhere.

<p>kT got a picture of them playing pool. "Blackmail!  This is going on the internet!"

<p>The peoples around the bar have shifted over to the other side. I wonder if they are consciously or subconsciously moving away from us.

<p><font size="+1">Oh my gosh yesterday Delayna came over to the cabin to hang out with me! I haven't seen her in ten years!  Met her husband and Skye Blu, her little baby!! So great to reconnect with her and stuff.</font>
<br>Never saw Janette. Pooh.

<p>kT is line dancing alone. I guess that is point dancing.

<p><hr width="20%">

<p>2:30 am Monday 16 November 1998 (10463)

<p>Woke up at Denton and drove the rest of the way straight home.  No stops from Denton to Houston.

<p>Goodnight.

                        <p><p>1998 San Antonio rally review by Annie Bricker</p>

<hr>

<p><p><pre></p>

<p>Damn, over a hundred people going to your average rally and not one of
them has written a review since OKC 98.  That&rsquo;s terrible people!<br />
anyway, got back from the San An Rally yesterday so I am going to write
about it before the memories begin to fade.  And yes, contrary to
popular belief, i do more at rallies than just stay with Nick Carter.<br />
The trip to San An was alright, if not long.  We stopped at a McDonalds
on the way where i saw Eryn Pope order the first vegetarian
cheese-burger i have ever seen.  Amazingly enough the cashier didn&rsquo;t
give any strange looks or anything.  We drove through San Marcos Texas
for some reason along the way although i am almost positive that it is
really really not on the way from OKC to San Antonio.  We were softly
serenaded by the melodious rhythms of SCOTT&hellip;.(hey you, fuck you).  And
speaking of scotts, where was Scotty H. and for that matter Paul M.?<br />
Anyway, we got there and piled out of the van (of course i jumped out
and on to those really fucking hard rocks in the parking lot of the San
An church) and did our various registration things.  Which, by the way,
included getting your name written on your arm in red marker, something
which, i thought, was a really good idea, so if you have forgotten
someone&rsquo;s name since the last time you saw them and you don&rsquo;t want to
make a complete ass of yourself, you can just quickly glance down at
their arm. So Jo-Jo registered us and someone i forgot whom (sorry to
that person/people) took our individual pictures with this really cool
looking digital camera and we got our t-shirts.  which were pretty cool
with all the shrooms and the slug with the hook.  So, we had come a bit
late, but just in time for opening circle.  And damn, i remember being
there, but all i can remember is that they announced the touch groups
and i forgot whose i was in and had to go searching around for the
group.  I finally found them by the trees in the play ground.  We didn&rsquo;t
do any of the touch group games, cause hell, lets be honest, there are
better things to at a rally than play a game called &ldquo;Knock Your Socks
Off&rdquo; with a group of mostly barefooted people.  Lauren told us that our
jobs were lunch clean up and bathroom clean up (sounds great huh,) and
then we slowly dissipated into the collective smoke break group forming
by the basket ball courts.  Around 4 am i found my self laying in a pile
of Christina, Dane, John and some other people.  All this was well and
good, however, now that i have slept a bit, i don&rsquo;t really remember how
I got there.  Anyway, at this point some people decided to take the big
metal bar dome type thing whose name i don%27t know, and put it over
Eric.  this happened (with a bit of stepping over sean) and about ten
people climbed on top so when eric woke up he was surrounded by a dome
of people.  Rob was ready with the camera when Eric woke up with a
bewildered &ldquo;What the fuck&rdquo; kind of look on his face.  There was pancakes
and sausage for breakfast that i skipped for some reason, though i
don%27t recall why.  I laid in the grass and listened to Lauren M play
the guitar, I listened to Evan, well, talk and watched a basketball
game.  Smoke breaks came and went.  Nick and i found the rally book and
he drew in it and then wrote the rules for the game that is more complex
than Silent Football that he and i invented called &ldquo;I Once Saw this
Woman on Jerry Springer&hellip;&rdquo;  for rules, check out the gray rally book.<br />
The mandatory smoke workshop came, even though the guy who was supposed
to talk to us from the Cancer Society didn&rsquo;t.  I thought it worked out
for the better though, cause wouldn&rsquo;t you rather talk to people you know
about smoking than have some guy you have never met come tell you stuff
that you have heard before and will hear again in any highschool health
class you ever attend?  Anyway, that went okay and then a miracle
occurred: I found an empty couch on which to sleep!  I was only meaning
to sleep for a short period of time but when i woke up and asked someone
what time it was I realized i had been asleep for 5 hours.  So, sorry,
Bryan, i really did mean to go to your workshop.  So i woke up and went
to the playground and listened to more guitar.  then lauren announced
that her dream workshop was about to start and i went to that.  It was
pretty cool, the books and stuff and Lauren did a great job.  At some
point after that i went into the Fellowship room and read some of
someone&rsquo;s poetry and realize &ldquo;oh shit, they are playing Michael Jackson,
someone change it quick&rdquo;.  then dinner&hellip;.and DAMN! that vegetarian
lasagne was good.  Had some really watered down lemonade, but that was
alright.  then a touch group meeting was announced and we all met, then
realised it was really a touch group leader meeting and not really a
touch group meeting.  But that was alright.  i danced a bit with Bryn to
some really odd sounding R&amp;B music and then washed my hair in a sink
(yay for short hair, you can wash it anywhere!)  Damn, I am babbling, i
will get to the interesting parts.  worship.  it was pretty damn cool
with everybody hugging everybody, and there are some good huggers out
there, you know who you are, and lauren on the guitar.  Talent show,
damn was that funny.  Even though Kris broke a guitar.  Andrew juggled,
Rob was &ldquo;made-up pretty&rdquo;, Rob and Nick ate boxes of Nerds, Bryan read
poetry (M-U-R-D-E-R-amen to that) Robert played the piano, many people
played the guitar, a story was told, and i think i fell asleep for
parts, but a generally managed to stay kind of conscious.  We began to
be swept away by hurricane-like weather so i ended up sleeping inside by
the kitchen.   It was still raining in the morning so we didn&rsquo;t get to
burn the shroom like we were going to but hell, it is all metaphorical
anyway.  Breakfast was doughnuts, how familiar:)  i finally got to write
in the rally book, and read Bryns thing about &lsquo;non-sleep&rsquo; vs sleep.<br />
closing circle,  the beaver song, the walrus song (really, a beaver is
not a sea faring animal like a walrus is, it was just a funny intro) the
banana song, senior circle (bish kinda got messed up but it worked) and
the yackty yaks and mug books were given out (btw, that camera has some
fucking good quality) and then we all had to leave.  the ride home was
alright, but crowded as shit.  And there you have it, a really long
winded rally review.  and you can do one too.  really, it is easy.  i
didn&rsquo;t even break a nail.

<p>so i got inspired</p>

<p>leaving school on friday was a pain in the ass, but katie and danny k and
i got through it. (don&rsquo;t get confused, danny k was just visiting, he
doesn&rsquo;t go to my school) there was some craziness getting everyone
together and into the van, but we(me, katie carson, danny k, ian coward,
and matt luria, and me momma) finally left tulsa at about 4:00 in the
nippy grayness of afternoon. we got a little lost, and someone who will
go unnamed kept making references to the idea that i was a really bad
navigator, which made me really mad mad mad, but then there was almost
constant silliness with me and katie and ian and danny k, so it all
evened out. so&hellip;&hellip;.we got to the rally at about 3:30 and got ourselves
registered. i got hugs from all sorts of crazy loved peoples, poking a
more than a few in the eye with my wings in the process.heehe. my memory
is failing me&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;oh! this is making me mad!! oh- when i first got
there maia handed me this really neat book of stuff that she made. it was
really cool. and jeremy loomis-norris was there in his suave outfit bein&rsquo;
all scary and suave.then later nathan ryan and katie carson and i were
gonna watch the sunrise but something happened and we didn&rsquo;t, i think we
went inside because katie was cold. and then it was saturday morning and
i was outside with the smokers and i was on my way to brush my teeth, but
ben atkinson got me all sidetracked with this really scary little cap gun
thing. i finally escaped :) and got my teeth brushed (which is so much
harder to do at a rally than it should be) and went to do the breakfast
thing. i had some good pancakes and some cooked pig. mmmm&hellip;&hellip;.yum! and
some really wacky sunny d that was like mucus, so i didn&rsquo;t drink it.
hhhmmmmm&hellip;&hellip;..more&hellip;more&hellip;more&hellip;..look! mush for you! i remember
sitting somewhere kinda by myself and being really happy &lsquo;cause this was
my third san an and i have grown so much since then and rallies have made
all the diference in the world. yeah. oh- jeremy made me listen to this
band guster that i really liked and so i was doing some nancy dancing
with jeremy and that was good. and lunch happened somewhere in there and
it was the usual nasty sandwiches and chips that i really wish someone
would break the cycle of (hint hint). and i sat at a table and listened
to some people, i remember nathan ryan and elizabeth severance but
everyone else is kinda blurry, and people were being funny and i laughed.
there was more fun and love and silliness in this space here. and then
there was dinner and i joined a new &ldquo;club&rdquo;.heehe. and somewhere before
that ben atkinson wrestled me to the ground and phuufed me for the first
time!! i was soo mad. i was planning on maintaining my non-phuufed status
for at least another year, at least. and at worship we did a hug circle,
and people were talking and laughing and i thought that was so much
better than those hug circles we do sometimes that you can&rsquo;t really talk
or giggle at because we&rsquo;re being &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; (i think this
spiritual=quiet and contemplative is a crock of shit-excuse my
french-cause you can be very spiritual laughing until your tummy hurts)oh
well. hmmm&hellip;.more&hellip;&hellip;..the talent show was kinda scary but
interesting.steve sang rocky raccoon, which i love cause it has my name
in it :). and there was this one part with rob and my mom and make-up,
and that was scary, because within the course of it my mother was rubbing
on rob&rsquo;s chest, and man, that&rsquo;s just plain bad weird. (sorry rob, it was
my mother. ahhh!!! )and then aaron and kris did their usual oh so cute
round of songs, this time complete with &ldquo;dancing&rdquo;. i don&rsquo;t think you get
cuter than that. and lauren dodski and ellen smith sang american pie and
it made me all happy and sad and it was wonderful. and a while after that
i went to sleep. alone. in a cold room. woke up 40 min. later and found a
blanket and a pillow(someone was using my pillow and sleeping bag) and
fell asleep in the sanctuary. next thing i know shirah&rsquo;s waking me up and
there&rsquo;s clean up (how that sanctuary got clean was purely a miracle) and
donuts and closing circle and that happy sadness you get on the sunday
morn of a rally. and then there were many hugs and we got in the van and
went home. or at least back to tulsa. :)</p>

<p>love and cuteness and hugs for all of you
nancy deardorff

                        <p><title>San Antonio Rally</title></p>

<p class=date>2 November 1998</p>

<p>Here is my version of this past weekend lock-in at San Antonio with 120+ youth and a ton of fun!

<p>Here are <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998">pics from the rally</a>.

<p><hr>

<p>How incredible to think that just counting from memory, we brought more than 25 youth from Houston!  Yay! This whole Houston Network thing is working wonderfully!

<p>Youth from Emerson church collected at Emerson and waited for youth from First Church to arrive.  They had a 15 passenger van, and we had a 7 passenger..  4 advisors and 17 youth and we were on our way!

<p>We stopped more than I wanted, but got there plenty early considering how short the drive is.

<p>Bing!! We were at the rally! and I stayed up the first night until 8am!  I usually crash by like 5 or 6am for a couple of hours.  During the night I remembered or re-learned names of many youth..  It took forever to remember Joanna's but I finally did and let her know I remember by signing it out to her during opening circle. (Thanks Kathryn for teaching me the alphabet!)  I remembered Nuha Kadri's all the way back from I think Dallas Rally last year.. and I was sure to remember because she said there is no way I could do it. Ha!

<p>Um, oh one weird thing was the movie <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> it was bizarre stop action animation type stuff that reminded me of a Frank Black movie I saw some time ago. I sat and watched the end of that until like 7 am or so when it was just thinking about getting light outside.

<p>I slept from about 8:30am to 10 or so and wondered what was up when a herd of youth rumbled quietly out to the basketball court.
I took pictures as they were climbing up on the dome jungle gym over Eric Morrow.  Funny stuff!  <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/ondome.jpg">Here's a pic</a>.

<p><a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/underdome.jpg">Here</a> is Eric.

<p>Soon thereafter, for some reason I cannot explain, Sean (who was sleeping peacefully in the first pic above) and Jason were <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/jasonsean.jpg">wrestling in the grass.</a>

<p>Soon after that, Kris was up in the big tree after being chased by Sean..  I climbed up and got some pics.  <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/intree.jpg">Here's one.</a>

<p>For the next 5 or 6 hours, I was in a YAC meeting. We got a lot done and settled; we're working on getting the YAC PAC complete and making a standard way for rallies to be YAC Approved. Good stuff.

<p>After the YAC meetin' we had dinner of lasagna and I had a big enormous piece of cake. Big. Huge. Lots of icing.  :-)

<p>And then we had YAC elections, fully facilitated by the youth on YAC.  Out of 6 youth who ran, Elizabeth Severance, Adam Lock, and Melissa Cain were elected.

<p>That evening Jason Fricke and I did our <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/back_to_back.jpg">gymnastical stunts</a>
and foolin' around and it developed into a game of keep-away with the big tape ball that resulted in wadding up the tape that had been used to make the life size chess board..  I was in the YAC meeting during all that.  (Someone said it was more like a pillow fight pretending to be a chess game)

<p>I <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/rob_sleepin.jpg">took a nap</a> before the talent show.

<p>Kris Scott and Aaron Ivener performed some songs, and I totally love how they play together..  They have a connection that is wonderful as they work back and forth on stage.  Nevermind.. I can't describe it.

<p>Nick Carter and I each ate a box of Nerds.  One of the boxes that has two flavors. I think it was Grape and Watermelon.
That was quite an ordeal, but we did it!  I stayed onstage the entire time until my entire box was nothing but fiber and I swallowed the whole thing (one little bit at a time)

<p>I'm sure that was more than you wanted to hear..  

<p>Nick played a beautiful, dramatic, (improvised?) piece on the piano while he chewed his box of Nerds.</p>

<p>Also I got my face painted (mostly just a bunch of base, given the <a href="/images/YRUU/san_antonio_1998/makeup.jpg">picture</a>).  That was pretty wacky.  

<p>Oh, and just before that, Kris and I did voices for Jen and Dane for the San Antonio Saki part IV School-A-Saki, which we first did last year. I thought we did quite well; our best one yet!

<p>After the talent show we pulled together a game of Silent Football.  Yay!!

<p>I was nominated Dictator, and Jeremy, Austin, Katie, Adam, Bryn, Bryan, Chris.. man I can't remember all who played.
<br>I was very quick to call "Holy Gihad!" whenever someone even thought about messing with the group.  I called it a bit quickly on Ryan Ray, and I'm sorry about that.
<br>I'm sure there is a happy medium somewhere.

<p>So the game went on for a pretty long time and got wacked out for a while, but after Jeremy excused himself, we had a more serious (as if Silent Football can be serious) game.

<p>What was funny was I started the game with a Surge, and had my pockets stuffed with 4 other Surges. So each time I'd finish one, I open up another.  I had 6 empty in front of me by the end of the game and I HAD TO PEEEEEE!!

<p>Ahem.  So it was a pretty great game, and I pretty much went to bed right after.  My diary says I lay down at 5:40am.

<p>But I didn't sleep.  Finally I found something that kept me awake!  Six cans of Surge!  (and that was after the huge piece of cake and groovy juice (which I didn't even mention)).

<p>I lay in bed for 1 hour, including through most of cleanup, and soon ended up with Jason Fricke trying to get me up. "If I have to be up, you have to be up."   Pfshh.  yeah right.

<p>But I got up and we made some copies of the Houston Rally registration and handed them out at closing circle.

<p>This review is dragging.  We hugged, loaded up in the chilly rain and went to Taco Cabana and went home.</p>

                        <p><title>Halloween Carnival</title></p>

<p class=date>25 October 1998</p>

<p>Today at church we had our annual carnival with proceeds benefitting UNICEF.  The youth group had two tables set up: one for face painting and stuff, and the other for fake blood and bandages.

<p>They also were in charge of the jail; people could pay to have others arrested, and those who were arrested could pay to get out.

<p>At one point I was arrested "for being bald" and I walked calmly over to the jail then scampered off, with some of the youth after me. They can't arrest me!!!

<p>I ran out of the area, and jumped the chain link fence around the playground (what a good example I'm setting!) and ran around the entire church with 3 youth behind me.  My ankle was a bit sore (I hurt it last night jumping over Maggie's couch) so I couldn't run super long.

<p>So I climbed up and into the big paper recycling dumpster. I had always wanted to do that! They were right behind me and were soon at the dumpster and David and Katherine climbed in before I thought, "hmmmm, we probably shouldn't play in the paper recycling dumpster," so I calmly got out and let them lead me to the jail.

<p>Once in jail, I squirmed out a little little hole (like just over 18 inches in diameter) and they thought that was entertaining enough to let me go.  Heh.

<p>I got a picture of myself with a crazy black wig on, but I don't like it much.  You won't like it: <a href="/images/rob/ugly_black_wig.jpg">bleh</a>.

<p>I think I'll go to Walgreen's and pick up the roll of pics I mentioned in a recent entry!</p>

<p class=date>Sunday 18 October 1998</p>

<p>What a wild weekend! To give you a visual of sorts, let me say that on Friday, I shaved my head. I shaved it again Saturday morning and again this afternoon.

<p>The bulk of this weekend I spent at First UU Church of Houston with youth for Construct-O-Con, where Houston area youth gathered to design a much larger conference that will be held at my church in January.

<p>Friday afternoon before the thing, Jason Fricke called and was all, "yo, you wanna go skating?"  Yes.

<p>So he arrived at my house like around 3pm and we drove over to Hermann Park area to skate. Quite a duo we must have looked..  He was on skateboard, with shorts and white tanktop and no pads at all. I was on inline skates, fully padded, with fat knee pads, wrist guards and helmet.

<p>We mostly skated around a few steps and a couple of ramps (not designed for skating, but part of the Miller Outdoor Theater). It was just a beatiful fall day and we just experienced our own playfulness. We hardly interacted more than, "oh cool did you see that?" or "watch this..." before trying a new skill.

<p>We expanded our boundaries and I skated, jumping from bench to bench, along a sidewalk toward the Houston Zoo. By the duck lake we waved HI to the few people riding the little train around the park..  (You know, I've never ridden that train...)

<p>Oh crap.. as I'm typing I just realized I'm not writing a skating adventure; I'm writing about the whole weekend lock-in!

<p>Okay, I got a call from Christina on my cell phone and she asked for our help with the food. We had just been en route to The Medical Center (to play around more steps and stuff) when she called.  We got back to the car and I got my skates and pads off just as it started to rain.  Perfect timing!

<p>To Christina's work we picked up a big pile of food, including a tub of sugar cookie dough. Jason and I taste tested it a few times to make sure it was good.  It was good.  Yup, still good.  We were laffin', squirting dough between our teeth and having a great time!

<a name="buttsup">
<p>Then zipped to the church, dropped off the food, then to my house and got cleaned up. (We each played pinball on my computer while the other showered) To the church we arrived fashionably late and the whole group played wall ball most of the night.
"Wall ball" is essentially the same game that I played in high school called "butts up."  (*)

<p>As a group we joined the CUUPS (something UU Pagan Society) group for their worship. It focused on Samhain, "that time of the year when the veil between the physical world and the after world is the thinnest" and we all were given the opportunity to talk about people we know who have died. The sharing was a bit heavier than I expected, and though I personally felt fine afterward, some of the youth had cried about some of the deaths.. so I thought a "decompression session" would be appropriate after the worship.

<p>So we talked a bit (without the CUUPS) in our own group where I hoped the youth would feel safer to get out anything they needed to. I encouraged a couple who needed it to experience their sadness or anger or whatever, but to certainly not bottle up those emotions!

<p>I think it went well.

<p>I was up until about 3 that night; I didn't watch whatever movie they watched until 5am.

<p>Woke up, zipped home to get my cell phone charger, and used the opporunity to shower and again. I used that opportunity to shave my head again; my hair felt like sandpaper after almost 24 hours of growth.

<p>Wall ball wall ball wall ball until lunch then more more more until other youth arrived and then at about 5pm we started our rally planning.

<p>There were several new youth who had never been to a rally, so I gave an overview of them and had the experienced youth give their versions.  Then we figured out who would organize what for our rally in January.

<p>The theme will be "Fricke's Fiesta Con Queso" (for any of you YRUUers out there, this is your sneak preview) and the whole thing will be centered around Salsa, queso, and anything spanish we can think of.  We'll even look into getting sponsorship from Taco Cabana.

<p>Two hours later we had the whole overview complete, with various youth volunteers to be in charge of the various aspects, and me as overview coordinator type person. kT took notes.

<p><hr align="center" width="25%">

<p>Then some real interesting dynamics occurred when the group doubled in size on Saturday evening.  Seems that some youth had heard the lock-in was only for Saturday night.  Hmmmm.

<p>We had one more meeting planned, and wow. There was a pretty big rift between the two groups. I think it was overall handled poorly; not *all* the youth had to be at the meeting, and they certainly didn't want to be there. I have certainly learned from the experience.

<p>Then it was play wall ball, play loud music, and play movies night until 3 or 4 am.  I went to bed at about 1 and got major good sleep until I woke up at 6 from a weird dream set in Austin.

<p><blockquote><em>
We were at Austin First Church and I was wearing my Lyle Luau "Near .. Far" Grover shirt. We were in a long line to say HI to some famous DJ type guy wearing shades outside in the parking lot. He was near a fence. Somehow I was whisked forward in line; I didn't have to wait behind everyone, and he talked with me more than with anyone else. We play-danced some funny playfully overtly sexual dance move and I woke up.
</em></blockquote>

<p>I got up and surveyed the church to find everyone asleep, zonked out strewn across the floor basically in 3 rooms, mostly in the movie watching room.

<p>No one had cooked the cookie dough, so I made sure it hadn't gone bad. It hadn't, so I ate a bit more.

<p>The place was mostly clean, amazingly enough, so cleanup was not too difficult at 8am when I woke everyone up. I mostly coordinated the cleanup efforts and when it was all good, we had cereal and said our goodbyes.

<p>To church our group went by way of IHOP, where I noticed the picture of "IHOP" written in syrup on the front of the menu looks like "dOH!" upsided down. Pretty cool; try it.

<p>I was pretty doze-y during church then went home, shaved my head and slept.</p>

<p class=date>2 October 1998</p>

<p>I'm right now listening to nine inch nails' "the downward spiral" on _downward spiral_  CD.

<p>As soon as the CD ends I'm leaving to go check out a haunted house with the youth group!  There are 3 houses super close to each other near downtown on Fannin Street.  Haunted Hotel, Haunted Hotel 2, and Fear Factory.

<p>Earlier today I cruised out there to see where to park and stuff before they get all crowded.  I talked to the owner dude (owns all three) and he gave me a teeny bit of inside info - how many of what different types of animated monsters they have in which hotels and that kind of stuff. 

<p>He suggested that we start at _Fear Factory_ and we'll get discount passes to the other two.

<p>I assured him that not all of the group would want to go to all the houses, but I appreciated his offer!

<p><hr width="50%" align="left">

<p>When I worked at Telecheck, I wrote a program that calculated the number of days between any two dates.  I used it to determine how many days old I was, and determined that I turned 10000 days old on 10 August 1997.  

<p>But I quit Telecheck and had no access to the program.

<p>So my dad wrote a version for Windows!  I'll put it on here so you can download it soon.

<p>CD is over; I'm outta here!

<p class=date>9:20am Monday 3 August 1998</p>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p>I'm in seat 24A of Continental flight 1989 about to leave for ConCon. Celine Dion's "My heart will go on" is playing quietly over the speakers as two boys with English accents talk with their parents behind me, including "if I sit heah, I con't see tha TV."

<p>This weekend I got all my planned activities complete, including transcribing all my SWUUSI journal entries, updating the Houston YRUU (pronounced "why are you you" short for Young Religious Unitarian Universalists) webpage, seeing my mom preach at Thoreau Congregation, and attending the youth worship last night, during which we decided to create a Houston YAC (Youth-Adult Committee) which can make the decisions that need to be made for the YRUU activities in the Houston area.

<p>On Saturday I went to Maggie and John's and met Wende out there for dinner and ate then left around 9pm and met Manda at IHOP after going to say HI to Rebecca at Indigo Angel who wasn't there so I left a note.

<p>Manda and I went to a park and chilled and swung on swings and climbed and slid down slides and rocked on a huge rocking gazebo and talked till like 1:30am. I went home and got to bed around 2am.

<p>The plane is now taxiing slowly through the terminal area.

<p>Last night I did a panic pack, including depositing checks and withdrawing cash, purchasing film and razors at Walgreen's, and finally got all my stuff packed and went to bed at 5am.

<p>Awake at 7am and Manda drove me to the airport and now I'm on the plane and here I am.
