<p>I am the Head Hydrator.  I got the job after taking it upon myself to hand people glasses of water with a simple smile and, "drink this."  I like the job because the youth really appreciate it when I give them water even before they realize how much they want it.  Or before they can work up the energy to get up in this heat and get it for themselves.

<p>We have two big 5 gallon water cooler things, and they get refilled about once per hour.

<p>Before most people came, I walked around the camp to get a sense of the layout and to greet the youth on SWUUSI staff. I rode around in the back of Adam's truck on top of a pile of matresses as Adam and Kris did a bed shuffle to get correct number of beds into the correct cabins.

<p>The youth and other advisors arrived amidst flurries of happy hugs for old friends and welcoming greetings to our new youth. I am (as usual) working carefully to remember or learn all the first and last names of the youth.

<p>The community is delightful and about to eat dinner. I've been wearing my soaking wet PakTowel around and over my head. Despite the heat, the general mood is happy and excited about the upcoming week.

<p class=date>11pm Sunday 26 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>After dinner I watched youth swim, but I didn't swim at first since I hadn't brought my swim trunks to the lake. (it was a 7 minute walk each direction from the camp to the lake)

<p>I went and got my trunks and Jason Fricke and I had fun wrestling and goofing around in the water.  At one point we were standing back to back with our arms interlocked and trying to essentially do flips while staying in this position.  We were able to do it a few times, and that was cool.   <br>Then the funniest thing (funny to me; Jason thought it was funny, but thought my reaction was funnier) was when we were doing a flip and our backs squirted air from between them in a perfect farting sound and I collapsed with laughter into the water.
<br>Jason was all poking fun at me and I couldn't stop laughing. 
<p>That was so hilarious.  We laffed and laffed and had a great time. He jumped off my shoulders a couple of times.

<p>then Jessica got on my shoulders and jumped where it was too shallow and I cringed and then she came up out of the water holding her head. "Ow," she plaintively, and my brain fell apart.
She had landed basically straight exactly head first and crunched her neck. I helped her to shallower water and held her, soothed her, carefully keeping appropriate advisor boundaries. I didn't think to have Wende or someone zip back up to the main camp to get help. Jason made jokes to help cope but had to stop because Jessica couldn't laugh because it hurt her neck.

<p>Finally she was able to stand and get out of the water and she sat with Wende and I zipped back to the main camp and got Arlene (acting as nurse) who drove her car to get Jessica.  Because Jessica could walk, and could move her neck, we simply put ice on it and sent her to bed.

<p>(She was all better by morning.)

<p class=date>am Sunday 26 July 1998</p>
<font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p>After saying HI and bye to Amanda, and being up on my computer
I went to bed at 4am and slept 30 minutes until Wende called. During that sleep I experienced my soul perfectly existing in this continuous moment.  Beautiful.

<p>Wende said she was coming right over and she finally came over so very much later than I wanted and she wanted me to take some boxes to my back porch to be recycled and I ran to do it so as to not be late and holy shit I lost my toe ring.
<br>Sadness sadness anger sadness <em>why my toe ring that I've had for such a short time??</em> Fuck!

<p>Andger at Wende for being late subsided by the time we got to pick up Bix and Cathy from Spring High School at 6:10am.  I slept uncomfortably in the front seat at first on the way up, and then drove from just past Centerville the rest of the way... 29 miles into Oklahoma.

<p>We were not particularly super talkative on the way up, which was surprising to me, but I think it's because it was so durn early.  Wende's truck thermometer showed 107 degrees F.

<p>We stopped at Braum's along the way and I got a glass of water, a glass of orange juice, and a vanilla shake.

<p>So here we are and the camp is quiet as only a few people have arrived.  And it's hot.

                        <p>1998 SWUUSI Review by Maia Cudhea</p>

<hr>

<pre>

i can't believe no one reviewed swuusi.  so i'll do it belatedly.
okay, here's what i remember several months later.

i got to camp really late saturday night, and the rest of staff was way
already there.  my hair was all done up from my sister's wedding (why i
was late) and i was so tired.  so we had this quick meeting and said we'd
do everything else tomorrow and i went to sleep on a table.  this was the
last time i was at a comfy temperature for many moons.  
next thing i know, kris is waking me up babbling something about the
perfect arrangement of cabins he and aaron worked on all night.  i was
all, okay kris.  so i helped everyone move beds from cabin to cabin for a
while, which was hot dirty work.

then people start arriving way before we're ready.  so me and ashley haul
ass to get touch groups done and registration ready while evryone else
works on other camp stuff.  registration is this big blur, but i remember
this awesome buddy-program thing we did for newcomers that worked great
and everyone was having a blast.
we did the opening circle thing and then i went ot bed.  i was soooo
tired.
this crazy bedlam of fun stuff and extreme exhaustion on my part and all
these mini-crisis persisted all week, so it's kind of hazy.  but some
stuff stands out

i remember swimming one night and playing this awesome game of water
volleyball where no one really cared or had teams, we just hit the ball
and laughed and splashed and had mad fun.  and i remember the awesome
food aaron and kris and anne worked out, with decent veggie food,
considering we were in nowhere, OK.  
and i remember the awesome power shuffle workshop taylor (used to be
mandi) led.  everybody cried and it was this big emotional cool as all
hell thing.
and i remember shopping for prizes for the touch group trash hunt with
debbi at wal mart. i swear we walked up and down every freakin aisle and
our feet hurt and our tummies hurt from laughing.  and then we were
stuffing ramen noodles in these little boxes and thought it was so cool.
and i remember the social action thing with east side renasisance that
came off so well, even though i was afraid it was gonna fall apart at the
last second.  and how ya'll all busted your butts in hot weather and most
of you found out you had a good time.
and i remember going to shoney's and finding out the guy we told we were
coming in didn't tell anyone else, but how they were really nice anyways.
 and we had so much fun stinky from working in public.
and i remember probably having the only comfy place to sleep, cause bryn
had this box fan by her bed and never slept, so i sat it on her bed and
had a breeze all night.
and we had an awesome game of silent football with bunches of people,
that did degenerate into chaos so i left.
and remember laughing till i almost peed when kris told me about the game
of capture the flag and the "leah song" and breaking out of jail.
and i remember the awesome theme speaker and super worships and great
adults and cool workshops and neato special events and the killer
community.

thanks for all the great memories guys.  love you.

                        <p><title>lock-in and beach cleanup</title></p>

<p class=date>Saturday 18 July 1998</p>

<p>Last night Wende and I went to the Post GA Participant Party and it was cool.  10 of us were there, and I felt a nice balance between talkative and listenative.

<p>When we left the weather was storming and I came home and turned off my PC in case the power went out.  Then I cruised to the youth lock-in at First Church.

<p>I got there around 10pm and the youth were being fairly rambunctious, but still not too crazy.  We watched <em>Father of the Bride II</em> then they were super wild and rambuncitous, throwing balls in a team keep-away game and wrestling and general running around.

<p>Once they wore themselves out, we organized (with some difficulty) a "fishbowl" .. designed to help the youth bond.

<p><blockquote>(the way we wanted it to work was have everyone write a question that each individual in the group would answer out loud to the group.  They wrote the questions okay, but we could not get everyone to respect those who were talking and to not talk while others were answering the questions.)</blockquote>

<p>By the end it was 4:30 in the morning and I went to sleep for 2 hours before Adam and I left for the beach cleanup at 7pm.

<p><hr align="left" width="25%">

<p>Benjamin, a young adult who I met at GA showed up at the church at 6:45am to join us to the beach.

<p>I woke up Adam and we vacated to group up at Thoreau Congregation to caravan to Galveston Island State Park, where we were to clean up.

<p>Got to Thoreau at 7:31am and got to the Park at 9am and got some garbage bags from the park ranger and we were on our way!

<p>Most of the youth took the full-tilt-go-grab-big-trash-stuff
technique while I and a couple other adults took the walk-slowly-precision-pick-up-stuff technique.

<p>Both techniques worked well.

<p>During the cleanup, I found some well worn pieces of glass bottles that had been broken but were no longer sharp. sand..glass.. makes sense, right?  right.
<br>so anyway, I decided to collect all the broken though smooth pieces of glass I found and make a stained glass window out of them.  I now have a bag essentially full of smooth broken glass.

<p>I collected about 1 trashbag worth of stuff and then took a wade with Wende, Shawn & Amy, and then I took a nap.

<p>Drove home and chilled for like 1 hour and then Wende and I went to see <em>Lethal Weapon 4</em>.

                        <h1>1998 New Orleans rally review by Sean Murray</h1>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>Well it was 3 months ago but I&rsquo;ll try to remember it since obviously
nobody else did. Well. all of the OKC people met at the church at 11:00
on thursday night. It took a while to leave though because we had this
big ordeal because some people from Tulsa and Maia were supposed to come
with us and there wasn&rsquo;t enough room, but I made some calls and 15
minutes before we were supposed to leave Eryn Pope&rsquo;s mom said she&rsquo;d
drive to New Orleans. Everybody send Eryn&rsquo;s mom letters of love and
thanks. so Finally we got on the road. We made several stops (mostly
debbie and I demanding a smoke break) along the way, but at one of the
stops sombody from one of the cars hopped into my spot in the van so I
had to ride in the car with Nacy, Eryn&rsquo;s mom, Frank, and Meriad. Merriad
slept a lot and I was having an interesting conversation with Frank and
Nancy until my nose caught a very fowl oder. After  awhile I realized
the garlic/onion/dead animal/ sent was Frank. Frank, I love ya but put
some deoderant aon those bad boys. So anyways&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
<br>Eryn&rsquo;s mom drove ahead of the van so we arived at Maia&rsquo;s house at about
2 or 3 in morning. Eryn&rsquo;s mom was tired so she took a nap and the rest
of us watched brain candy. 2 hours later I said, &ldquo;hey what&rsquo;s taking the
van so long&rdquo;. 1 hour later the van arived at Maia&rsquo;s house. The van had a
blow out so they had to pull over and change the tire. so we all loaded
into the van as Maia shoved us around and pushed everybody out of a seat
so she could have one seat to her self abd we got on the road. About 15
minutes later we pulled over again, the spare tire the rental company
had given us had dry rot so we had to get a new tire. One problem, in
was 5 in the morning, nothing was open. So we had to wait another 3
hours to get a tire. So finally after breakfast we got back on the road
to just intime to colide with Dallas morning traffic. I slept through it
bu everybody else said it took us about two hours. So we finally left
dallas at 11:00 AM. It took us 12 fucking hours to get from OKC to just
outside Dallas. We got to San Antonio faster than that. Anyways not a
whole lot happened after that. Jeanie farted a lot and Mairead made us
pull over every 15 minutes to take pictures. Well we finally arived in
New Orleans but to our dismay we all left the sweaty smelly van to meat
a far worse oder. My first response was to look at frank but he was
still in the other car so it wasn&rsquo;t him. That&rsquo;s when I identified the
smell. it was death. No other stench could be so revolting(not even
Frank), So we ped back into the van thinking that maybe just that part
of town smelled like death.</p>

<p><p>we were wrong&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p><p>Where ever we went the stnch followed. But we finally arived at the
church and it didn&rsquo;t really bother me so much because I was at the
rally. well 27 hours after having left OKC we arived at the church just
in time for opening circle. During opening circle we palyed the quetion
response game wich was funny but as somebody was reading their&rsquo;s Maia
just blurted out laughing really loud so Nathan(being in charge and
everything) asked her what was so funny) and to my horror she says that
She and Emily were just talking about my dick. This was very
very&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;hmmmmm, I can&rsquo;t think of the word but it wasn&rsquo;t good.
Now let&rsquo;s get of Topic here for a second. For some reson my dick has
been the hot topic in YRUU lately. WHY??? It&rsquo;s not that great it&rsquo;s just
kinda there. I don&rsquo;t see everybody thinks it&rsquo;s so god damn funny. HOw
about everybody just stop it. Why don&rsquo;t you talk about Erick&rsquo;s hole in
his chest or Maia&rsquo;s boobs or something. Just stop talking about my Dick.
Okay, back to the rall. After opening circle we all went to our touch
groups. Well everybody in my touch group smoke so while everybody else
was playing getting to know you games we were outside smoking. Sucks to
be everybody else. The Shannon came over and said that he had to put up
some smoking boundery thing in order to eliminate social smoking. So he
up a bunch of boxes made of string that was supposed to sepperate us.
Then Debbie started rambling about isolation and oppression of the
minorities,but after awhile she forgot her point and it just turned into
30 minutes of babbling. So then there was a problem. All of the smokers
kept tripping over the strings that were supposed to keep us from
socially smoking. So we formed a ku and over threw the boxes of string
by burning them with our lighters. So New Orleans bacame a socially
smoking rally and the fun began. As for the rest of the rally, I slept a
lot. I don&rsquo;t remember a thing after 4 saturday morning to closing
circle. I vaguely remember Ashley Robinson saying something aobut me
putting my feet in her face while I was asleep(sorry). So then we all
went to french quarter and spent what little money we had left and went
home. The ride back home surprisingly was problem free other than Debbie
making frequent wrong turns.</p>

<p><p>Love you all,</p>

<h1>General Assembly</h1>

<p><br><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font></p>

<p class=date>10:03am Saturday 27(?) June 1998</p>

<p>Yesterday I started at a workshop on how to get grants from an private grant giving organization.  They give away millions of dollars each year and I nearly snoozed through the workshop (guess who was up late?) but I got their "how to apply" packet at the end and it was all good.

<p>That was after $6.00 (including tax and tip) breakfast of yogurt and granola with Wende. I'll go to the grocery store this morning so I won't have to pay that much tomorrow.

<p>I read Contact and slept through the 3:45 workshop yesterday on sexuality in the bible.

<p>Oh, at the young adult caucus, we barely got anything done as we started late and talked too much (being good UUs), but we still had fun and it was all good.

<p>At 5pm I went to the Young Adult table and chilled while chalices sold themselves and I chatted with Justice, Jen, Matt and Joey.

<p>We decided to go out to eat, so we gathered up the troops and headed to Empire Brewery, by way of High Falls, a local tourist attraction and saw the huge pitch-back water wheel (musta been 60 feet tall) and could still clearly see part of the walls and masonry of the original building.  Then we walked out over the pedestrian bridge that offers a lovely view of the falls.

<p>We ate at Empire Brewery and at the table were Jen, Allen, Matt, Wende, Ashley, Sabrina, Jen, Amy and I.  I went to the restroom and on the way back saw some guys with yellow and red plastic beanies with chrome propellers on top!  I totally had to have 1 so I said HI and asked for one!

<p>Upon arrival back at the table some of the others were all, "where'd you get that??  I have to have one!"  As a group we ended up with 3 such beanies.

<p>I ate really thin crust pizza--Wende Matt and I shared 2 between us. I put some of Jen's left over lettuce, cream cheese and guacamole on my last slice to save for later.

<p>Then off to The Bridging Ceremony (nothing to do with the bridge overlooking High Falls) which was really powerful for me when two youth (bridging across from high school to young adult program) approached me to be their mentor person.  Ian acquiesced and accepted my beanie in compensation.  I was so moved to be so quickly chosen by Susan, who held firmly my hand while she crossed her arms and I stood carefully and felt her energy.

<p>I said, "whenever you're ready" and we soon walked forward hand in hand (without her arms crossed now) and she lit a candle and spoke her name into the microphone and gave a great hug as we separated.

<p>To the back of the room I went with the other young adults where we held hands while singfully chanting our loving support for the other bridging youth.  The whole ceremony was beautiful.

<p>The ceremony was too long for a four year old boy, so I soon ended up on the floor as a jungle gym for him.  When the ceremony was over, as he was riding around the room on my shoulders, some youth walked up to me, "Hi Jungle Jim!"

<p>I chilled and talked to Anne Marie and said HI to Susan and gave her my address and stuff in case she wanted support from me.
She said she's not ready to join the young adult group yet, but she bridged because she's soon traveling to Nepal where there is no YRUU.

<p>Then off to young adult worship I went and we did a silent guided meditation.  Silent in that no one spoke, guided in that we were walking hand in hand with eyes closed through the young adult room.  Quite an interesting experience, especially to arrive back in the circle in reverse order.

<p>Worship ended and I stayed and talked to Jen and two others for a while and we shared toe flexibilities and silly games and talked and bonded and described our GA days and it was wonderful boding time. 

<p>Soon the others left and it was just me and Jen up till 2:45 am and I sleepily lovingly listened to her stories and we found we both love roller coasters and she loves white water rafting for adrenaline (which I would love if given the chance) and I told her my recent skating accident story.  We held hands and fell asleep laying sideways facing each other on the floor til 3:30am when we woke up and went up to my room for her to saline her eyes before she drove home.  

<p>Actually she drove to the other Jen's house, where she was staying during GA.

<h1>General Assembly</h1>

<p><font size=-1>transcribed from my diary</font>

<p class=date>11:30 AM Thursday 25 June 1998</p>

<p>Just went with Drake, Tera, Wende to the mall and Drake and I bought swim trunks for $10 each.  Met Jo Victoria! How cool to meet her after knowing her name from emails on YRUU-L mailing list!  Met youth Tim Wing and Stephanie something and Mandy Jacobson.

<p>Tim had rainbow colored cloth sections added to the pant legs of his pants, making what we call in Southwest District "Nancy Deardorff Pants"

<p>I walked barefoot to the mall and I'm thankful for Wende carrying my sandals.  Definitely having fun and looking forward to our bags arriving around 3pm.  My bag has my contact stuff and skates.

<p>I brought my skates!

<hr width=15%>

<p>1:30am Friday 26 June 1998

<p>I connected with the young adults mostly today and hung out at their booth and helped color their sign and remet Justice Waidner (from Soutwest District) and David May and Riley McLaughlin (sp) and others.  Very few from SWD.

<p>Worship was cool.  I announced to the group that I quit my job and they clapped and a woman said she did the same thing in January.

<p>Went to the dance and got totally sweaty dancin' all crazy and remet Danita who I met at Fall Conference a few years back..  Saw Gregor Faron from Princeton and met Madeleine, who spells her name just like my aunt.  She was impressed at that.

<p>Got back to the room and wrestled with Wende and showered and am now going to bed.

<p>Good night.

<h1>General Assembly</h1>

<p class=date>24 June 1998</p>

<p>Wende and I were 40 minutes late flying out of Hobby Airport for Detroit. That wasn't so bad; I was in a great mood and not in a tremendous rush to get anywhere..  I was in vacation mode.  Whee!

<p>Got to Detroit at 1:15pm and easily made our connecting flight that was to leave at 1:45.

<p>Yup, we made the flight.  Sat in our seats.  

<p>There we were, waiting to take off..   anytime you're ready, Mr Captain.

<p>Okay..  we're all on the plane with our seat belts fastened.

<p>The flight was cancelled.  They couldn't get the air conditioning to work, and said therefore there would be not only no cool air, but no cabin pressure in the plane.  That would be bad.

<p>No plane was sent to replace the one we were on.. Just <b>"sorry"</b> and we were on our own.  

<p>I'll save you the pain... but we were at the airport for 8 hours.  I bought a Popular Science magazine and read about UFOs and other science stuff.

<p>Around 8pm I sat by a woman who spoke fluent Japanese and very little English.  She showed me the first 11 Japanese numbers from zero to ju, and how to write "thank you" and "Tokyo" (Toukiyou)
and it was quite a grand time.  I got her snail address and probably will write to her.
<br>I can write "thank you" and "tokyo" 11 times and number them!

<p><font size=-1>transcribed out of my diary</font>

<p><pre>11pm We got to Rochester.  finally.
No checked luggage though; it will
be delivered to the hotel in the morning

Talked to Drake Baer and turns out 
he also quit his professional job to pursue
youth advising.  It's great to see Tera and 
meet Joey Lyons.

It's 01:15 or so Thursday 25 June 1998.
Welcome to General Assembly.

<p><p>This Sunday at church was the 8th graders&rsquo; Affirmation Sunday, honoring their place in the church and welcoming them into the high school program.</p>

<p><p>We had a slightly different preparation process this year; the youth paired up with adult mentors who worked with them in various fields of growth, from creating a personal view of God and religion, to doing some service work for the community.</p>

<p><p>The youths&rsquo; speeches were beautiful; I could hear sniffling noses in the audience behind me and my sniffling nose.</p>

<p><p>After the sniffling, we had pizza!  Yay!  Pizza for all and then even better, a trip to the Woods&rsquo; beach house down on the beach.</p>

<p><p>We piled into 3 vehicles and cruised down there, talking, laughing and playing silly mind games with one another.  (&ldquo;Ceiling Wall Floor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Name That Famous Person&rdquo; were the most played)  Oh, we also sang, &ldquo;I know a song that gets on everybody&rsquo;s nerves&rdquo; and &ldquo;This is the song that never ends&rdquo; to pass several minutes..</p>

<p><p>Dang. Now the song is cycling through my brain.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll be right back.</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>19 May 1998</p>

<p><p>Their beach house is pretty cool.  It&rsquo;s dome shaped, and is made up of like 50-some-odd wooden triangles.  There is an upstairs and downstairs and living room and kitchen and 2 bedrooms.</p>

<p><p>We chilled for a bit and after all the youth ran out to go swimming, a wandered out there and began to bury my feet in the sand.</p>

<p><p>Each time I go to the beach, I dig some kind of hole, usually until the water come sloshing over it from the surf, or bubbling up from the bottom.. in either case, flattening the hole into a gentle puddle on the beach.</p>

<p><p>This day I simply stood and dug a hole with each foot, burrowing slowly down into the sand.  After not too long, I had them buried up to my ankles.</p>

<p><p>I chilled for a bit like this, closed my eyes and felt the wind and sun. (I was smart enough to wear long sleeved shirt and pants, some great sunscreen!)</p>

<p><p>This didn&rsquo;t feel deep enough.  So I wrenched my feet out and dug deeper, fully covering my ankle bones and everything.  That was fun for a bit. I tried to jump, which stretched my back in a weird way that made me remember why I didn&rsquo;t like to jump while my feet are buried in sand.</p>

<p><p>How much deeper could I go?  I still had not used my hands to bury my feet, so I let my hands help with the holes this time. While I was digging, a particularly ambitious wave reached my excavation site, beginning the puddle formation.  This just helped me dig deeper so I did.</p>

<p><p>Finally I had my feet buried fully 1 foot deep.</p>

<p><p>I closed my eyes and meditated like a tree. Just experiencing the beach and nature around me. I decided I would not open them until someone came up to me, or until the surf reached me 3 times.</p>

<p><p>I peeked when I heard Wende&rsquo;s voice off in the distance.  Oops. I closed my eyes again, aware that she was approaching.
I didn&rsquo;t expect a gentle kiss on the lips from her.  Mmmm.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;HI&rdquo; we both said.</p>

<p><p>She was as tall as I, or something; she seemed to appreciate the extra foot the sand gave her.  The weird thing for me was that as I scanned the horizon, everything looked fine.  Then as I looked at the ground closer and closer to me&hellip;  Yeowzers! I&rsquo;m suddenly short!</p>

<p><p>I was probably out in that spot for a bit over an hour.</p>

<p><p>The youth had come by twice, and were playing out in the raft when I decided I had been a tree long enough. My feet tingled after I pulled them out of the sand; my hypothesis is the sand smooshed the blood out of them, so they kinda went to sleep.</p>

<p><p>The raft was fun; I helped them pull it out toward the breakers and against the prevailing tide, and once we were a ways out, let the waves whhhhhaaassshhh us back toward shore, sometimes tumbling one or two youth out of the raft.</p>

<p><p>A wonderful fun time was had by all.</p>

<p><p>We were soon called in for dinner, hotdogs, and meat or vegetarian burgers. I had a veggie burger and sat by Anna, giggling with her about rally stories and a joke.</p>

<p><p>I told the joke to the group.. it&rsquo;s my favorite entirely clean joke lately. Maybe I&rsquo;ll put it in here. Probably not.</p>

<p><p>Anna and I enjoyed it more than the rest of the group, and I&rsquo;m glad about that.</p>

<p><p>Pretty much after that we packed it up and went home. On the way back I rode with Wende, who had driven up separately because she had to go to work for a bit.</p>

<p><p>I don&rsquo;t remember what we talked about.</p>

<p><p></p>
