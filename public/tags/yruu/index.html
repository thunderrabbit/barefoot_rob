<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I woke up with a YRUU dream in my mind.</p>

<p class="dream">
We were somewhere and someone sang some made up lyrics
There was a new  attendee from Colorado, and we jokingly said we had
not heard of their football team, the California Nuggets.  As an
apology, someone sang
</p>

<p class="dream">
Oh my darling, oh my darling<br>
Oh my darling, Clementine<br>
We don't know the football team name<br>
but we remember you just fine.<br>
</p>

<p class="dream">
And everyone cheered.  I proposed we do an impromptu talent show with
a continuous stream of such made up lyrics.
</p>

<p><p class="dream">
We went down to the stage, but it was roped off for cleaning. I asked
the person if we could use it, but was denied.  We would have to come
back in 30 minutes.  So we all lined up and started a freestyle dance
while in line when
</p>
my alarm woke me up.</p>

<p>I have just called Doug and scheduled a talk with him at 1:pm
ish.</p>

<p>yammering about japan</p>

<p>there are adults in the district who think it&rsquo;s time for you to move on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;yeah well fuck them&rdquo; I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>

<p>Gail didn&rsquo;t know about dedication to me so maybe it&rsquo;s not a done deal</p>

<p>he&rsquo;s repeating a story about about japan that he already told me.</p>

<p>re directors at plano</p>

<p>liability issues for someone not involved as a regular advisor</p>

<p>so the fact that I&rsquo;ve been an advisor for 6 years means nothing?</p>

<p>they think I am getting my socialization from YRUU.</p>

<p>I told him about my men&rsquo;s group</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m single and 32 and playing with the youth</p>

<p>If you were someone in my congregation, I would tell you to move on.
and I know that&rsquo;s hard to hear.</p>

<p>The potenetial liability issue if someone says something.</p>

<p>I would urge you to think carefully about it.</p>

<p>I can understand that you&rsquo;re angry; I would be pissed.</p>

<p>I explained my quandry; I can either not go to the rally and lie to
my youth about why.  They know my schedule and my priorities.  They
know I wouldn't let anything get in the way.  Except maybe my own
death.  If anyone else dies, fuck them, they'll still be dead after
the rally.</p>

<p>I pointed out that none of the reasons he told me not to go include
that it would be better for the youth if I don't go.  None.  All of
them were based on my safety and covering my ass.</p>

<p>He appreciated that I listened to him and appear to be taking his
advice into consideration.  He also suggested that I talk to other
adults to get input from them.</p>

<p>Over the past three-ish years, i have met many people
and done many things unlike any of my dreams.  through
all of these things, one person has always suported
me, always comforted me, and always brought so much
light to my life.  rob, you&rsquo;ve beAn so incredible.
thank you for being my friend.  when i think of not
seeing you for VERY long times, it&rsquo;s super sad.  it
hasn&rsquo;t hit me yet that tomorrow could be our last hug
for long times.  i know you will keep in touch, but i
will none the less miss you.   smile always, and
remember that silent football only requires two
people.</p>

<p>love always,
Brynny Pooh</p>

                        <p class=date>4:30pm Friday 2 June 2000</p>
Wende and I were late to the meeting spot; (supposed
to meet here at 4pm) I
felt pretty angry and yelled a bit.  That felt
better
and we processed our feelings on the way here.

<p>Ironically, not everyone is here yet, so we are
waiting...  Happy random conversations--Wende is
describing our home purchase to one of the parents.

<p>Ryan is doing some sort of magic card trick for
Christina who just hollered, "oh, that was
smooth!!!"

<p>That's a fun word, 'hollered.'  In some parts of
the country a holler is a small valley-thing.

<p class=date>4:40pm</p> "They're here!!  They're
here!!"

<p>We leave now.  I'm driving first.

<p class=date>6:07 pm</p>- we have driven 52 miles. 
  We're finally driving
regular freeway speed now.  Food has been
distributed
at top volume.  We're eating Pringles now at risk of
not having them for dinner.  This entry written by
Wende.    *It's easier with the keyboard at first
but
I think that with practice, writing could be good as
well.*   *For the record, it's more difficult on a
bumpy road.

<p class=date>6:59pm</p> now we're stopped to pee..
haven't even
gotten halfway to Dallas.. Odd that we brought food
but seem to be stopping more often. Wende just
hooked
me up with 2 Star Crunches and Reese's Pieces.

<p class=date>8:20 pm</p>  - (this is Wende) Rob and
I have been 
cementing our vacation plans...
<br>2001 is Australia.
<br>2002 is Costa Rica.  It's also
our wedding.  Costa Rica has lots of beaches which
is
a goal of mine (Wende) for our honeymoon.  I also
think that it'd be cool to visit something like
Hawaii or
Jamica or the Virgin Islands for a honeymoon --
something less adventuring and more lazy.
<br>At any
rate, in 2003 we can go back to Australia and see
more
of it.  Maybe Irene and Nick could meet us for part
of
it.
<br>2004 is in Europe -- I'd really like to see
Ireland and maybe Scotland and a little bit of
England.  There's so much to 'Europe'...  It
probably
deserves two trips to do it right also.  Maybe we'll
go back in 2005 or 2006.  Our latest idea  is to go
on
a motorcycle trip.  We've decided to rent them at
first to see if we like it.   We'll have our
licenses
and practice by 2003 and do the trip in 2004. 
Somewhere where we can see lots of cool countryside.

We'll have those helmets that have music in them and
two way radios.  Rob's idea is to get a bike with a
sidecar.  Hmmmm...  We'll have to see about that.

<p class=date>8:43 pm</p>- Wende just quizzed me on
names from a
mugbook.  Now you know my secret.  We've traveled
223
miles so far and are kind of close to Dallas.

<p class=date>10:45 pm</p> - We just stopped outside
of Gainsville for
snacks and potty break.  It's 157 miles to OKC. 
Since
we've been saying we're fifteen minutes away, Rob
concluded that we need to travel 157 mph to meet
that
time...  No, Rob, that means that we need to travel
628 mph.  We're trying...  
<br>    -typed by Wende

<p class=date>11:20 pm</p> - We played the alphabet
game.  Here it is:

<br>zinger's clingers

<p class=date>12:13 am Saturday 3 June 2000</p> -
Rob just told a joke about catching pink
elephants (because everyone knows how easy it is to
catch a blue elephant).  It lasted for at least 40
minutes.  Wow.

<p class=date>12:52am</p> We're here!  Had to driue
backwards only
once.  Well, twice.

<p class=date>1:27am</p> Bryn pointed out that we
must play much
Silent Football.  I was all, "that's why I drove the
entire way here; I can stay up the whole rally and
sleep the whole way back."

<p class=date>2:03am</p> Opening circle after lots
of hugs and shit. 
I'm guessing 130 peeps here.

<pFrank, during opening circle announcements: "There
are places in the sanctuary where you
may not go, including the sanctuary!!!"

<p class=date>2:59am</p> (still opening circle
(aimost over)) They
just announced that WISHES will be written and
hopefully fulfiled for each individual.  My wish is
to
have a killa game of Silent Football with hardcore
players.  Also to have a game with Nick Carter as
dictator.  Awwww yeah.

<p class=date>4:29am</p>After opening circle, we
went to touchgroups.  I'm in Bryn's group, and we
the group is still talking. .... We're each
asking questions, and someone asked "What is your
favorite word?"  And I answered with an anecdote
from
KTRU:
<br>Alexis was a linguistics major and she loves all
words with N-K in them..  She was so cute at KTRU
meetings: "I just love the words 'linky' and
'monkey'
.. linky linky linky monkey monkey..."

<p class=date>4:45am</p> Touchgroup meeting is
over.. -One of the best I've attended.  Most groups
are super short, just going over the rules and "any
questions" and bye.  No big substance. This one we
really talked and bonded much more than usual.

<p class=date>5:59am Saturday 3 June 2000</p>Here in
the kitchen now, and Frank challenged Austin to chug
3.78 liters of water (1
gallon)... He intended to do it in one chug, but
didn't make it.... 1/2 gallon so far ... and he just
hurled the water (and a bit of acid)  into the
trashcan.

<p>"How are you, Austin?" I asked.

<p>"Awesome!  ...  It was very cleansing."

<p class=date>6:32am</p> Just played some disc out
in the yard; it's
getting light outside so we're allowed to go out
there
again.  Matt's wish was to play frisbee, so I was
certainly glad to help with that.  We had 6 people
out
playing.. 3 rookies and 1 more experienced thrower
helping each.  Very nice.

<p class=date>8:11am</p>After frisbee, I fell asleep
for a bit in the hall
after/while crowded on the floor talking to Bryn,
Melissa, Laura, Keith, Mark, Amy, Adrienne et.al.

<p>Few minutes later I'm typing while Bryn and the
rest of my
touchgroup cleans up breakfast in the kitchen. 
"You're doing great!" I yell.  Carol says  I'm being
a
lazy-ass.   "But I'm chronicling our adventures!"

<p class=date>8:22am</p> I'm sleepin' now for real.

<p>Zzzzzzzzzz

<p class=date>11:29</p> woke up and talked to wende
who went to bed at
4:00am.

<p class=date>1pm Saturday 3 June 2000</p> Played
keepaway disc out in the rain.
Sam climbed on me a few times trying to keep me from
catching the disc.  Dan fibbed a few times to make
me throw the disc to him.  ("I didn't fib!  I lied
through my teeth!" he boasts)
Tanner made many beautiful sky high catches.  AJ
poached many players and got the disc that way.

<p>I realized I had lost my toering at one point
during play.  DOH!!  I had no idea where I had been
when I lost it.  The grass was short, but the ring
coulda been anywhere in 10,000 square foot area. 
Paul found it on the sidewalk in the middle of our
play area.  Thank you Paul!!

<p>Inside now, we're playing Taboo in front of the
blaring loud stereo
speakers....  Taboo requires that players be able to
hear one another..  Okay, they turned it down.

<p class=date>1:30</p> chilling to Weezer, about to
do social action
(cleanup a schoolground maybe)

<p>Only one bus came so we're loaded up as the first
trip
and will wait at the school until the rest of the
peeps are bussed over.  I'm sitting near the back
with
Marissa who says, "moo moo."

<p>Each time I write, youth respond with varying
comments from "is that a palm pilot?" to "What is
that?"
<br>Matt's all, "hey Rob, play Pacman on it."

<p class=date>1:55pm</p> onsite at the school,
waiting for our instructions, Bryn has inadvertantly
started a chorus of 'Tainted Love' by Soft Cell. 
"That song runs through my head all the time," she
says.

<p>Now they are sorting us.

<p class=date>3:41pm</p> Social action is complete!
<br>Our group dug grass out of the sand
volleyball court. It was about 2/3rds overgrown with
grass.  I spent a significant amount of
time using only my hands to gently dig up the grass
so
as to not hurt its roots.  Oliver thought this to be
quite noble.  My nobility didn't last beyond about a
two square foot area, though, and I grabbed a hoe
and began chopping it up like
every one else.

<p>At some point during our cleanup, Silent Football
was mentioned, and Adrien(sp)
inquired what the heck it was.  So I explained all
the rules to silent
football without benefit of hand gestures to explain
the moves.

<p>She said later that she would probably choose to
watch a couple rounds before playing.

<p>(We just drove by Bryn's school and said "what's
up
school?")

<p>On the way back from the school, I talked to
Laura and her ideas for Youth Council.  I'm super
impressed with all that she has done, even before
her first meeting!


<p class=date>5:00pm or so</p> Played footbag
(hackey sack) for a
while, and amazingly the girl who never talks
actually
did talk (only whispering in the ear of her sister
(I
think)) and I'm quite surprised with my amazed
intrigued response.  

<p class=date>5:35pm</p> Bryn and I just exchanged
letters, each saying how cool the other is and how
much joy and sadness we have around her trip to
Australia.

<p class=date>7:03pm</p> Dinner was lovely and
well-chewed. 
Vegetarian burger and cheese and stuff.  I sat
alone,
just watching peeps munch and talk and stuff.

<p>Chillin' and talkin' to Amy and Adrienne outside
with Steve leading "Strawberry Fields Forever" on
accoustic guitar.  Amy and Adrienne are mostly
talking piercings
and stuff.

<p><font color="#FF0000">Rob is so freakin' cool.  i
mean, dude, you have to be
sUUpa hardcore to have one of these doo-hickies. 
Rob is one phizat hombre.

<p><font color="#00FF00">Hello rob the ninja turtle

<br>sam</font>

<p class=date>9:30</p> A band named <b>DR Pants</b>
is performing free of charge (only asking that they
can sell their CDs for $15 each).  Mostly fun rock. 
But it's just rock and not really my thing.  cool
thing is the lead singer used to be in YRUU.

<p class=date>9:50pm</p> me & Shira planning our
skit for talent show.  The band is still performing,
but we both apparently got bored.

<p>Nathan and Elizabeth were looking for Bryn,
couldn't seem to find her so they asked me, "where's
Bryn?"

<p>"She's in the high school room."  

<p>We already checked in there 3 times and she's not
there.

<p>Hmmph.  I decided to check for myself.  The room
was all dark when I opened the door. 
"bryn?"

<p>"bryn's not here!" came back the frustrated
chorus.

<p>I assured them she was, and they were all, "fine,
turn on the lights!"

<p>Turned on the
light and she was in there on the couch.

<p>"HA!"  I shouted, "you all owe me a dollar!"

<p class=date>10:14pm</p>Back to planning, Shira and
I decided on having a banana 
eating contest so now Austin, Stephanie and I are
lookin' for 'nanners but they're 
too green.


<p>Instead of bananas I suggested Surge.  Austin
said that he couldn't chug Surge, and suggested a
fruit juice or something.  Turns out they don't have 2
liter bottles of surge anyway.. only cans.

<p>The fruit juice was agreed to be too heavily full
of sugar..   We got four 2-liters of Mug Rootbeer. 
:-)

<p class=date>11:09pm</p> back at church and chillin'
as the Dr Pants cleaned up their stuff, Psycho and I
recited some of Jule's killa lines from Pulp Fiction.

<p><em>And you will <b>know</b> that my name is the
<b>Lord</b>, when I lay my vengance upon thee.</em>
pew pew pew pew pop pop bang bang bang!

<p>Peeps are walkin' aound wondering what is up
next.. Funny thing is, that people keep asking me. 
Officially we still have worship and talent show. 
Unofficially, Silent Football.

<p class=date>11:30 pm</p>  As often happens when
Silent Football is advertised as such a cool game,
many people are all, "when are we going to play??"  So
we started a quick game of Silent Football, with only
5 people.  (Tuesday AM as I write this and I don't
remember who all played  Nathan, Adrienne, Sam, ... )

<p>Time for worship announcement was made, so we ended
the game.  Turns out worship wasn't quite ready yet,
so we waited around a bit until we entered the chapel
thing.

<p>The worship was simple.  Everyone received a
candle, and then 1 candle was lit.  The person whose
candle was just lit described something that made them
feel joy.  Then the next person lit their candle from
the previous person's, symbolizing that joy may be
shared.

<p>I slept through part of it; (I hope I didn't
snore!)  I described the joy I receive when my higher
self speaks through me and thereby helps me help
others.

<p>After worship, people assembled in the main room,
bundled in their sleeping utensils for talent show.

<p>I lay down on my sleeping bag through most of the
show, listening to various jokes, musical
performances, until Austin said, "hey Rob, are you
ready?"

<p>The Mug Rootbeer chugging contest resulted in
Austin 'winning' by finishing the 2 liters first,
but then ralphing it into a trashcan, pretty much in
one perfect 2 liter flood.  Nick half finished his
bottle and followed with hurling, but not nearly in
such a pretty stream.

<p>Shira and I didn't hurl, and we didn't finish
more than half of our bottles.  We tried to therefore
say we won, but the audience wasn't buying it.
 
<p>Nick says, "I have never had more fun throwing up."

<p>After it was all done, I generally announced to the
group and audience, "let's not do this again.  It's
right on the edge of anorexia."  Someone corrected me,
"bolemia."  Yeah that.  I believe everyone agreed.

<p class=date>Now it's 3:00am</p> and we're playing
Silent Football with Nick as dictator.  We haven't had
him as dictator in a long time.

<p class=date>4:10am</p> 3.5 penance points for Mr
Dictator (Nick) & Mr Ryan so far..

<p class=date>4:55am</p> Mr Ryan lost.  I was sleepin'
during
discussion of motion of the sacred football, and
instantly aroused when "customary tip of the hat was
announced," beginning the new round.

<p class=date>~5:20am</p> Now a much smaller Silent
Football game with myself as Dictator.

<p>Adrienne: "Master Big-Jim-and-The-Twins Potato.."

<p class=date>6:11 am</p> so so so so funny!!

<p>The game started with 
<br>Elizabeth as "Oreo1"
<br>Bryn as "Oreo2"
<br>Adrienne as "Wonderwoman"
<br>Nathan as "Natedog"
<br>me as Mr Dictator using any name except "Mr
Dictator"

<p>In the name-changing tradition of MDD and Duncan (I
believe), honoring some fun at Youth Council and
ConCon 1999, during the game Bryn became "Miss 
Hairball Farm Mistress,"  Adrienne became
"Wonderwoman" (plus super hero hand gesture), and
Nathan became "She Quote."

<p>(for those of you who have never played Silent
Football, or never heard of Silent Football, I imagine
all of this seems bizarre and meaningless.  Let me
assure you, it is both bizarre and meaningless.  And
oh so much fun!!!)

<p>We laughed to tears. it was the perfect Silent
Football game and I'm so super thankful for the
experience.

<p>I'm so thankful for the time playing with 'old' yac
Oreo Twins, bringing back memories of San Antonio
rally YAC meeting 1998 for hours, with tons of
Oreos, including the otherwise sophisticated pic of me
with 3 Oreos stuck to my forehead.  Combining these
memories with lovely ConCon and Youth Council and
General Assembly fun.... all in culmination to etch
them in my mind ensuring that I will never forget. 
:-)

<p>We basically collapsed in the circle, and all slept
about 30 minutes, using legs and bodies as pillows. 
Melissa protected us from cleanup work until time to
collate the lovely muglibros. 

<p class=date>8:12am</p> closing circle. Yogi Bear,
Beaver Song, and then I did the Walrus Song in honor
of Kris Scott.
 
<p>then millions of hugs... I gave big ones to each
youth who approached me open armed all, "ROB!!!"

<p>Then I was chillifying on the edge of the group
and Bryn came up with eyes full of tears.  Oh my gosh
somehow the little detail that she'll be gone (to
Australia) for a year had left my mind.

<p>"Oh my gosh, sweet Bryn."
 
<p>hugged and hugged and hugged so much love and so
much to say, just no way to possibly say it all.

<p class=date>9:13am</p> just drove past the OKC
Memorial, and it's all finished nicely with trees and
all.

<p>I've cried about it plenty on the last three
times we were at the rally.  Interesting to have seen
the site in varying degrees of demolition and
reconstruction. 
 
<p class=date>9:52am</p> just got mcdonald's and are
on the way home.
 
<p class=date>11:16am</p>  dr pants on cd and they are
pretty good. I'm pretty not comfortable in the bench
seat all cramped up.

<p class=date>12:17pm sunday</p> Ryan is leading a
game of SF. The group is doing pretty well for having
not played before.
 
<p class=date>2:05pm</p> Ryan lost.  I suggested the
Seven Game, but they were all, we don't want to have
to think!


<p>Soon a game of Ceiling Wall Floor erupted and then
I started Good Frog Bad Frog.
 
<p class=date>5:45pm Sunday 4 June 2000</p> Arrived
back at our church in Houston.  I slept most of the
rest of the way home, partially using Christina's
leg as a pilow.  Then I got promoted to front seat and
slept well from there.
 
<p class=date>6:00</p> After dumping the youth and
junk off, I just got gas and turned left over a thin
median on Westheimer.  No youth with me so hey.
 
<p class=date>8:00pm</p> Now we're at La Jaliscience
with Aaron, Maggie, Molly, John, Will, and John's
brother Kevin who is staying with John & Maggie for
most of the summer and will probably attend UH in the
Fall.

<p class=date>9:54pm Sunday 4 June 2000</p>

<p><p>Finally at home and am so excited to have so
easily zipped all my journal entries to Wende&rsquo;s
computer here.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m going to email them to myself at work and
hopefully clean everything up and have it online
tomorrow.  Yay!</p>

<p class=date>10:02pm CST Sunday 16 January 2000</p>
<p class=note>(adapted from my diary)</p></p>

<p><p>Friday 14 January 2000 9pm</p>

<p><p>Houston Rally 2000.  Bang we are here after such a short drive!  We in this case = me, kT, and her sister Allison.  Upon arrival, they bounced out of the car and I sat gently munching my chicken sandwich from Sonic.  This is one of the first rallies in a long time that I also didn&rsquo;t bounce out of the car.  Maybe the first ever.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>5:30am 15 Jan 2000</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m so tired.  Sitting by the bathroom = the only light in advisors&rsquo; area.  So so so so much fun watching Jason and Kris at Play (perfect Play with no ego, no plan - just delightful Play) with a big frisbee ring thing.  Micaela and I sat for over an hour watching them, talking to any other youth who happened to sit by us for a moment.</p>

<p><p>Registration was a bit slow as many of them had to be typed into the computer.  Wende spent like 6 or 8 hours at the computer I&rsquo;m guessing as people trickled in from around the district.</p>

<p><p>Jason and I took off for Walgreen&rsquo;s before we registered and got gum for our talent show.  We talked about stock purchases and stuff.  He has a goal to turn $8000 into $25,000 this year.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>5pm Saturday 15 January 2000 (I am 10888 days old today!)</p>

<p><p>Just talked to Bryn, including my intent to phase out of YRUU in April 2001 and attend school in Santa Monica.  Bryn described how she has noticed my change (phasing out) &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not the same Rob that I first met..&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Interesting is that she intends to attend school maybe in California.  &ldquo;Why are you following me, Rob :-)&rdquo; she asks.</p>

<p><p>Double interesting is that she will probably be in Australia in a year.  What if Jason and I could arrange to visit her next summer??  Crazy fun possibilities!</p>

<p><p>Big interesting conflict with Jason and Kris not wanting to pay / register for the rally but finally each paid and all is good.  Jason (and maybe Kris) is conflicted between 18 year old adult status vs give up some rights to attend rally.</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;m glad he chose to stay; we still get to do our gum talent show thing.  I&rsquo;m thankful for that.</p>

<p><p>YAC meeting has been productive.  We debated a lot on contraband bags.  My idea was to just keep it simple and put them in each car where the youth rode.  YAC is trying to take on too much and solve all possible problems with it.  The whole idea is to help make it easier for the smokers to ditch their cigarettes and not smoke during the weekend.  However, there was some concern about liability and whatever with where to put the bags.</p>

<p><p>Played a stomping game of Ultimate where basically Sean (sp), Patrick and I crushed the other team 10 to 0.  Not entirely fun but okay because the other team was not willing to trade players and spirits stayed happy.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>5:15am 10889 days old Sunday 16 January 2000</p>

<p><p>Big fun sittin&rsquo; out at table with Jason, Kris, Micaela, while we did not attend the worship.  We instead talked smack about rap/hip hop and Kris did his impression of the &ldquo;107.3 106.9 the Blaze&rdquo; audio tagline at the new station in Tyler.</p>

<p><p>Me and Jason talent show was well received and worth the wait (the original idea was before Tulsa rally in June).  We started with a few Chicklets, describing how they could be used to help smokers not smoke.  Added a double bubble, added Rug Rats cartoon gum, added paint by numbers gum, added some Tear Jerker Sour Balls gum, added some bunjee gum, added 6 feet of bubble tape, some band aid gum&hellip; Hugemongous giant wad of gum in the end super saturated with sugar and drooling with saliva, almost choking with monstrosity.  So so so ridiculously funny.  We didn&rsquo;t have a good ending <em>per se</em> but just kinda got up as some other gum seeking youth pounced on the stage to scavenge through the pile of unused gum we dropped.</p>

<p><p>The rest of the talent show was poetry and stuff and Rocky Raccoon sung my Steve but played on guitar by Kris, as Steve broke his arm bicycling.  Also, Nancy did her duck/bar/grapes/nail joke.</p>

<p><p>And to top it off for me, Jason wrote/improvised a song for me.  Something with chorus &ldquo;I want to grow old with you.&rdquo;  So perfect.  So touching.  Thank you, Jason.</p>

<p><p>Then:  Silent Football.  Good game, about 15 players, many of them were new to it.  Nathan lost due to extaneous sloppiness.  Although, I did give him 4 penance points for brining in two players (4 penance points out of 5 to lose didn&rsquo;t give him much room to work with), including Nancy who didn&rsquo;t know the rules.</p>

<p><p>The game was pretty close.  Two other players had 4.5 points when Nathan lost.  Props to Daniel who kept playing hard and dramatically got better during the game.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>10:39pm Sunday 16 January 2000</p>

<p><p>Sean (who played Ultimate with me) greatly thanked me for Silent Football!  He was inspired to bring it back to his church.  Yay!!</p>

<p><p>Closing was nice, lots of peeps out in the parking lot after stuff was cleaned - just talking and hugging and taking pictures.  Closing circle included smashing a wall of shoeboxes as a symbolic &ldquo;breaking down the walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Drove kT and Allison to their home, then I went to Wende&rsquo;s and slept.  Ironically, I locked her gate key in her house so she can&rsquo;t get in to her complex.  We&rsquo;ll try in the morning.</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p class=date>6:31pm Friday 14 January 2000</p></p>

<p><p>Rally this weekend!  And I haven&rsquo;t been in charge at all!  So weird.  I
haven&rsquo;t packed at all!  That&rsquo;s not so weird.</p>

<p><p>I think FINALLY Jason will be at a rally with me so we can do our bubble
gum skit, which I am sure will be more funny to people who are there than
people who don&rsquo;t see it, and probably more funny to Jason and I than anyone
else at all.  Basically, it involves Jason and I chewing as much gum as we
possibly can all at once.  We&rsquo;ll each start with a single sliver of Big
League Chew.</p>

<p><p>Today at work I am still inventorying machines, but mostly playing
around.  I haven&rsquo;t been able to log much time lately.</p>

<p><p>Have not been able to get the durn stinkeen modem to work on Deb&rsquo;s
machine!  We&rsquo;ve tried a couple of different modems, and actually three
different machines.  I can hardly imagine what we&rsquo;re doing &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;.</p>

<p><p>Okay, dassit.  Have a great weekend!!</p>

                        <p class=note>(transcribed from my diary) [except for text in brackets]</p>

<p class=date>29-31 october 1999</p>

<p><p>5:31am Saturday 30 October 1999</p>

<p><p>Oh my god it&rsquo;s 5:21 am.  I&rsquo;m at San Antonio Rally.  After work I
was all &ldquo;Ohshit! I didn&rsquo;t get the van!&rdquo;
[it would be a very unfortunate situation to have 12 youth ready to go to San Antonio and me have to say, &ldquo;um, I forgot to pick up the van from the rental place.&rdquo;]
Called the place and they were still open until 6pm.  It was 4:45.  I
went and got it no problem.  All the arrangements had been made by
Rog, and it was beautifully easy for me.</p>

<p><p>Drove back to work to get my CDs because there&rsquo;s a CD player in the rental van!!!!!</p>

<p><p>Then to KTRU to spin Side 1 of &ldquo;The Bear That Wasn&rsquo;t&rdquo; on Jonathan
and Sabrina&rsquo;s show. I got permission from the music director to spin
one side per week!
[there are eight sides on 4 disks in this story-album] Jonathan and
Sabrina gave me phat props on the air afterward. Nice!</p>

<p>((Feb 2015: if I remember correctly, the record was a 45 rpm disk, but
the turntables didn&rsquo;t support that speed, so to make it sound natural,
I spun the record by hand at the right speed.))</p>

<p><p>Home and packed for the rally, shaved my head, shaved my faced,
fixed spelling of Mondro&rsquo;s name on my dj_shadow.html entry and then
drove to church, picked up youth and drove to San Antonio.</p>

<p><p>[We left around 8:25pm and stopped by the bus station in downtown to
pick up Nathan and Ashley. Left the city around 8:50pm. On the way
there, we stopped once for gas (had used a quarter tank) and munchies.
Mostly just listened to music all the way.]</p>

<p><p>Arrived around 12:30am and play play play (re)learning more names:
Zara, Dara, Joanna, Hillary, Patrick, Travis, JoJo, Sam, Karen, Adam,
Oliver.. [if I left someone out that means I forgot you or I for sure know your name!]</p>

<p><p>I just realize for the second time that I don&rsquo;t need a huge
DSL-enabled unix laptop to be able to write these entries! Any laptop
with floppy would be great!</p>

<p><p>Talking to Austin - funny stuff: a pogo stick with a hugenormous
spring that would let us bounce hundreds of feet into the air..</p>

<p><p>Maia came up, &ldquo;hey Rob, where&rsquo;s the other half of your brain?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;What????&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Fricke.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Aw man.. Jason had to work. Doh.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>3+ am Sunday 31 Oct 1999</p>

<p><p>YAC meeting was great today.  Joined by Mark Westerburg (sp) who
had super insightful comments and suggestions - great fantastic to
have his input.</p>

<p><p>We got a pretty big lot accomplished - my portion is to help with
website - help Zara update it.</p>

<p><p>Highlights of the day [not at YAC meeting] as I remember them:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>Austin and I laffing our asses off practicing our "what's up?" 'skit' thing.  Hardly a skit - a long series of choreographed "gimme five" hand slaps while we kept saying "what's up??" with increasing vigor.  You had to be there.  [We ended up not doing the skit at the talent show because it had no conclusion - nothing really funny about it unless it's spontaneous.]

<p><li>Bryn teaching an American Sign Language workshop.  She taught us stuff like: the letters of the alphabet, man, woman, boy, girl, where, what, why, who, how, my name is ____, how are you?, today, tonight, born, stars, persecute, teach, learn, together, sex, oral sex, lesbian, gay.

<p><li>Talking to Lauren's mom Andrea - and getting big kudos for being ROB that they all love so much.

<p><li>Me and Ashley paired up at worship outside in the freezing cold and having kT come up with her blanket and covered all 3 of us with it.

<p><li>YAC wrote a smoking consequences policy!  Presented it to YRUU and the new bylaws are passed!!!  Yay!! We've been working on this for so long - 3 years I guess.  "No smoking" policy is strong.  It includes 3rd offense = 6 months of no YAC sanctioned events.

<p><li>The funniest thing in the world: 

<p>[pretend you attended Bryn's American Sign Language workshop. Pretend that Ian (tall guy) has walked up with Patrick behind him and Patrick's arms are pointing forward pretending to be Ian's arms. A blanket covers Patrick and Ian's actual arms.]

<p>Austin and I were laughing so hard that our throats were hurting. oh my god this was so funny.  Patrick is signing as Ian translates as if Ian is talking and signing: "lesbian, sex, lesbian, sex, big, lesbian, sex, lesbian, sex" 

<p>[This is just so unfunny compared to the moment.  I told Austin, "this is one of those moments that cannot be captured without a video camera.."]

</ul>

<p><p>Woke up naturally this morning and just found out we gained one hour of sleep!!  yay!!</p>

<p><p><hr></p>

<p><p>11:07pm Monday 1 November 1999</p>

<p><p>On the way home kT and I laughed for 20 minutes at an exit sign for Chew Rd.  She took a picture.</p>

<p><p>Drove pretty super fast 80-90mph and got David to his drop off point on the edge of Houston actually 30 minutes early.  We did not stop until we arrived there.  I&rsquo;m thankful for no cops or tickets!</p>

<p><p>Waited until 12:30pm when his parents should have been there and left him at 12:38. I felt a bit nervous to leave him there, but I knew he would be okay. We also had to get Ashley to the bus station at 1pm.</p>

<p><p>Fast again and got her to the station a few minutes early.  She was all, &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed with your timing.&rdquo;  Me too.</p>

<p><p>Dropped off youth at church and went home to shower before Molly&rsquo;s Halloween party!</p>

                        <p class=date>8:22pm Friday 23 July 1999</p>

<p><p>In 12 hours I leave for 2 weeks in Iowa.  I haven&rsquo;t packed yet.  The first week I&rsquo;ll be an adult-at-large on Youth Council, and the second week I&rsquo;ll be an advisor at Con Con.  Each of these events are youth empowering, youth organized, youth everything, and I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of the wonderfulness.</p>

<p><p>I do not have a laptop yet (haven&rsquo;t had the proper cashflow for one) so I may write a mega entry at the end of it all, but maybe will figure out a way to write while I&rsquo;m there.</p>

<p><p>My pictures were not selected for show in The Big Show at Lawndale Art Center.  I picked them up today and I&rsquo;ll put them on my wall here in my apartment where they are loved and appreciated!</p>

<p><p>I&rsquo;ll be sending 10 slides out to another art show thing in San Antonio; I&rsquo;ll let you know how that goes.</p>

<p><p>So my big overall thought these days is something like, &ldquo;how are you going to pay for Australia?&rdquo;  This question is subtitled &ldquo;are the prices my travel agent quoted still available?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>To this end, I think I am ready to fully kick into gear my Flashnet sales and may look for a job as soon as I get back from Iowa.  Weird thing is that after Flashmania in Dallas, I kicked booty talking up Flashnet and now I&rsquo;m out of town for two weeks so I can&rsquo;t really do it.  I hope and expect my excitement will still be up when I get back.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p>Now i am packed.  It&rsquo;s 11:50pm.  Even went with Wende to Target to get little gifts for our Secret Buddies.  :-)   I got a small trout shaped flashlight (&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a flashlight; it&rsquo;s a fishlight!&rdquo;  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so dark in here!&rdquo; - &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, I have my fish!&rdquo;)  Also grabbed a glostick, and something else but I forgot what.</p>

<p><p>I got a dark green Gilligan hat for myself.  I like it.</p>

<p><p>So there you go. I&rsquo;ll be gone for two weeks and I&rsquo;ll have a super incredible time.  No telling what or how much I&rsquo;ll write when I get back; I know how my track record has been..</p>

<p><p>Have a great two weeks yourself!!</p>

<p><p>With Love
<br>- Rob</p>

<p class=date>26-30 (or so) june 1999</p>
<p class=note>written 7 July 1999</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;How was Utah?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>This is a common question posed by my friends, and I&rsquo;ve not yet written my official definitive answer.</p>

<p><p>For those of you thinking, &ldquo;Utah?&rdquo; here you go:
<br>I attended General Assembly, the largest <a href="https://www.uua.org">Unitarian Universalist</a> convention of the year. This year it was held in Salt Lake City. The week consists of lots of workshops, some worship, and plenary, where we as a democratic group decide what issues to focus our collective resources on.</p>

<p><p>I go there just to meet cool people and hang out.</p>

<p><p>Last year I met Jen at GA.  She&rsquo;s my friend in New Hampshire, who I went to visit and we saw Blue Man Group together, and she came down here and is checking out Rice University and she came to KTRU with me one time.  That Jen.</p>

<p><p>So this year, Jen flew down to say HI to me and Wende, and to say HI to Rice, and to attend GA.  Wende drove us to the airport (Wende went to a family reunion and missed most of GA) and dropped us off.</p>

<p><p>Normally I would have skipped this part, but once we found our gate, I went to go P and when I came back, Jen had volunteered us to give up our seats so we could get $220 each!!  That&rsquo;s totally awesome, but unfortunately the next flight was 5 hours away.  That was cool, though because we would make almost $50 per hour, but I didn&rsquo;t want to miss 5 hours of hanging out with our homies at GA..  hmmm.</p>

<p><p>Turns out that we didn&rsquo;t have to wait.  But we did give up our seats.  We got moved to First Class of our same flight!!</p>

<p><p>First Class was pretty cool.  We got beverages even before the plane took off, in real glass glasses, no less!  Once we were flying, we got steamed wash cloths to pat our faces, or warm our hands, or wipe our noses, or clean our ears.  I patted my face and cleaned my ears.  They were already clean so oh well, but it was fun.</p>

<p><p>Bottomless orange juice is one of my favorite drinks in the world. I had plenty on this day.  Before we got our food, the stewardess carefully and precisely unfolded napkins onto our tray tables.  Breakfast was fresh fruit: strawberries, grapes, peeled kiwi and fresh heated sliced bagel with cream cheese on the side.</p>

<p><p>I had milk and orange juice with my breakfast and soon had to P again.  I normally would skip this part, but interestingly, while I was trying to go out of the restroom, a guy was in the way, and he wasn&rsquo;t responding to stewardesses&rsquo; repeated, &ldquo;sir; you&rsquo;ll need to move; he&rsquo;s trying to open the door.&rdquo; and suddenly, <em>kerthunk</em>, he collapsed in front of the door!</p>

<p><p>I proceeded to read the directions on the soap dispenser, and the toilet diagrams, and the ingredients of the deodorant spray, and the ingredients of the soap, then played with the sink water faucet, then the sink drain, &hellip;  then read the ingredients of the soap and wondered who gets paid to design diagrams to explain how to flush toilets then fortunately the door opened.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;Sorry; he passed out&rdquo; was the only explanation I got.  I didn&rsquo;t really want more than that; I kinda felt bad for the guy, who was now nowhere in sight.  Hmmm.</p>

<p><p>A Stephen King-ish image flew through my head. Jen assured me, however, that he had gone back to his seat (the guy who passed out, not Stephen King).</p>

<p><p>Jen and I played lots of Cosmic Wimp Out, a dice game reminiscent of Yahtzee, but way simplified.</p>

<p><p>So that&rsquo;s it about the flight. First class and a guy passed out.</p>

<p><p>On the first day, after we had checked in and met Mya, our two doors down hotel neighbor, I saw a woman about my age standing in line to register our same hotel.  I was in my bouncy &ldquo;HI&rdquo; mode, so I bounced over and said &ldquo;HI!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>Her name was Lucy, and she had had a pretty cruddy time reaching GA; she arrived by train, though I have not heard much more about the event than that.  We talk talk talked, and interestingly enough, she ended up staying in the same room with Matt, Jen and I.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p><b>The site</b></p>

<p><p>Most of General Assembly events happened in <a href="https://www.saltpalace.com">The Salt Palace</a>, a pretty nice convention center. (Better picture <a href="https://www.tvsa.com/projects/convent/salt/salt.htm">here</a>) Most people stayed in hotels within one block of the Salt Palace.  Salt Lake City has some big blocks, though!  All streets are two way streets and are wide enough so that a horse drawn carriage can turn around within the street.</p>

<p><p>Jen, Matt, Lucy and I all stayed in the Wyndham, in part of a block of rooms reserved for young adults.</p>

<p><p>The youth who attended GA mostly all stayed in the Best Western across from Salt Palace, this was the site of 24 hour talking and chilling and some big games of Silent Football!</p>

<p><p>The Mormon Temple stood majestically nearby. Many of my friends visited it during the week, with varied reports as to how cool it was.</p>

<p><p>The Salt Palace had some huge halls (as could be expected from any big city convention center) that we used.  One room was about 500 x 500 x 100 feet for a total of 25,000,000 cubic feet of air in there (I think that&rsquo;s bigger than Bigg&rsquo;s office!)  We used it as the exhibition hall, where hundreds of tables were set up advertising grass roots campaigns or organizations, selling stuff and stuff and stuff, or just whatever people wanted on a table near lots of UU foot traffic.</p>

<p><p>In this hall the Young Adult group had a table.  We sold chalices, resource books, T-shirts, and just generally advertised ourselves.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p><b>My bowl</b></p>

<p><p>Last year at GA there was a table called &ldquo;Empty Bowls&rdquo; in the exhibition hall.  At this table, basically people donated bowls (usually hand made), other people purchased them, and the money went to help feed the hungry in some manner.  People who purchased the bowls got to eat soup during one lunch.</p>

<p><p>This year I brought a bowl to be donated, but there was no Empty Bowls table!!  It had transformed into Empty Shelves, where people could purchase books that had been donated and the money would help a poor urban school purchase books.  But I had a bowl!</p>

<p><p>I wandered around the tables in the exhibition hall looking for one that might allow me some table space to sell my bowl.</p>

<p><p>This was a painful process for me.  I loved my bowl!  I had hand painted it at The Mad Potter (same pottery studio in several of my recent entries) and it turned out wonderfully well.  I had painted a landscape of trees on the outside, and on the inside, an ocean of fish and a shark and whale and a sunken ship at the bottom.  I painted a manta ray near the bottom, and swimming on the surface, a duck in honor of The Far Side.  (No other aspect of the bowl had anything to do with The Far Side, but I when I painted the duck, I thought of The Far Side.)  On the bottom I painted &ldquo;painted with love by Rob&rdquo; and put the date and my email address.  Okay, I am an Internet junkie.</p>

<p><p>I finally found a table that would sell it for me, and I put a $45 price tag on it.  For four days it didn&rsquo;t sell.  By that time, a few bowls had collected on the Empty Shelves table, so I moved my bowl there.  From the Empty Shelves people, I got a receipt for $25 (the price it cost me to make the bowl).  I just got an email recently:</p>

<pre>
Rob,

Just wanted you to know that the colorful and charming bowl you donated to
the UU General Assembly now resides in Whitefish, Montana!  Its sale added
to a generous donation UUs made for books for a local SLC school.  The
school has a bilingual population and their shelves were quite empty.

I really appreciate your thoughtful donation, and I will enjoy having this
happy momento of a good and meaningful week.
</pre>

<p><p>When I wrote back for confirmation that I could use the email, I got this reply:</p>

<pre>
Sure, it's fine for you to use my message on your homepage.  I enjoyed
reading your story of this great little bowl.  I do feel the love and
caring love you put into it, and want you to know that it was admired right
from the start!

Actually, I found  this whimsical bowl on the second day of GA.  It was on
one of the back tables to the left, and a lady there told me the part of
its story she could recall.  I picked it up and loved it immediately, then
continued around the room looking at books and "stuff", and for a chalice
for our little fellowship.  The following day, the bowl was on another
table, and I picked it up again and went through the same ritual of just
holding it.  Finally, on the following day, when I found it once again on
the Empty Shelves table and it about jumped into my hands, I knew that it
was certainly following me for a reason!   I just admire all the
imagination which went into it, the vivid, happy colors, the shining
quality.  And the duck on top.

I hope that if I get to the Nashville GA next year there will be another
bowl there by Rob--and that there will be an Empty Bowls project, as well.

<p><p>I haven&rsquo;t written back to see if I can use the above email.</p>

<p><p><b>Lucy</b></p>

<p><p>Lucy and I had great fun hanging out together.  We talk talk talk talked, ate breakfast two or three mornings together, went swimming twice, and just generally reconnected from a past life or two.  Twice we stayed up until like 4am talking about anything and everything.</p>

<p><p>We played on a treadmill down in our hotel&rsquo;s weight room; we found that just standing on it would make the tread move downward, allowing a nice feet massage as feet passed over the roll bars!  This was beyond exceptionally hilarious at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning!</p>

<p><p>On a previous evening, a group of young adults were all at a worship or something that ended at 11:20pm.  Our pool closes at midnight and Lucy and I had planned to swim that night.  We calculated: 15 minutes to get to our hotel, 5 minutes to change&hellip; that will give us 20 minutes in the pool!  GO!!</p>

<p><p>So we ran from the Shilo hotel to our hotel, which was 4 big Salt Lake City blocks away (that&rsquo;s like 8 normal city blocks) and changed, ran down to the pool.  And let it here be known that walking quickly for me is the same speed as Lucy running; her legs are shorter.</p>

<p><p>Several people came a tad later to join us; the pool did not close at midnight exactly.  I delighted in cooling off in the pool, boiling in the hot tub, then baking in the sauna, then jumping back in the hot tub, then the pool, then sauna, then pool, then hot tub and back and forth, left right, upside down all crazy fun until a hotel guy came walking through at 12:25am, &ldquo;okay pool closes in two seconds!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>It was more like five minutes before we all left dripping and drying off.  On the same floor was a 20 year high school reunion!  Should we crash it in our bathing suits?  Truly I think we might have if it weren&rsquo;t so late.  I was personally pretty tired, and the general consensus of our group was that we wouldn&rsquo;t appreciate it if our respective 20 year high school reunions were crashed in a similar manner.</p>

<p><p>So instead of crashing the party, we went to our rooms and crashed.</p>

<p><p>Actually, it was a bit more involved than that.  A couple of people were all, &ldquo;meet downstairs in the lobby at 1am&rdquo; and so I changed, went down there and promptly found myself falling asleep on the couch in the hotel lobby.</p>

<p><p>Wow. I was amazed at how astonishingly drained was my energy!  Was it the heat from the sauna and hot tub?  The mixture of jumping between all three extremes?  I don&rsquo;t know, but I was just exhausted.</p>

<p><p>No one made it down by 1:10am, so I left a note and went to bed.</p>

<p><p><pre>
Dearest Water Sprites</p>

<p>I regret to inform you that upon closer examination
of my physical energy level, I will not be able to
attend any After-Pool-Festivities.</p>

<p>I wish you a most delightful evening.</p>

<p><p><b>Bridging Ceremony</b></p>

<p><p>One of the most incredible organizations of which I have ever been a part is YRUU.  Young Religious Unitarian Universalists gave me peace, love, happiness during high school - a place where I was truly loved for being myself.  Where I didn&rsquo;t have to wear certain clothes in order to fit in.  Where I could express my true emotions, be my true self, and be honored for that - unconditional love is a rare thing to find during high school.</p>

<p><p>YRUU started in 1983, I was a youth member from 1985 to 1990, and it still goes strong.  Now I am an adult advisor in this community - I volunteer my time and energy for the youth; they hang out and talk and play and worship and do whatever they do.</p>

<p><p>One of the beautiful things about YRUU is that new freshmen youth are always growing into the group.  Usually a little unsure at first, they are embraced by the older youth and welcomed into the group.  On the other extreme, older youth leave YRUU into the big unknown of Adulthood.  Older youth who know they don&rsquo;t quite fit anymore in YRUU often feel fear of the unknown, sadness to leave their friends, the unknowable, &ldquo;what do I do now?&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>The Bridging Ceremony builds bridges between YRUU and young adults. It welcomes the older youth into the young adult group.  Though mostly symbolic, the ceremony represents an important milestone in a youth&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p><p>I think last year was the first year that General Assembly had a Bridging Ceremony. Young adults were present, and each youth who wanted to bridge paired up with a young adult. One at a time, each pair walked to the front of the room where the youth spoke their name into the microphone, picked up a piece of clay (representing how their future can be molded to any shape), and a copy of <em>UU Backpackers, a faith for the road</em>.</p>

<p><p>Other than the 30 or so youth who bridged and the young adults who escorted them, about 60 people showed up last year.  Absolutely incredibly moving experience.</p>

<p><p>This year, 160 or so youth bridged.  The audience crowded with a couple thousand people.  Beyond absolutely incredible.</p>

<p><p>Jeremy L-N chose me to escort him across stage.  I was absolutely thrilled and flattered.</p>

<p><p>After the ceremony, we all trekked across the street to munch fruit, crackers and various cheeses, punch and stuff.  We munched and talked and had a great time.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p><b>Barefoot</b></p>

<p><p>I am so thankful that I was able to run around barefoot the entire week. None of the hotels complained, and I even walked through the nearby mall for like an hour, including eating lunch and no one said anything (until a security guy saw me as I was leaving, &ldquo;next time you need to wear shoes.&rdquo;).</p>

<p><p>There was an outdoor water fountain begging for me to play in it. Wearing no shoes I happily obliged.</p>

<p><p>The fountain was a single straight row of about 30 spouts, splashing right up out of the sidewalk.  The sidewalk basically sloped down into a trough shape and the fountain nozzles were in this trough, keeping the water contained.</p>

<pre>
           |                     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

       end view                                edge view
</pre>

<p><p>The day was delightfully warm and sunny, so I decided to take a walk through the fountain.  Using one bare foot, I found that I could entirely block the spray from a single nozzle.  Blocking the spray of each successive nozzle with each successive step, I walked the entire length of the fountain and never once got a huge spray in the crotch.  I got my shorts plenty splashed, but nothing compared to what I would have gotten if I had just run through a single nozzle without blocking it. That was so much fun!!</p>

<p><p><b>(Warning - starting now and the next two sections involve blood and stuff.  Go to the Silent Football heading if you don&rsquo;t want to read it.)</b></p>

<p><p>Last year at General Assembly, I cut my foot on the escalator.  I basically misstepped while running up the escalator barefoot and gouged my big toe on one of the little groove things that escalators have.  I did not get stitches, but I had to bandage up my foot for the rest of the week.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p><b>Stitches</b></p>

<p><p>This year at General Assembly, after the beautiful Bridging Ceremony, after the reception, I was running downstairs in one of the hotels.  These were soft carpeted stairs.  These were soft carpeted stairs with a little row of lights at the bottom of each step with a strip of wood above each light.</p>

<h2 id="p-pre"><p><pre></h2>

<pre><code>  |                 
  ]         legend:

        p           p   row of lights
         -------
</code></pre>

<p>Side view of steps
</pre></p>

<p><p>In the above image an arrow &lt;&mdash;- points to where my heel clipped the strip of wood as I ran down, resulting in yanking free a flap of thick skin from my heel.  As soon as it happened I was like, &ldquo;ow; please don&rsquo;t be bleeding.&rdquo;  I looked down and it was bleeding. Unfortunately I was 3 big Salt Lake City blocks from my hotel.  And more festivities were planned for the evening!  Shriek!</p>

<p><p>So I stepped gently out of the hotel, hopping and hoping not to bleed on anything. As I crossed the street, I looked behind me and saw little blood splats each place I put my foot down.  Doh.</p>

<p><p>To my hotel I ran, through the grass as much as possible, and gingerly through my hotel lobby, waited for the elevator, unfortunately leaking onto the floor and then up to my room to wash my foot.</p>

<p><p>I sopped a hand towel with blood (not soaked, but definitely spotted) and applied pressure for about 30 seconds, then I put on socks and shoes and went back out.</p>

<p><p>The same elevator was waiting for me on my floor, so I attempted to clean its carpet with a little spit and elbow grease, but it didn&rsquo;t get all the blood. When we reached the ground floor, I wiped my blood off their marble floor, but some of it had dried.  To the front desk I went and told them I bled on the floor and the guy threw away the towel for me.</p>

<p><p><b>worship</b></p>

<p><p>Now I was late (from running 3 blocks, not from time spent on my injury). I now ran back 3 blocks plus 1 block to the Shilo hotel for worship.  The room was dark, worship had started, so no one commented on my wearing of shoes.</p>

<p><p>The worship was led by Kim(?) - basically she offered some different Tibetan techniques for meditation and invited us to meditate for about 5 minutes.  This meditation time was well received by me.</p>

<p><p><b>dancing</b></p>

<p><p>Each night at GA there was dancing going on at one of the hotels: two different rooms with different themes or genres each night.  After the worship, as people made plans for the evening a few people asked me, &ldquo;hey are you going to the dance?&rdquo;  At first I was like, &ldquo;um, uh, I dunno&hellip;&rdquo;  then, &ldquo;um yeah, I might be there&rdquo;  then, &ldquo;yeah yeah I&rsquo;ll probably be there for a bit&rdquo;  then, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going now!&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So the heel of my sock was entirely soaked in blood, but it wasn&rsquo;t like seeping through my shoes or anything (good thing they are black leather hightops) so I danced.  I mostly danced with Christine.  We hadn&rsquo;t previously met, so we were just random chit chatting while slow dancing.  Oh wait, let me back up a bit.</p>

<p><p>I had on my name tag two little tiny red flashing lights.  These came from a button from Wende&rsquo;s bookstore that Wende gave me some time ago.  I immediately ripped that button apart, removed the lights for a later date.  GA was that date.</p>

<p><p>As Christine and I danced close together, my blinking red lights were right by her breast, apparently to the amusement of some people around us. I heard this later from my friend Tara, and I thought it was pretty funny.  I told Christine about it later and she thought it was funny too.  Wende, who was with me when I told Christine, didn&rsquo;t think it was quite as funny.  (note: Wende objects to the preceding sentence.)</p>

<p><p><b>ultimate</b></p>

<p><p>After dancing for a while, the time came for Ultimate Frisbee.  It was about 12:00 midnight and people were supposed to meet at 12:30 at the Shilo next door.  I went there, found no one but Kim (who did the worship) so she and I went to the park where Ultimate had been played the previous night.  We talked for a while about life and meditation and stuff for 20 minutes until the rest of the group finally showed up.</p>

<p><p>Ultimate was great; my foot felt only slightly throbby and a good time was had by all.  But now blood was in fact leaking out through the mesh in the heel of my shoe.</p>

<p><p><b>the game</b></p>

<p><p>At about 1:30am, I walked to the Best Western, where the youth were playing a cool weird game called The Game.  I had never seen it before, but I assume I&rsquo;ll play it someday soon.</p>

<p><p>Bryn, one of my youth in Southwest District saw my foot, and brought to my attention the fact that I probably ought to at least look at it.  She offered her bathroom for this purpose.</p>

<p><p>(okay, this might be gross)  Against the pristine clean white bathtub, my blood shone brightly like in the movies.  My sock was fully soaked, heel to toes, a lot of it brown and icky.  The blood mostly squeezed right out of my sock; it apparently wasn&rsquo;t cotton.  I flapped open the flap of skin to let the water wash over it, and the electric pain stab through. Bloody watery rivulets flowed down the drain.  Something gross was under the flap of skin. I thought it was fleshy meat at first, but I pulled on it and felt no pain.  I pulled it entirely out and decided it was a blood clot about the size and feel of a pulverized raisin.</p>

<p><p>&ldquo;I need to get stitches.&rdquo;</p>

<p><p>So we went back down to the front desk, where the hotel staff guy was working on something and didn&rsquo;t notice us.  I picked up the courtesy phone on the counter and dialed the front desk.  He answered and I said something like, &ldquo;hello front desk, this is Rob at the front desk.&rdquo;  He turned around and we all had a good laugh.  It was 2:30 in the morning.</p>

<p><p>He called a cab, and Bryn pleaded that I let her go to the ER with me.  So we went and had a delightful time as I got stitched up.  The one not-yet-a-nurse guy Matt was fun; he&rsquo;s working as an intern there while going to school for his bachelor&rsquo;s degree.  Dr Welch was friendly and explained that the skin was so thick that the stitches might not hold, but she would &ldquo;tack it down&rdquo; so the skin could act as a natural band aid.  I lay face down and bit the pillow as she injected lydocain in 4 spots.  The first stitch I could not feel at all.  The remaining three I could feel and I bit the pillow again for each one.  She quickly tied up all the loose ends and I got four layers of bandages, plus an Ace bandage. We called another cab and left.</p>

<p><p>Dropped Bryn off at her hotel amidst lots of youth who had now heard what happened.  I went to my hotel and was pretty much able to walk with no problem. I just stayed off my heel and went to bed.</p>

<p><p>Next morning I woke up and tested stepping on my foot.  The pain was astonishing when I put weight on my heel, but no problem at all when on the ball of my foot.  Blood had soaked through all four layers of bandage and the Ace bandage, so Jen found someone who had a car and went with me to the hospital.  The nurse did not re-admit me (saved hundreds of dollars there, and I&rsquo;m very thankful) but just unwrapped my foot, declared it all good and re-wrapped with new gauze.  Cool.</p>

<p><p>For the rest of the week (and even now some) I just walked on the ball of my foot.  But dangit; I couldn&rsquo;t go swimming for the rest of the week.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p><b>More Stitches</b></p>

<p><p>In the morning before Jen escorted me to the hospital again, she said something like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had stitches.&rdquo;  Ironically, that night, Jen was playing Ultimate and ended up with ten nice blue stitches above her right eye.  Right in the eyebrow area, so they are hardly noticeable.  Was our room cursed?  Neither Matt, Lucy, nor Wende were injured during the week, so we think it was not the room.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p><b>Silent Football</b></p>

<p><p>The same night that Jen was busy getting stitches, I joined a Silent Football game in progress, with Mimi as Madame Dictator. The game was huge compared to a Southwest District game, like 30 or more people, so their rules were a bit more lax than ours. They had one cool rule that we will probably adopt: the assumed names of players changed during the game to fit their character or mannerism or for no particular reason except &ldquo;what is funny?&rdquo;   My name became Mademoiselle Butt Cadet or something like that.  That&rsquo;s funny.</p>

<p><p>The game included Nathan S and Jeremy L-N doing a &ldquo;Shake Your Booty&rdquo; dance-off to see who would get to be named Captain of the Butt Cadets.  Jeremy won by popular applause, but Nathan was later named Rear Admiral, and quickly pointed out that Admiral out ranked Captain, so Nathan therefore was truly the leader of the Butt Cadets.</p>

<p><p>The game is bizarre, and Lucy, who was with me, but didn&rsquo;t know the rules when we started, loved the game by the end, though hadn&rsquo;t quite figured out all of the hand motions for movement of the football.  There was, of course, relatively little football motion.  The game lasted 3 hours I believe.  I love Silent Football.</p>

<p><p><b>Wende</b></p>

<p><p>Wende missed most of General Assembly, as she attended her family&rsquo;s family reunion until Sunday night, when GA had only 1 full day left.  She was well received by everyone but had a tremendous sunburn and spent a lot of Monday morning sleeping.</p>

<p><p>Monday afternoon we joined 30 other young adults at Olive Garden, but had to wait a while for our table as we had made a reservation for 20.  Interestingly, the 10 of us who waited for our table were served first.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p><b>Closing Ceremony</b></p>

<p><p>Because of the delay at Olive Garden, we ended up arriving late for the General Assembly closing.  The closing ceremony was more moving than the Bridging Ceremony. Nick Page (or is it Paige?) led us in songs and chants and hand motions and love that must be experienced to be understood.  The GA choir sang hugely and wonderfully&hellip; wow.</p>

<p><p>At one point, all the youth (3 rows worth in the front of this auditorium) all left and a few minutes later began to pour onstage.  I began the clapping.  For fully 3 or 4 minutes, the entire time it took for the youth to file onstage, the entire assembly of thousands gave them a standing ovation.  Talk about honoring the youth.  Having arrived late, we were in the back row.  I stood on my chair for this ovation.</p>

<p><p>When the whole ceremony was over, energy was so high that we just floated out.  Incredible.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p><b>Lagoon</b></p>

<p><p>Wende did not just fly to Salt Lake City to sleep off her sunburn, eat Olive Garden, and float out of the closing ceremony.  She came to join Jen and I at Lagoon Park the day after GA.</p>

<p><p>Lagoon deserves nearly its own entry, but suffice to say it had 4 pretty cool coasters (rate 2.5 on my scale of 5).</p>

<p><p>One was a small smooth steel coaster called Collosus the Fire Dragon.  A tad bigger than Viper at Astroworld, it has 2 loops and 2 good low level swoops great for pictures.</p>

<p><p>Another was Wild Mouse, with small cars and 180 degree turns; lots of fun.</p>

<p><p>Jet Star II has the same track type as Whizzer at Six Flags Great America in Chicago, but is way more compact and has tighter more neck-crunching turns.</p>

<p><p>Last is a wooden roller coaster called Roller Coaster.  It has basically two circuits and a few big humps and lots of small humps. Nice.</p>

<p><p>They had a ferris wheel type ride, on which each car could spin freely on its own axis.  Jen and I rode that and began by spinning the car 20 times in a row, turning it upside down and locking the brake, and having a generally dizzy fun time.  Her stitches didn&rsquo;t enjoy it quite as much, unfortunately, so she slept for about an hour at the first aid station while Wende and I rode other stuff.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p><b>The Lake</b></p>

<p><p>After Lagoon, we drove to the Lake.  That&rsquo;s the Great Salt Lake, of course.  Wende really wanted to see it, and I kinda did but was kinda bummed cause I still couldn&rsquo;t swim. Once we got there, I didn&rsquo;t feel so bad.  It looked like an ocean with essentially no waves.</p>

<p><p><hr align="left" width="20%"></p>

<p><p><b>Flight Home</b></p>

<p><p>Wende had flown in from Austin, while Jen and I came from Houston, so our return flights were different.  Jen and I didn&rsquo;t get first class seats, but got a lot of sleep on the way home.</p>

<p><p>So there it is; in summary General Assembly was great great great.</p>
