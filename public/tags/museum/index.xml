      <description>12:46 Saturday 19 August 2017 JST Allow more time when going to the glass museum in Azumino. Or maybe just go early. We went around 10:45 and there was a queue for blowing glass until 1pm.
I did get to talk to a couple of guys down in the glass blowing room. Was soooo happy that they did not turn me away for being barefoot. I could easily imagine a rule, but apparently there was not.</description>

Okay, this guy&amp;rsquo;s house is a bit like a museum.
He said he&amp;rsquo;s 82 years old, and has been collecting this all his adult life.
                 
It&amp;rsquo;s all just in his house. I want to get a Japanese-speaking historian to interview this guy and something something something I don&amp;rsquo;t know what.</description>
