      <description>21:13 Sunday 22 October 2017 JST I glued the first curved piece which will turn the largest marbles nearly 180 degrees.. perhaps 170.. I am not yet sure if the track will work, which kinda spooks me. In Marble Track 3, if the characters glue everything before I glue it, I won&amp;rsquo;t easily be able to test a portion of track that seems like it needs testing. aka once I glue it without testing, it will take double extra time to refilm them putting the piece in place.</description>
