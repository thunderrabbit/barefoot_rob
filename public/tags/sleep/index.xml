      <description>16:45 Friday 30 August 2019 JST Several different things on my day off today. Mostly related to work, where I realized the value of having a staging server with non-live data. &amp;ldquo;Ohhh that is right; I tested saving data as well..&amp;rdquo; when AB was like, &amp;ldquo;Um, where is the Azabujuban record?&amp;rdquo; which had been renamed to &amp;ldquo;Doraemon 5e5433a38e2b035689a75c9ed11ffb0e&amp;rdquo;
Once I fixed all of those (about 8 different records) based on the old live DB which is still available at cli with mysql as root, I watched episode 3 of The Naked Director.</description>

      <description>16:40 Saturday 30 December 2017 -02 We are going to get on the flight in several hours from now. I wonder when I will start to reverse my sleep schedule. We are 11 hours behind Tokyo, so not as far away as possible, but close.
I have just gotten out my computer (to work on ConSwi) when I realized I should be sleeping.</description>

      <description>07:27 Wednesday 11 October 2017 JST I just had a nap on the train while headed to Kawasaki. I&amp;rsquo;m barefoot on the train, with my computer in my lap. I will put on my shoes once I reach the building where the lesson is.</description>
