      <description>09:18 Thursday 02 April 2015 JST I saw a car with a Google branding and a multi-windowed ball on top. Ah! The Google Mapmobile! I was on Lin&amp;rsquo;s bicycle so I zoomed along beside/behind the car as much as possible, then stopping at lights as it got stopped. I didn&amp;rsquo;t stare at it like crazy but I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll be in a fair few frames along the street we were on together.</description>

Longbets currently features 600+ predictions about the future. The site encourages people to develop long-term thinking to offset the instant gratification encouraged by consumerism.
I came across this prediction: &amp;ldquo;By 2030, the apostrophe will have functionally disappeared from American English.&amp;rdquo;. To that I say &amp;ldquo;ha!&amp;rdquo;
I began to compose a dorky reply,
A post positing a post apostrophe society positively promotes the most promising deposit possible  but am not satisfied enough to post it on that site.</description>

Back when Minefold was in business, I paid them to host a private world for me. They went out of business and I downloaded the world, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it working on my local machine until recently.
Since then, I built a relatively long minecart track in the nether put a large portal at the end of it. Delightfully, the overworld portal happened to be quite close to a desert.</description>
