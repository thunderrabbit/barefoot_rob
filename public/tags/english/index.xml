      <description>18:34 Wednesday 17 January 2018 JST First three classes were fine today, though I have been asked to blow through a book super fast to let one class catch up with another class. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s how it works.
In other news, JB has a new owner, who seems nice enough that I can keep working here. Really curious as to how much they paid!</description>

      <description>22:43 Monday 11 May 2015 JST Today in Japanese class we talked about family, and words for family members. I learned つま instead of おくさん for Lin, or even 内の上 （うちのかみ）
I wrote a nice letter to Lin based loosely on the format Ayako gave us.
Spoke to Stefan after class; he and Yukiko were married yesterday, and her birthday is tomorrow! I&amp;rsquo;m getting over my crush on her; good timing.</description>
