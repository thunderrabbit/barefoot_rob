      <description>20:21 Thursday 26 November 2015 JST This is a note to Mayumi after she was asking me about computer lifespans, etc.
there are probably errors in the tripe below. Hard drives are rated with various numbers (e.g. speed, size, dimensions) and others, including MTBF (mean time between failures). I think the average hard drive we might buy in the shop has 10,000 hours or 15,000 hours MTBF, which I believe means this model of hard drive can, on average, be used for 10,000 to 15,000 hours before it fails to do its job (store and retrieve data).</description>
