      <description>22:36 Sunday 26 March 2017 JST Great fun with Lin and Mikako yesterday, meeting and eating pizza in Jiyugaoka at Napolis. Cheesy four-cheese pizza for me and different pizzas for them, then (by way of a jewelry store) to Jonathan&amp;rsquo;s where we had dessert. I had probably too much dessert, but it was yummy even so. Got pictures with Francois.</description>
