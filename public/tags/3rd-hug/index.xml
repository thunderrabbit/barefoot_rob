      <description>11:51 Thursday 28 May 2015 JST I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this is the third year I&amp;rsquo;ve hugged Amma, or she hugged me, I guess. Last year I received a mantra from her, and I confirmed I remembered it (almost) correctly. I had one vowel slightly off (and all the other things that are lost in the translation from Sanskrit to English).
I&amp;rsquo;ve got a ticket labeled J-2, along with probably 50 other people, though I don&amp;rsquo;t honestly know how many tickets there are per letter-number combination.</description>
