      <description>##23:12 Thursday 22 November 2012
Lin asked me tonight if I planned to buy the gift she wanted for Christmas.

Don&amp;rsquo;t tell Lin, but I ordered it two days ago. I didn&amp;rsquo;t tell her tonight because that&amp;rsquo;s not much of a Christmas surprise if I tell her now! It was a bit difficult not to tell her, but I was able to convince her that I planned not to buy it with responses like, &amp;ldquo;what are ya gonna do with it anyway, but just put it on the shelf?</description>
