(transcribed from my diary)
Today I felt pretty unproductive. I wrote the following in my diary during Project Heart:  I&#39;m having a crappy day because I didn&#39;t go outside even one single time and just sat in front of the computer and did some email and scanned Houston Rally pictures but didn&#39;t really get important stuff done. I did my budget a bit and updated MR Labs website a bit but it doesn&#39;t work.</description>

      <description>31 January 1999
Today Manda and I found a really cool thing at the post office.
For a long time, they&amp;rsquo;ve had a stamp vending machine that takes bills (20s, 10s, 5s, 1s) and coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies, and susan b anthony dollars). Some weeks ago, I found that I could purchase stamps with only pennies, a great way to spend them, and keep from having to roll them!</description>
