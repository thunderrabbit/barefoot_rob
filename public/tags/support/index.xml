  Those are redacted instructions that showed AWS support that something seemed amiss with the elastic load balancer.
M helped me activate tcpdump and we captured output while recreating the error in different capacities.</description>

      <description>12:36 Friday 02 June 2017 JST wow. I just got (what feels like) a huge bonus from AWS. I broke CBs website and had to ask AWS to help resolve it. But to ask them, I had to pay for support. But it&amp;rsquo;s CBs account, so they charged him to support my error. And due to the way support is billed, AWS bills the next month in advance, so AWS billed CB twice.</description>
