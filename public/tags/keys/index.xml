      <description>21:26 Sunday 09 June 2019 JST Headed to the station I realized I had left my wallet etc at the workshop location.
Great timing to find them before they got across the street and out of site. Rin let me back in and discovered some of the lights were still on so she got a chance to turn them off. Perfect synchronicity again.</description>
