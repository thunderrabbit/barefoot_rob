      <description>Our old router suddenly stopped routing, but fortunately I had not given away the new router that was left when people moved out from an apartment Lin was asked to clean out.
The new router worked, but after getting it going, the printer password would not work and I ended up having to reset the printer network which lost the ssh settings for scanning to b.robnugen.com and now I cannot get them set up again for lack of the server key which I think I remember where I got it from before but it ain&amp;rsquo;t working now.</description>

      <description>01:10 Monday 18 March 2019 PDT I felt sad to have to check out for a significant portion of the NWTA this past weekend. So annoying, and certainly not what I had in mind for my trip!
Was great to meet awesome men. I stayed with Steve R in Vancouver the night before the weekend, and am now staying with Dave M in Victoria the night after the weekend. Headed to Houston tomorrow via Calgary.</description>
