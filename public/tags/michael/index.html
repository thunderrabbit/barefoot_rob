<p>At Mark&rsquo;s suggestion, Michael and I ate at a restaurant in Noborito
where we talked about
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/">Marble Track 3</a>.  I showed him the
<a href="https://www.marbletrack3.com/episode/">secret backend of Marble Track 3 where I have &ldquo;episodes&rdquo; showing the 300+ hours of
livestreams</a> for creating the animation of the construction..</p>

<p>昨日ピンクカウ美佳さんと佳依さんと会って楽しみました。　Had a good time
chilling with Kai and Mika at The Pink Cow last night.</p>

<p>マイケルさんも会った。彼が世界の1番よくなバーテンダーでしたって。We
also met Michael. He said he&rsquo;s the worlds best bartender.</p>

<p>そうでもそうでもないわからないけど、彼と面白い話できた。I don&rsquo;t know
if that&rsquo;s true, but we had a good time talking to him.</p>

<p>美佳さんと佳依さんと日本語でも英語でも喋りました。I spoke in Japanese
and English with Kai and Mika.</p>

<p>戸からピンポン音はピッザヂリベリかたが来た。みんながびっくりした。笑
Everyone was surprised when we heard a knock at the door; it was a
pizza delivery guy. haha</p>

<p>佳依さんと同じ電車で帰りましたけど彼女が先に降りました。Kai and I took the same train home, but she got off first.</p>

<p>Okay it&rsquo;s been a couple days, but we had a lovely weekend in Shimoda.
So glad that Lin joined us!  She said she had a great time.  The
weekend schedule was kinda freestyle, which caused a bit of
consternation for some, but did not affect things too badly.  I
enjoyed getting to know everyone a bit better.</p>

<p>Yoga on Saturday morning was originally led by Lisa, but turned into
acro yoga with people being angels, superman, partners, flippers,
etc.</p>

<p>lkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk</p>

weekend.  Rohini and I are in it!</p>

<p>First time to hang out with Michael one on one.  We ate at a cafe in
the station and then went barefoot out on a balcony where we talked to
a mom waiting for her kid to come back from school.  Michael chatted
with her a bit, introducing us.. I was kinda amazed because even
though my Japanese is better, I&rsquo;m not as willing to break the ice with
people.</p>

<p>We went barefoot out to the river and came across some peeps playing
soccer so we joined them for a bit.  Had some good fun and ended up
with business cards to their restaurant in the area.</p>

<p>Helped a guy by the river who had gotten a fishhook caught in his
shoe.  We were not able to get it out (even though I could not find a
reverse hook on it; maybe it was much higher on the hook), but we cut
the fishing line to which it was attached.</p>

<p>Then played Follow The Leader for a bit, and Michael surprised me by
walking on a rail adjacent to the river.  Nice!  We will play again
sometime.</p>

<p>Talked about internet and stuff until after dark and then headed back
to the station.  His shoes were gone from where he had put them.  We
found a security guard who led us to them down in their office.</p>
