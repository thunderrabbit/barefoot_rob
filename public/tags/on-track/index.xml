      <description>23:28 Friday 27 January 2017 JST Yeah so today was pretty great. Started with an online meeting with two men from Mankind Project in the US. They answered some questions I had about getting some funding to bring leaders here. After that meeting, they suggested I join another online meeting with men who help support men&amp;rsquo;s circles. 25+ men on the call; great connection and I got some great resources, including support for doing Open Circles, so we can advertise to the public and let new men see what it&amp;rsquo;s all about.</description>
