      <description>11:42 Tuesday 11 October 2016 JST I have a headache, which I think is due to too much computering.
How interesting that today&amp;rsquo;s lesson topic was compulsory vacation days.
19:24 Tuesday 11 October 2016 JST Headache is better after going home for a nice nap and a little pink tablet Lin gave me in case of headache. Also just walked to Olympic to buy two liters of orange juice.</description>
