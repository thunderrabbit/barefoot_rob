<p>I put a question mark on the title because I cannot really prove the
visions are related to past lives, but this is a fun way to guide
people through a process to see what could be their past lives.</p>

<pre><code>Each participant gets into a relaxed position, usually either
sitting in a chair, or laying down, or otherwise sitting against
something comfortable.

Spend a few minutes leading the participants through a relaxation
process, whereby they let their bodies relax and keep their minds
awake.  Once they are in this mind awake / body asleep mode,
invite them to imagine getting up and leaving the room.  Guide
them to imagine traveling far away, whether by vehicle, or through
a cave, or through a forest, or by any other means which takes
them from the familiar, to the unfamiliar, and guide them to
arrive somewhere new, yet familiar.

Give the participants a chance to explore the familiar area,
including seeing other inhabitants of the area and moving around
and communicating with them.

Once they have explored the area, lead the participants gently
back the way they came, allowing them to have a clear memory of
what happened and what they heard and saw. (say things like
&quot;coming back slowly, you clearly remember what you experienced,&quot;
etc) Once their awareness focuses back on their physical bodies,
give them a chance to write down what they experienced.  Do not
speak until everyone is pretty much done writing.

The whole process is a state of light hypnosis, and everyone will
still have full control and awareness of where their physical body
is.  They will be able to come back in a moment's notice if they
choose.

Each process will take about 20 or 30 minutes.

                        <p>Growing up, we are taught various things in order to guide us toward
being a fully functioning adult.  Some of the messages we got as
children do not serve us as adults (and some didn&rsquo;t serve us a
children!) so affirmations are an easy way to help retrain our brain
to have positive messages rolling through.</p>

<p>I had heard of affirmations many times before, but my
<a href="https://feelonenesslove.com">coaching sessions with Rin</a> really
helped me see the value of affirmations.  Rin helped me uncover some
of the messages that were unconsciously reverberating in my mind, and
helped me write messages that would serve me instead of keep me
stagnant.</p>

<p>Some of them were basic, and would probably serve most people.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;I love myself&quot;
&quot;I accept myself&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Some others were more specific to me and my situation.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;I smile freely&quot;
&quot;I love expressing myself&quot;
&quot;People are interested in what I have to say&quot;
&quot;It’s safe to express who I am&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Some came from intuition and memory.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;My heart is connected to my abundance&quot;
&quot;I have plenty of work I love&quot;
&quot;I trust the world&quot;
&quot;I trust my guidance&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I have affirmations listed in my daily R.O.B.O.T. pages, and just
recently moved one to the top:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;I smile freely&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>and added a ringer</p>

<pre><code>&quot;God dwells in me as me.&quot;

<p>The Law of Attraction is real, but maybe not in the way you&rsquo;ve heard
portrayed.  &ldquo;Think of something and it comes to you&rdquo; brings to mind
people thinking of a new fancy car, but still not see it in their
driveway so assume LoA is a LoAd of Hooey.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s go to a more subtle level.  In the same way that
<a href="/blog/2019/07/08/my-focus-matters/">my focus matters</a>, I tend to
bring experiences to myself based on my intention or attention.
Focusing on the good parts of my day allows me to see more good parts
to my day, and keeps me in a happier state of mind.</p>

                        <p>Have you ever found yourself flying like a bird, only to later realize
it was a dream?</p>

<p>Have you been chased by &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; or haunted by scary situations in
your dreams?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucid dreaming&rdquo; is a state of dreaming while being aware that you are
dreaming.  Lucid dreaming allows me to have more fun flying dreams and
fewer scary dreams.  This is how I got started:</p>

<p>There are a few techniques I have used at different times of my life.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start a dream journal.  Prepare a notebook and pen, and leave it
next to you when you go to sleep.  Immediately upon waking, write
down <em>anything</em> that you can recall.  A sketch, a sentence, even a
single drawn line or single word can help.  This process of writing
or drawing helps connect your waking conscious mind with your
dreaming mind.</li>
</ol>

<p>Do this consistently over some weeks or months and you will soon
   have more to write than you possibly have time for upon waking.</p>

<ol>
<li>Check to see if you are dreaming.  There are several different ways
to do so.  Do one or more of these tests throughout the day, like
every hour or so.  Eventually you will do a test while dreaming
and find yourself lucid dreaming!</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Test 1</em>: Read this sentence.  Read it again.  Close your eyes for a
   few seconds.  Open your eyes and read it again.  Did it change?
   No?  Then you are probably not dreaming.</p>

<p>Did the sentence change?  Then you are dreaming.  Congratulations!</p>

<p><em>Test two</em>: Stand up.  Look up toward a point way up above you and
   jump to it.  Did you come back down?  Then you are probably not
   dreaming.</p>

<p>Did you stay in the air or fly to that point?  You are
   dreaming!</p>

<p><em>Test three</em>: Count your fingers.  Count them again.  Do you have the
   normal number?  Can you do it easily?  You are probably not
   dreaming.</p>

<p>Do you have extra fingers than normal?  Fewer fingers than normal?
   Congratulations, you are dreaming!  (Or you may have just had an
   accident.  Call emergency services!)</p>

<p>One other technique I have read is to fall asleep with the intention
of being aware in your dreams.  I personally have not had success with
this technique, but it may work for you.</p>

<p>Do you keep a dream journal?  Do you have any other techniques to
share?  Email me at rob <strong>α𝐭</strong> robnugen.com to let me know!</p>

                        <p>In two weeks I will be leading an Eye Gazing Workshop near Shibuya
station.</p>

<p>To help plan my first workshop, Rin asked me to choose something that
made me really excited.</p>

<p>I told her I would have to think about it, and a couple days later it
suddenly came to me as the perfect workshop.</p>

<p>After determining what I wanted the final outcome to be, the workshop
plan went through a few iterations, with support from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/babay0ga/">Georgie</a>, Mark Wild,
<a href="https://www.yourspeakingjourney.com/">Soness</a>, <a href="https://www.shamanism-asia.com/">Kevin Turner</a>, and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://concreteplayground.com/sydney/event/eye-gazing-2">Georgie has been doing eye gazing workshops for years in Australia.</a></p>

<pre><code>They say our eyes are the window to the soul.  This workshop will give
us a chance to look more deeply into ourselves and more deeply into
those around us.

The process is simple, and the results can be profound.  You may
discover parts about yourself that you didn't know where there.

In this workshop, we will be looking into the eyes of people that we
may never have met before.  We will have a chance to sit with multiple
participants, with a small break in between each person.

It's important to have an intention before each eye gazing practice,
so be sure to have some possible intentions in mind.  Some examples
might be

“I intend to get to know myself better”
“I intend to connect with my intuition”
“I intend to practice acceptance of others”
“I intend to practice acceptance of myself”

Let’s enjoy learning about ourselves and each other.

<p>If I&rsquo;m in a bad mood I tend to see things that are likewise bad.  If I&rsquo;m

that I know of this is simply say (or otherwise recognize) &ldquo;this too
shall pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m being squished on the train and can&rsquo;t breathe very well, I
think &ldquo;wow this is my chance to have this experience!  It won&rsquo;t last
forever, and it won&rsquo;t happen exactly like this ever again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If my bare toes get scuffed or squished or bleed due to stubbing a
concrete curb, I think goodness I get to go around barefoot most the
time.  Most curious of all(*), I thank goodness for the chance to wear
shoes so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about my feet being injured.</p>

<p>(* As a positive preventative measure, I thank goodness that my feet
rarely get injured and therefore I go barefoot most of the time
anyway.)</p>

<p>In short, I can choose how I focus on something no matter what the
situation.  If, hypothetically, I were to be yelled at by an
immigration officer for overstaying my visa, I would again focus on
the temporal nature of the moment, and bless the man for doing his
job in the best way he knows how.</p>

<p>Choosing to focus on the positive aspects of things allows me to
experience more of the positive aspects, and therefore have more
positive experience overall.</p>
