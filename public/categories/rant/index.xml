      <description>So long as I do stuff within a normalized range, no one really cares what I do.
I can spend all day trying to figure out one bug, or ignore it. No one will know the difference. I could even quit my job, and just a few people will notice. (some people very much so, but 99+% will not)
Re-reading the above sounds like I am suicidal, but I am not.</description>
