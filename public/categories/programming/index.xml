      <description>Recently, I have had a big server upgrade that has been challenging me on how to finish it. Yesterday I asked a friend of mine if he could look over my plan for the upgrade.
He agreed, and I began to write the email that articulated my plan.
Just in writing out the email I recalled the value of rubber ducking.
The idea is that you explain the problem to a rubber duck, giving enough information so that the rubber duck can understand.</description>

      <description>As a programmer, I often want things to be just right, finding that balance between maintainability, extensibility, and plain ol&amp;rsquo; get-&amp;lsquo;er-done. Today, banging my head against unexpected walls while trying to spin up a virtual machine with Vagrant, I had to keep my focus on the goal at hand: Keep the website up while migrating from PHP 5.7 on Ubuntu 14 to PHP 7.2 on Ubuntu 18.
In this case, the task seemed simple.</description>
