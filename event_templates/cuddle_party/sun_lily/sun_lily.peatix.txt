=== What is a Cuddle Party? ===

A Cuddle Party is a non-sexual social event where participants practice communication and optionally explore platonic touch. Attendees practice setting clear boundaries, communicating their desires, and respecting each others' limits in a safe space.

Cuddle Parties provide an opportunity for nurturing, platonic touch and intimacy, which supports well-being and balanced emotions.

While sensual or sexual activity is prohibited at Cuddle Parties, some light touching like hugs, caresses, and snuggling is allowed between consenting attendees.

At a Cuddle Party, physical contact is optional. The primary goals of a Cuddle Party are to practice exploring consent and communication with others.

=== What do we do at a Cuddle Party? ===

We do two main things at Cuddle Parties:

1. Practice consent.
  A key part of Cuddle Parties is learning how to communicate your desires and how to respect others' requests.
2. Consensual platonic touch.
  Optionally experience and appreciate caring touch from other like-minded people.

We’ll start with an opening circle to get us settled. We’ll then go through the rules of Cuddle Party in a mini communication workshop, allowing participants to practice inner awareness and clear expression of boundaries.

After the communication workshop, there will be time to practice these new skills and optionally explore physical touch and boundaries in a safe, non-sexual way.

We'll finish with a closing circle to reflect on our experience.

=== Why? ===

Clear communication allows more harmonious relationships, regardless of the context.

Nurturing and consensual touch supports a healthy life, strong nervous system, and balanced emotions.

=== About me, “Barefoot” Rob Nugen ===

I have a passion for connecting with the world around me, especially walking barefoot. This helps me to stay grounded, and appreciate the beauty of the present moment. I’m leading Cuddle Party events to help welcome us back into connection after an isolating pandemic.

I have been running a men’s peer counseling group in Tokyo since 2015, and conducting in-person workshops in both Tokyo and Kanagawa since 2018.
