=== What is a Cuddle Party? ===
　
A Cuddle Party is a non-sexual social event where participants practice communication and optionally explore platonic touch. Attendees practice setting clear boundaries, communicating their desires, and respecting each others' limits in a safe space.
　
Cuddle Parties provide an opportunity for nurturing, platonic touch and intimacy, which supports well-being and balanced emotions.
　
While sexual activity is prohibited at Cuddle Parties, some light touching like hugs, caresses, and snuggling is allowed between consenting attendees.
　
At a Cuddle Party, physical contact is optional. The primary goals of a Cuddle Party are to practice exploring consent and communication with others.
　
=== What do we do at a Cuddle Party? ===
　
We do two main things at Cuddle Parties:
　
1. Practice consent.
  A key part of Cuddle Parties is learning how to communicate your desires and how to respect others' requests.
2. Consensual platonic touch.
  Optionally experience and appreciate caring touch from other like-minded people.
　
We’ll start with an Welcome Circle to get us settled. We’ll then go through the rules of Cuddle Party in a mini communication workshop, allowing participants to practice inner awareness and clear expression of boundaries.
　
After the communication workshop, we'll have 2 or more hours of Self-Directed Connection
　
    Now it is time for you to ask for what you want, say yes and no to requests and invitations, cuddle according to your desires and comfort (or just talk if you prefer), connect with fascinating people, "cuddle mingle," and, ultimately, relax into the flow of an unusually playful and respectful social environment.
　
    Some participants cuddle in groups, others one-on-one, while some like to talk and not cuddle for a time, or not at all. Cuddling can mean feet against feet, full-body hugs, head-rubs, spooning — it is, indeed, up to you. And, configurations and positions shift significantly throughout the event, thanks in part to Rule 6 Change your mind & keep yourself happy.

We'll finish with a closing circle to reflect on our experience.
　
=== Why? ===
　
Clear communication allows more harmonious relationships, regardless of the context.
　
Nurturing and consensual touch supports a healthy life, strong nervous system, and balanced emotions.
　
=== What to bring ===
　
Comfortable clothes/pajamas (more drawstrings, less lace)
　
Blankets, pillows, or other soft items to enhance your experience are optional.
　
We will have bottled water, tea, and breath-friendly snacks. Feel free to bring your own if you prefer.
　
Please do NOT wear heavy scents or perfumes, as people may be sensitive to them. Please shower and lightly deodorize if desired, but skip the scented products.
　
=== When ===
　
HUMANDATE
　
Doors will open at FIRST_GATHERING_TIME.
　
Please arrive between FIRST_GATHERING_TIME and ARRIVE_BY_TIME so we can be settled and start our Welcome Circle at EVENT_TIME.
　
To maintain the integrity of the container, no one will be admitted after we start the Welcome Circle. Allowing late arrivals could disrupt the flow of introductions and discussions about boundaries and consent that help establish the supportive environment of the cuddle party.
　

The Welcome Circle will last around an hour, then you are welcome to stay for Self-Directed Connection, socializing, and snacks. The space will be available until 15_B4_RENTAL_ENDS.

=== About me, “Barefoot” Rob Nugen ===
　
I have a passion for connecting with the world around me, especially walking barefoot. This helps me to stay grounded, and appreciate the beauty of the present moment. I’m leading Cuddle Party events to help welcome us back into connection after an isolating pandemic.
　
I have been running a men’s peer counseling group in Tokyo since 2015, and conducting in-person workshops in both Tokyo and Kanagawa since 2018.
