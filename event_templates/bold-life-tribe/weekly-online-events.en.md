February is the month of __TRUTH__

#### This Week:

In order to proceed in life cleanly, we sometimes have to state hard truths to people in our lives - as well as state them to ourselves.  But we don’t have to SAY them hard.  We can speak our truths either with a sword or a feather - depending on whom we are speaking to - and how they are able to hear us.

#### Costs: ####

~~10,000 yen per month~~

*5,000 yen* per month (intro price until February 28th!)

Enjoy your first meeting as my guest.
