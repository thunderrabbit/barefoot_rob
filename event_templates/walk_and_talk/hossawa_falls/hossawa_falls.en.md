Refresh your spirit. Touch the earth. Connect with nature.

Barefoot Walking Experience:

Slow-paced barefoot hike to Hossawa Falls
(one of the hundred famous waterfalls in Japan,
located in Nishitama District, Tokyo),
and the small mountain Bonbori.
We will also enjoy Seoto-no-yu foot bath and
free time near the Minamiaki River after the hike.

Barefoot Rob and others will be barefoot;
you’re welcome to try hiking barefoot as well!
